	abstract = {Multi-step ahead time series forecasting is essential in Internet of Things (IoT) applications in smart cities and smart homes to make accurate future predictions and precise decision-making. Thus, this study introduces a novel multiple-input single-output (MISO) forecasting method called Multi-Step Embedding-based Fuzzy Time Series (MS-EFTS), designed to predict high-dimensional non-stationary time series data. As a first-order approach, it employs a direct strategy that integrates an embedding transformation with a weighted multivariate FTS (WMVFTS) model. This combination allows for effective predictions over long-term horizons within low-dimensional, learned continuous representations. The effectiveness of the proposed MS-EFTS is assessed using three high-dimensional IoT time series in this investigation. The obtained results showcase the superior performance of the proposed method compared to some deep learning forecasting methods, including LSTM, BiLSTM, TCN, and CNN-LSTM, in terms of accuracy, parsimony, and efficiency.  © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a transformative technology that allows interconnected devices to exchange data over the Internet, enabling automation and real-time decision making in a variety of areas. A key aspect of the success of the IoT lies in its integration with low-resource hardware, such as low-cost microprocessors and microcontrollers. These devices, which are affordable and energy efficient, are capable of handling basic tasks such as sensing, processing, and data transmission. Their low cost makes them ideal for IoT applications in low-income communities where the government is often absent. This review aims to present some applications—such as a flood detection system; a monitoring system for analog and digital sensors; an air quality measurement system; a mesh video network for community surveillance; and a real-time fleet management system—that use low-cost hardware such as ESP32, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino, and the MQTT protocol used to implement low-cost monitoring systems applied to improve the quality of life of people in small cities or communities. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Since the transition from an agricultural to an industrial economy, cities have attracted large masses of people in search of their facilities. Cities are symbols of progress and opportunities. However, urbanization also brings with it several problems and challenges. Smart Cities (SC) offer a way to address these challenges by using technology to make cities more efficient, sustainable, and livable. There are numerous technologies that enable the concept of smart cities, including the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT provides the fundamental sensing infrastructure that allows connecting and virtualizing the physical world, extracting environmental variables that serve as initial inputs for decision-making processes. Such processes are provided by software systems whose construction and execution need to deal with the dynamism, heterogeneity and often serendipitous nature that permeate both the domains of smart cities and IoT. As the integration of IoT and Smart Cities paradigms is still at an early stage, and there are not yet holistic solutions to explore the full potential of such a synergy, we carried out a literature review on the topic. In particular, the objective of this article is to describe the results of a structured literature review to identify general concepts about quality attributes, applications, technologies, and challenges of IoT solutions applied to the SC domain. Our main goal is to assist in understanding the basic concepts of the research area through the search for secondary studies. This review is a tertiary study covering 17 reviews and aims to promote a high-level discussion on the identified characteristics and provide an overview of the area to promote a better perception of current development needs and opportunities. © 2024, Brazilian Computing Society.

	abstract = {According to the World Health Organization (WHO), melanoma is a type of cancer that affects people globally in different parts of the human body, leading to deaths of thousands of people every year worldwide. Intelligent diagnostic tools through automatic detection in medical images are extremely effective in aiding medical diagnosis. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are of utmost importance for image-based pre-diagnosis, and the use of artificial intelligence–based tools for monitoring, detection, and segmentation of the pathological region are increasingly used in integrated smart solutions within smart city systems through cloud data processing with the use of edge computing. This study proposes a new approach capable of integrating into computational monitoring and medical diagnostic assistance systems called Health of Things Melanoma Detection System (HTMDS). The method presents a deep learning–based approach using the YOLOv8 network for melanoma detection in dermatoscopic images. The study proposes a workflow through communication between the mobile device, which extracts captured images from the dermatoscopic device and uploads them to the cloud API, and a new approach using deep learning and different fine-tuning models for melanoma detection and segmentation of the region of interest, along with the cloud communication structure and comparison with methods found in the state of the art, addressing local processing. The new approach achieved satisfactory results with over 98% accuracy for detection and over 99% accuracy for skin cancer segmentation, surpassing various state-of-the-art works in different methods, such as manual, semi-automatic, and automatic approaches. The new approach demonstrates effective results in the performance of different intelligent automatic models with real-time processing, which can be used in affiliated institutions or offices in smart cities for population use and medical diagnosis purposes.

	abstract = {Flooding in urban areas is expected to become even more common due to climatic changes, putting pressure on cities to implement effective response measures. Practical mechanisms for assessing flood risk have become highly desired, but existing solutions have been devoted to evaluating only specific cities and consider only limited risk perspectives, constraining their general applicability. This article presents an innovative approach for assessing the flood risk of delimited urban areas by exploiting geospatial information from publicly available databases, providing a method that is applicable to any city in the world and requiring minimum configurations. A set of mathematical equations is defined for numerically assessing risk levels based on elevation, slope, and proximity to rivers, while the existence of emergency-related urban infrastructure is considered as a risk reduction factor. Then, computed risk levels are used to classify areas, allowing easy visualisation of flood risk for a city. This smart city approach not only serves as a valuable tool for assessing the expected flood risk based on different parameters but also facilitates the implementation of cutting-edge strategies to effectively mitigate critical situations, ultimately enhancing urban resilience to flood-related disaster. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Smart City Applications encompass many characteristics that increase the risk of failures, such as context-awareness, adaptiveness, distribution and heterogeneity. Therefore, it is important to implement fault-tolerant mechanisms to produce more reliable applications. This study presents a systematic literature review of fault tolerance techniques that have been proposed for, or applied to Smart City Applications. It also characterizes faults, errors and failures that may occur in these systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review that provides a broad picture of the research area and points out research limitations and directions. We selected 43 primary studies and performed initial classifications (e.g., based on type of research, type of contribution, application domains and subdomains, and type of system architecture). We further classified and discussed the selected studies based on types of fault tolerance techniques and types of faults and failures. System Reconfiguration, Diversity, and Retry are classical techniques that have been investigated in this domain. Many fault and failure types have also been addressed. While those well-known techniques have been explored for introducing fault tolerance capabilities into Smart City Applications, others have been overlooked. Moreover, evidence on the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed fault tolerance solutions is still very limited.

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has changed different applications and markets, making them even more engaging and user-centered in Smart Cities, Smart Farms, and e-health. One such sector that has benefited from these capabilities is precision agriculture, which has seen increased productivity and more efficient and intelligent management through AI and cloud computing. By bringing computing resources closer to clients, edge devices are able to embed AI solutions near the client, reducing the time it takes to transfer data to High-Performance Computing (HPC) centers. The latest approaches explore lightweight or distributed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) methods for training and prediction tasks in edge devices using medical, satellite, or precision agriculture images. In this paper, we hypothesized that prediction tasks in precision agriculture can be more easily and seamlessly assigned to edge devices as long as pre-trained AI models are embedded in these devices through Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) Architecture. Hence, we propose and evaluate a general-purpose image classification system for edge devices that uses an AI Model Store for edge intelligence empowerment. We conducted a case study on precision agriculture to functionally assess cognitive service delivery performance, including prediction time, memory, and CPU usage, and found a suitable model embodiment on edge devices compared with HPC. © 2024 IEEE.},

Remote patient healthcare monitoring, in particular, benefits society as it unburdens hospitals and helps patients with chronic diseases. Analyzing the health status with IoT and Artificial Intelligence (AI) is new in the digital community. The literature yet presents a limited number of references explicitly concerning the topic of qualified data acquisition. In this sense, the present literature review aims to update the joint subject of IoT and vital signs, seeking to understand the state-of-the-art and future directions. We have analyzed 78 articles and IoT manufacturer websites that address vital signs collection to answer a group of primary and specific questions. In particular, we revisited architectures, communication protocols, data acquisition mechanisms, evaluation metrics, and how to efficiently transfer data through the lens of sensors, actuators, and healthcare. Currently, two themes are considered as promising directions for studies in the joint area of IoT and vital sign-based healthcare monitoring. The first is the connection promotion between third-party applications and IoT devices to collect and process time-critical data with the support of edge, fog, and cloud infrastructures. The second theme again brings the focus to data compression methodologies since monitoring vital signs in a smart city geographical area naturally requires strategies to optimize network bandwidth consumption and data storage on computational resources. Moreover, both themes are directly linked to energy-saving approaches and quality of service (QoS) for efficient patient healthcare checking. © 2024 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {This work takes aim at how challenging image segmentation tasks where edges are blurred still are. As a consequence, evolutionary neural computing (ENC) is introduced to develop an enhanced segmentation model for such scenes. This calls for strong computing power and sufficient bearing capacity. In future smart cities, fortunately, cybertwin-assisted pervasive computing has been a more practical way to facilitate deploying various intelligent perception tasks. Thus, this paper uses a cybertwin-assisted pervasive computing framework for edgeblurred image segmentation using ENC. The technical methodology comprises two main parts, namely the backbone network and parameter evolution. On the one hand, the grayscale segmentation is first transferred as a pixel-level binary classification task. The main network structure of the proposal is a convolution neural network model composed of several computing layers and one parameter updating layer. Alternatively, the adaptive genetic algorithm is introduced to re-optimize parameters during each round. Two groups of real-world images are collected to construct experimental scenarios for carrying out two aspects of assessment work. For one thing, the training process of the proposed model is visualized to inspect its training effect. For another, the proposed model is compared with three baseline methods to prove its performance superiority. In conclusion, the introduction of evolutionary computing can produce improvements of more than 10 percentage points. © This is an Open Access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/) which permits unrestricted non-commercial use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.},

	abstract = {Background: The low power wide area networks (LPWANs) technologies significantly impact numerous IoT deployment use cases, especially in the smart cities' scenario. LPWAN is used to support low data rate use cases. Unfortunately, medium data rate (up to 50 Mbps and more) IoT applications are not operational by LPWAN. Hence, a 5G reduced capability (RedCap) new radio (NR) device was provided to address this limitation. However, the 5G RedCap suffers a coverage loss due to the reduction of the physical layer complexity of the 5G legacy user equipment (UE). Therefore, 5G RedCap enhancements require coverage loss compensation. Objective: This paper aims to improve the performance of 5G RedCap in terms of coverage, energy efficiency, and throughput for Smart Cities and Industrial IoT (IIoT) using a genetic algorithm based neural network (GA-NN) model. Methods: The method involves using a GA-NN model for a two-fold enhancement of the 5G RedCap. This enhancement includes a specialized-enhancement RedCap (se-RedCap) for low data rates and an enhanced RedCap (eRedCap) for high data rates (up to 300 Mbps) support. The GA-NN model has been implemented and assessed in MATLAB Global Optimization and 5G Toolbox. Furthermore, an introduced and modified parametric rectified linear unit (ePReLU) activation function fA evaluates the final summation data parameters trained with a specific threshold for the best performance. Results: The numerical results confirm that the specialized-enhancement RedCap (se-RedCap) and enhanced RedCap (eRedCap) outperform legacy cellular LPWANs and conventional RedCap when considering coverage, energy efficiency, and throughput. Conclusion: This paper successfully covers two types of usage scenarios: the very low data rate typically seen in LPWAN and the high data rate of up to 300 Mbps, which is not yet compatible with the existing RedCap system. As a result, the GA-NN model creates se-RedCap and eRedCap, providing support for these two scenarios, respectively. © 2025 Bentham Science Publishers.},

	abstract = {Smart cities leverage information and communication technologies to enhance urban life quality, essential in densely populated environments requiring comprehensive planning. A critical area in urban settings is food production and delivery, where effective management becomes vital. New technologies can assist, but require models that support innovative production and commercialization methods. This study proposes an integration model between family farming—producers of organic food—and urban areas—consumers of these products. The model focuses on the management of organic food production and delivery to meet urban demands, serving as a tool in the transformation of these areas into smart municipalities. Additionally, this study suggests an alternative certification method for organic food production within family farming. A systematic literature review was conducted using the Methodi Ordinatio methodology. Content analysis of the selected articles identified strategies cities can adopt to promote organic certification, emphasizing transparent governance, public food procurement policies, and participatory certification systems. The proposed model aims to reduce bureaucracy and improve family farmers’ income, aligning with several Sustainable Development Goals: SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth), SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 15 (Life on Land), and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals). © 2025 by the authors.},

A solution is a smart city that implements technology to make health smarter, enables healthcare access, and contributes to all residents’ overall well-being. Thus, this paper proposes an architecture to deliver smart health. The architecture is anchored in the Internet of Things and edge computing, and it is driven by artificial intelligence to establish three foundational layers in smart care. Experimental results in a case study on glucose prediction noninvasively show that the architecture senses and acquires data that capture relevant characteristics. The study also establishes a baseline of twelve regression algorithms to assess the non-invasive glucose prediction performance regarding the mean squared error, root mean squared error, and r-squared score, and the catboost regressor outperforms the other models with 218.91 and 782.30 in MSE, 14.80 and 27.97 in RMSE, and 0.81 and 0.31 in (Formula presented.), respectively, on training and test sets. Future research works involve extending the performance of the algorithms with new datasets, creating and optimizing embedded AI models, deploying edge-IoT with embedded AI for wearable devices, implementing an autonomous AI cloud engine, and implementing federated learning to deliver scalable smart health in a smart city context. © 2024 by the authors.},

This paper describes a decentralized, proactive, and agent-based communication model. To validate the proposal, we applied our approach to a physical prototype of smart city devices. In this scenario, we include the interaction of different MAS in a simulation’s flood scenario. The results show the architecture’s effectiveness in collecting real-time data, providing a reliable, low-cost way to integrate citizens and governments during crises. The architecture is a promising approach for crisis management applications that takes advantage of the autonomous behavior of agents in MAS, improving the obtaining of subsidies to feed systems in smart cities and assisting decision-making. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.},

	abstract = {With the advent of Industry 5.0, the electrical sector has been endowed with intelligent devices that are propelling high penetration of distributed energy microgeneration, VPP, smart buildings, and smart plants and imposing new challenges on the sector. This new environment requires a smarter network, including transforming the simple electricity customer into a “smart customer” who values the quality of energy and its rational use. The SPG (smart power grid) is the perfect solution for meeting these needs. It is crucial to understand energy use to guarantee quality of service and meet data security requirements. The use of simulations to map the behavior of complex infrastructures is the best strategy because it overcomes the limitations of traditional analytical solutions. This article presents the ICT laboratory structure developed within the Department of Electrical Engineering of the Polytechnic School of the Universidade de São Paulo (USP). It is based on an architecture that utilizes LTE/EPC wireless technology (4G, 5G, and B5G) to enable machine-to-machine communication (mMTC) between SPG elements using edge computing (MEC) resources and those of smart city platforms. We evaluate this proposal through simulations using data from real and emulated equipment and co-simulations shared by SPG laboratories at POLI-USP. Finally, we present the preliminary results of integration of the power laboratory, network simulation (ns-3), and a smart city platform (InterSCity) for validation and testing of the architecture. © 2025 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Over the years, the imbalance between population needs and urban spaces’ organized development has been accentuated by increasing urbanization. The implementation of smart city actions began in the 1990s, with the development of integrated solutions in cities, harmonizing social, environmental, and economic aspects. This research measures the impact of thematic areas on smart cities’ management performance. The multi-criteria Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) method was used to identify the interdependent relations between smart cities’ thematic areas, structuring a diagram of cause-and-effect relations using threshold quantification values. Considering their degree of importance in smart city management, the thematic areas of technology and innovation, living environment and infrastructure, education and training, and governance and engagement are highlighted. For the degree of influence, the most influential thematic areas are coexistence and reciprocity, living environment and infrastructure, entrepreneurship, and healthcare. Also, the cause-and-effect analysis identified governance and engagement, education and training, and mobility as central thematic areas for smart city management. Finally, the research construct was developed by ranking the thematic areas’ performance in urban space planning. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Electricity companies are accelerating the process of implementing smart grids. Two main components of the smart grid architecture are the communication networks for Distribution Automation (DA) and Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), responsible for communicating with the smart meters installed at the user's premises. This work focuses on planning the wireless backhaul network that supports communication networks for DA and AMI. Backhaul networking involves deploying wireless communication devices to establish wireless links for interconnecting routers, gateways, and automation equipment. Planning these wireless links can be quite challenging due to the geographical diversity of deployment environments, inaccuracies in propagation models in heterogeneous areas (rural, suburban, and urban), and the necessity for detailed databases of soil relief and coverage, which are generally paid and high cost. This paper introduces a satellite imagery-assisted algorithm designed to facilitate efficient link budget analysis for wireless links in smart grid backhaul network planning. The satellite-assisted method classifies the terrain and makes it possible to aggregate loss information from various types of obstructions, such as trees, buildings, and the elevation of the terrain itself. The method uses information from open terrain databases for predictions. The algorithm's performance was validated using real link measurements from a smart grid wireless backhaul network. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

	abstract = {Although there are different theories about the adoption and implementation of technological innovation by companies, they have an organization/individual-centered approach. The aim of this study is to propose the Technology–Organization–External–Sustainability (TOES) framework, a technology adoption theory, an extension of the Technology-Organization-(business) Environment (TOE) framework, to assist companies in adopting and implementing technology through a holistic approach. Design Science Research was used to structure the TOES framework and the Delphi method for its evaluation and improvement. To examine the potential of the TOES framework, 40 maturity and readiness models found in the literature were examined, which were created to assist in Industry 4.0 implementation projects, according to their common element of analysis—their dimensions. An important finding was that the TOES framework allowed us to identify that most of these models focused predominantly on technology; therefore, they do not always allow for a general analysis of the company, nor do they consider the external competitive scenario or sustainability as relevant contexts for analysis. The theoretical and practical contribution lies in the presentation of the TOES framework that incorporates sustainability as a relevant context for analysis, expanding the theory of the adoption of technological innovation. Another theoretical contribution is to alert researchers that maturity and readiness models for Industry 4.0 implementation projects should take a more holistic approach. It is suggested to use the TOES framework in other areas of knowledge, such as medicine, engineering, technology, and science, among others, to test its potential. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The traditional electric power distribution network is evolving to support scalable and connected services in Smart Cities (SC). The emergence of Smart Grid (SG) architecture connects Smart Meters (SM) to the Electric Power Company (EPC) using various communication technologies like Power Line Communication (PLC) and wireless networks such as 5G, LoRa, and others. However, the vast amount of data generated by this infrastructure can lead to network overload and storage and processing challenges. To address this, this paper proposes implementing a Big Data Analytics framework under the Hybrid Demand Side Management as a Service (HyDSMaaS) architecture in the Multi Microgrid scenario. This approach divides the SG into Microgrids, creating smaller groups of nodes and transforming the centralized infrastructure into a scalable and decentralized one. Additionally, a monitoring system using Grafana was implemented to manage server usage flow and monitor access and services. The framework achieved high speed compared to traditional models and demonstrated accuracy of nearly 99.9% in consumption prediction and power quality classification algorithms when operating with up to 1000 microgrids in under 1000 seconds. © 2024 IEEE.},

Therefore, we aim to provide state-of-the-art information regarding privacy issues in the context of IoT, with a particular focus on findings that utilize the Personal Data Store (PDS) as a viable solution for these concerns. To achieve this, we conduct a systematic mapping review to identify, evaluate, and interpret the relevant literature on privacy issues and PDS-based solutions in the IoT context. Our analysis is guided by three well-defined research questions, and we systematically selected 49 studies published until 2023 from an initial pool of 176 papers. We analyze and discuss the most common privacy issues highlighted by the authors and position the role of PDS technologies as a solution to privacy issues in the IoT context. As a result, our findings reveal that only a small number of works (approximately 20%) were dedicated to presenting solutions for privacy issues. Most works (almost 82%) were published between 2018 and 2023, demonstrating an increased interest in the theme in recent years. Additionally, only two works used PDS-based solutions to deal with privacy issues in the IoT context. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) networks are a promising solution for Internet of Things (IoT) applications that require low power consumption and long-range coverage. These wireless networks enable data transmission between IoT devices and gateways, which are responsible for capturing and relaying messages to a server. However, LoRaWAN network planning involves complex issues, such as determining the number and positioning of gateways, which can impact data transmission efficiency. In this context, this work introduces LoRaWAN IoT Simulation and Optimization Environment Planning (LoRaWISEP) - a Software as a Service (SaaS) designed to assist LoRaWAN network planning through simulations that enable the quantification and positioning of gateways. LoRaWISEP is characterized as a Decision Support tool, aiding in the design of LoRaWAN network infrastructure. The system is developed based on Design Thinking, encompassing stages of immersion, ideation, prototyping, and development to ensure the software meets user needs and offers suitable usability. The study is characterized as a descriptive and qualitative approach. Consequently, the proposed tool can assist in LoRaWAN network planning with an interface that allows easy configuration of parameters, such as the selection of quantification and gateway positioning algorithms. Additionally, the system provides performance results, such as Packet Delivery Rate (PDR), which can be used to evaluate network performance. Therefore, LoRaWISEP facilitates LoRaWAN network planning, significantly contributing to the allocation of IoT devices in various scenarios, including smart cities and precision agriculture, which benefits the scientific community and professionals working with LoRaWAN. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This study aims to propose an approach for spatiotemporal integration of bus transit, which enables users to change bus lines by paying a single fare. This could increase bus transit efficiency and, consequently, help to make this mode of transit more attractive. Usually, this strategy is allowed for a few hours in a non-restricted area; thus, certain walking distance areas behave like “virtual terminals.” For that, two data-driven algorithms are proposed in this work. First, a new algorithm for detecting itineraries based on bus GPS data and the bus stop location. The proposed algorithm’s results show that 90% of the database detected valid itineraries by excluding invalid markings and adding times at missing bus stops through temporal interpolation. Second, this study proposes a bus stop clustering algorithm to define suitable areas for these virtual terminals where it would be possible to make bus transfers outside the physical terminals. Using real-world origin-destination trips, the bus network, including clusters, can reduce traveled distances by up to 50%, making twice as many connections on average. © 2024, J. Internet Serv.

A prototype was developed and tested in various usage scenarios to serve as a proof of concept. Furthermore, an experimental design n=3k=3 was employed to evaluate the solution's performance based on message quantity, message group size for data fusion, and outlier removal methods for some elements.

	abstract = {This study introduces a novel model designed to classify macrocauses of violent crimes. The model's practical application is demonstrated through its integration into the framework of the Natal Smart City Initiative in Brazil. Utilizing the Design Science methodology, the study details the model's development, its subsequent implementation through a machine learning pipeline, and its assessment employing four prominent classification techniques: Decision Trees, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. XGBoost performed exceptionally well, achieving an average accuracy of 0.961791, an F1-Score of 0.961410, and an AUC of ROC curve of 0.994732. Accurate classification of criminal macrocauses is crucial for developing effective public safety policies. The proposed model can provide public safety institutions and criminal analysts with a valuable tool for better understanding aspects related to violent crime analysis in their cities. This can streamline the analysis and management process and provide more accurate information for decision-making. This study also has important implications for the emerging field of smart cities. By providing a tool to assist in decision-making and planning public safety strategies, this work contributes to the development of innovative, data-based, and theory-based solutions to address urban challenges. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The majority of the global population now resides in cities, and this trend continues to grow. In this context, the Internet of Things (IoT) is crucial in transforming existing urban areas into Smart Cities. However, IoT architectures mainly focus on machine-to-machine interactions, leaving human involvement aside. The Internet of Everything (IoE) includes human-to-human and human–machine collaboration, but the specifics of these interactions are still under-explored. As urban populations grow and IoT integrates into city infrastructure, efficient, collaborative architectures become crucial. In this work, we use the Rapid Review methodology to analyze collaboration in four prevalent computing architectures in the IoE paradigm, namely Edge Computing, Cloud Computing, Blockchain/Web Services, and Fog Computing. To analyze the collaboration, we use the 3C collaboration model, comprising communication, cooperation, and coordination. Our findings highlight the importance of Edge and Cloud Computing for enhancing collaborative coordination, focusing on efficiency and network optimization. Edge Computing supports real-time, low-latency processing at data sources, while Cloud Computing offers scalable resources for diverse workloads, optimizing coordination and productivity. Effective resource allocation and network configuration in these architectures are essential for cohesive IoT ecosystems. Therefore, this work offers a comparative analysis of four computing architectures, clarifying their capabilities and limitations. Smart Cities are a major beneficiary of these insights. This knowledge can help researchers and practitioners choose the best architecture for IoT and IoE environments. Additionally, by applying the 3C collaboration model, the article provides a framework for improving collaboration in IoT and IoE systems. © 2024 by the authors.},

We apply vision transformers (ViTs) in a distributed fiber-optic sensing system to evaluate road traffic parameters in smart cities. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are also assessed for benchmarking. The experimental setup is based on a direct-detection phase-sensitive optical time-domain reflectometer ((Formula presented.) -OTDR) implemented using a narrow linewidth source. The monitored fibers are buried on the university campus, creating a smart city environment. Backscattered traces are consolidated into space–time matrices, illustrating traffic patterns and enabling analysis through image processing algorithms. The ground truth is established by traffic parameters obtained by processing video camera images monitoring the same street using the YOLOv8 model. The results indicate that ViTs outperform CNNs for estimating the number of vehicles and the mean vehicle speed. While a ViT necessitates a significantly larger number of parameters, its complexity is similar to that of a CNN when considering multiply–accumulate operations and random access memory usage. The processed dataset has been made publicly available for benchmarking. © 2025 by the authors.},

Because of the often desperate need for smart city objectives to be met, we sought to understand which were the capacities and whether the components of these capacities are explained sufficiently for them to be effective in practice. We applied a four-stage methodology commencing with a search of multiple databases for smart city capacity knowledge. We next assembled the evidence from the items identified in that search using a thematic analysis that identified the capacity to exploit technology, innovate, collaborate, and orchestrate. Next, we followed the threads of knowledge, iteratively allocating the knowledge to each of the four capacities to a typology of what, why, and who. The fourth stage was a cross-capacity analysis that generated further refinement and identified important factors. We identified that capacities are not sufficiently explained. In addition to the need for more levels of detail as to practical implementation, we identified significant underdevelopment of the literature as to the impact of institutional complexity and the influence of stakeholders. We propose research directed at increasing the effectiveness of capacities, define the concept of smart city capacities, propose a framework of the components of capacities, and draw on established stakeholder theory to create a stakeholder influence research framework. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The sustainability of cities is a challenge due to the growth, functioning, and needs of the population. In this context, the concept of the smart city has gained prominence worldwide in the last decades. In Brazil, it has also drawn attention driven by technological advances and the search for innovative solutions to urban challenges. Several different reports were created aiming to assess and categorize the advancement of cities in this regard. Some of them established their own indicators for this evaluation, whereas others are based on standards ISO 37120 and ISO 37122. The focus of this study revolves around the examination of indicators presently utilized, which may be influenced by initiatives grounded in the principles of green chemistry (PGCs). Furthermore, it explores how these principles can aid in the realization of the targets outlined in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set forth by the United Nations. Two case studies are presented, the first pointing out how PGCs and SDGs can correlate with smart city reporting indicators. The second is a case study centered on the Brazilian city of Curitiba (PR). We aim to exemplify how the city’s action plans underscore the significance of synergy among the principles of green chemistry, the objectives of sustainable development, and indicators for smart cities. Assessing how chemically green a city can be is a relevant argument for future industrial installations and stakeholders and the influence of this index on the quality of life of its population. Such an approach not only fosters innovation and efficiency but also fosters environmental stewardship, thus contributing to overall sustainability. © 2024 by the authors.},

These data differ from regular tabular data as they involve sequences of observations at successive, equally spaced points in time. The temporal ordering of observations in time series carries significant information, making pattern detection in subsequences crucial for supervised learning tasks such as forecasting and classification. Current classification methods often overlook the potential of transformations that represent time series as images. Visual representations such as Recurrence Plots and Markov Transition Fields capture intricate temporal dynamics and spatial patterns that traditional one-dimensional approaches might miss. We propose Visemble, an efficient and accurate ensemble method for time series classification that leverages multiple visual representations and weighted soft voting. Besides our proposal, we present a broader discussion regarding time series imaging representations. Visemble combines the original time domain representation, first-order differences, and various two-dimensional representations. Our ensemble integrates accurate and diverse classifiers to improve the classification performance of individual imaging based models efficiently using Random Forest. A comprehensive experimental evaluation with hundreds benchmark datasets from varying domains demonstrated that Visemble achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art ensemble based methods, such as Elastic Ensemble, BOSS, and Temporal Dictionary Ensemble, but with significantly reduced computational time. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a computational paradigm where connected devices share a common communication network to interact and provide various applications. In this context, the challenges for IoT and Software Engineering arise from the drive to create smart applications in various domains, such as smart cities, homes, and hospitals. Requirements analysis and software modeling are steps in building IoT systems that aim to ensure a good specification of the system. However, the literature lacks a well-established set of practices for these phases of IoT system development, especially regarding requirements analysis and system modeling. This results in a significant gap in knowledge and standardization of processes. Therefore, a solution that supports these stages of the IoT system development lifecycle is needed. This paper presents ReqM4IoT, a tool that integrates two previously developed techniques: ReqMLSCity, a specific technique for requirements analysis for IoT, and SysIoTML, a specific technique for software modeling for IoT. With this solution, the quality of the software can benefit significantly from using ReqM4IoT, as suggested by the initial evaluation conducted in this work. The evaluation involved five participants with different levels of experience but with a common knowledge base in Software Engineering and IoT. The experiment aimed to evaluate the feasibility, usefulness, and ease of use of the tool in the development of IoT applications. The results indicated that the tool is useful and the participants were able to effectively solve the proposed problem. Although the evaluation pointed out opportunities for improvement, these insights pave the way for further enhancement of ReqM4IoT. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {This article focuses on fundamental human rights based on a historical literature review. Methodologically, a literature review and application of the design thinking (DT) method were used in three sessions using storytelling techniques and canvas drawings with managers specializing in “smart and sustainable city” projects in Brazil. The scientific work demonstrates that, in the view of the participating experts selected according to the research criteria, there are many gaps regarding fundamental human rights in cities. The digitalization of cities, with its layers of digital governance, alone is insufficient to cover gaps in basic information for populations. With the participants’ insights, it was possible to design and develop a software application (app) under strict requirements with anonymization and geolocations of human rights violations. The tests also highlighted limitations and future improvements. It is believed that the article brings an innovative approach from a scientific point of view, with a high degree of originality due to the outcomes generated from the experiences of the authors and managers specializing in managing new “smart cities”. This governance tool has the potential to be installed and improved in more than 30 countries and thus serve almost 70 million citizens around the world. A software technology transfer has already been made to the project’s partner company. © 2024 by the authors.},

Drawing on the existing concepts of smart community and smart governance, the study examines how smart governance practices empower individuals to work as a community. This evolution not only shapes local communities into more interconnected, innovative, and resilient entities but also fosters cohesion and the ability to engage in meaningful dialogue with public authorities. Preliminary findings, derived from 25 semi-structured interviews conducted with community leaders, community social center personell, entrepreneurs and consultants, City Hall representatives, and citizens, highlight crucial components contributing to how communities become smart. Ultimately, the study explores the mechanisms supporting the establishment of a smart community framework, contributing significantly to the application of governance and transition theories in the development of intelligent urban ecosystems. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

Method: Integrative Literature Review was used as the research instrument, analyzing in the articles: a) objective; b) research method; c) study subject (location); d) application of Digital Twin or Digital Shadow; e) Results and conclusions. Results: portfolio with 25 articles on the topic and qualitative analysis regarding objective, method, study location, Digital Twin technology, Digital Shadow, and results. Studies with elements of Digital Shadow are perceived timidly in two cases of smart cities in Brazil. Conclusions: smart city technologies should be centered on the interests of users to not lose their humanity. It is worth adding that people’s needs change and, therefore, smart technologies should have a forward-looking vision to anticipate the needs of future generations. Digital Twin technology is a model that can contribute in this sense, monitoring and providing readings of future scenarios for smart cities. © 2024, Programa de Pos-Graduacao em Gestao da Informacao, Universidade Federal do Parana.

With the Internet of Things (IoT), Bigdata, Business Intelligence, and other Information Communication Technologies, data can be gathered to support decisions in stages of the response to natural disaster events. In biological natural disasters, the ICTs can also support efforts to promote social distancing, public health, and economic monitoring to face the threads. São Paulo state used IoT in scenarios to face COVID-19, such as monitoring vehicular interurban mobility, social distancing, and economic activity. Frameworks, strategies, data views, and use cases are presented to support the decision-making process to face this biological natural disaster. The data-driven approach supports several purposes, including the communication of social distancing indices, economic recovery, the progression of contagion, and deaths. It also played a pivotal role in fostering transparency initiatives for society and supporting the crisis committee by facilitating situational analyses, and this approach became standard practice for pandemic response. Studies and innovative visualisation perspectives have produced positive outcomes, guiding the decision-making process through data analysis. Noteworthy use cases were interurban traffic fence monitoring; mapping of virus spreading; tracking the economic impact concerning recovery plans; and, evaluating the effectiveness of public policies. © 2024 The Authors.

Urban and peri-urban forests play a vital role in improving urban life by mitigating pollution, addressing heat island effects, managing flood risks, and enhancing water quality. These green infrastructures have been overshadowed in the smart city agenda, primarily focused on the transportation and energy sectors. Drawing from the experience of a medium-sized Brazilian city in nurturing a technology startup ecosystem toward becoming a smart city, this chapter aims to provide insights into the practical employment of these emerging technologies for territorial monitoring and regulation. The case illustrates how remote sensing can map changes in urban forests to aid in policy development and should encourage community engagement. At the core lies the concept of “smart green governance,” emphasizing technology-driven collaboration between local governments and citizens. Remote sensing tools, including high-resolution satellite imagery and methods like QR codes for tree labeling and geopositioning, may empower local authorities to identify, quantify, and make informed decisions about urban and peri-urban trees. These technologies support urban afforestation projects, environmental assessments, and regulatory compliance. The chapter aims to aid researchers, policymakers, and practitioners in creating environmentally sustainable and livable cities through remote sensing and public governance. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2025.},

Problem: Universities have large parking lots with many vehicles and face daily security problems, such as robberies and kidnappings, due to the lack of cameras capable of detecting suspicious behavior and alerting security personnel. Solution: Our approach enhances security in the university environment by developing a system capable of recognizing vehicles and individuals, assessing their proximity, and detecting gestures and actions labeled as suspicious behavior while interoperating with camera systems to alert the appropriate security authorities. Information systems theory: This work was conceived based on the General System Theory to interact with pre-existing heterogeneous systems. It relates to the Technological Frames of Reference theory, which involves the perception and interpretation of real-time object detection technology to monitor, alert, and ensure security. Method: Our research method is an experimental, descriptive investigation of collecting quantitative data, and our evaluation is conducted through the proof of concept. Results: Our artifact demonstrated its feasibility by exhibiting good performance, enabling the detection of pre-defined suspicious behaviors near vehicles with a precision of 94,25% and accuracy of 86,99%. Contributions and Impact in the area of information systems: Our contributions are two-fold: From the organization's perspective, our security system interoperability, generating interoperable alerts; the artifact to detect suspicious behaviors, protecting people in the University environment. Our approach impacts the three pilars from IS area: People, Process and Technology. Additionally, we provide a dataset of security camera videos in university parking lots.  © 2024 ACM.},

However, the charging infrastructure is the main drawback to increasing the adoption of electric vehicles. The limited number of charging stations in the cities is an obstacle to the wide adoption of electric vehicles. Therefore, this work proposes to study solutions for the location and installation of charging stations in the context of smart cities. The paper presents three solutions: (i) random, being a naive approach for comparison; (ii) pseudo-random, where the road map is divided into quadrants and a charging station is installed randomly within each quadrant; and (iii) pseudo-greedy, in which the road map is divided into quadrants and the most visited street by vehicles within the quadrant is selected to install a charging station. These approaches are compared using the TAPAS Cologne map and an urban mobility simulator, which considers electric vehicles and charging during their routes.  © 2024 IEEE.},

As the global population increases and moves to urban areas, there is a growing need for utilities such as water, electricity, gas, and others. The current Smart City concept is strongly tied to Information and Communication Technology (ICT) towards improving sustainability and ensuring efficient usage of scarce resources in the urban area. This paper intends to evaluate Graph Neural Networks (GNN), a class of graph-based Deep Learning algorithms, to detect and locate water leakage under the data availability restrictions of Low Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWAN), a popular class of wireless sensor networks in IoT/Smart Cities applications. A case study Water Distribution Network (WDN) was developed to obtain data for training and validation. Also, linear regression was employed to minimize the number of sensor nodes, aiming to reduce implementation costs. The results indicate that the graph-based approach tied with linear regression in intermediate nodes can provide up to 80% accuracy, even under the data restrictions of LPWAN. Also, the usage of linear regression improved the mean accuracy of the GNN algorithm by approximately 18% in all three simulated cases in comparison to the situation without data from intermediate (junction) nodes, even with 37% fewer sensor nodes available.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Fog computing can provide computational resources and low-latency communication at the network edge. But with it comes uncertainties that must be managed in order to guarantee Service Level Agreements. Service observability can help the environment better deal with uncertainties, delivering relevant and up-to-date information in a timely manner to support decision making. Observability is considered a superset of monitoring since it uses not only performance metrics, but also other instrumentation domains such as logs and traces. However, as Fog Computing is typically characterised by resource-constrained nodes and network uncertainties, increasing observability in fog can be risky due to the additional load injected into a restricted environment. There is no work in the literature that evaluated fog observability. In this paper, we first outline the challenges of achieving observability in a Fog environment, based on which we present a formal definition of fog observability. Subsequently, a real-world Fog Computing testbed running a smart city use case is deployed, and an empirical evaluation of fog observability using open-source tools is presented. The results show that under certain conditions, it is viable to provide observability in a Fog Computing environment using open-source tools, although it is necessary to control the overhead modifying their default configuration according to the application characteristics. © ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering 2024.},

	abstract = {The Strategic Planning (SP) of a Smart City (SC) must consider several smart and innovative dimensions, e.g., economy, mobility, environment, people, life, and governance. In these dimensions, there may be many components that require consideration of the innovation aspect. In the innovation context, using recent technologies is mandatory. Constructing SP for cities is one central aspect of the SC concept, mainly if the SP is built considering the participation of the population, which has been the Brazilian case. Considering the Brazilian scenario, many cities have constructed their specific SPs. A SP of a city considers specific local aspects, including local culture and geographical localization. Another reason a Brazilian city aims to be smarter is both being part of Brazilian SC ranks and receiving specific funding from the federal government for city smart projects. There are many cases in Brazil where the construction process of a city SP counts on the participation of undergraduate and graduate programs of Brazilian universities, as they can contribute to innovative technological solutions, which was the case of Niterói City Hall. The city constructed a program with the Fluminense Federal University (UFF) to meet the goals established in Niterói SP and the 2030 agenda of the United Nations (UN). This work aims to present a case study of the results of a Development Program of Applied Projects, called PDPA, and measures how much computational solutions of its projects meet the goals of the Niterói SP. We are particularly interested in understanding the role of software artifacts in the innovation processes of SC.  © 2024 held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodivergent condition with a wide range of characteristics and support levels. Individuals with ASD can exhibit various combinations of traits such as difficulties in social interaction, communication, and language, alongside restricted interests and repetitive activities. Many adults with ASD live independently due to increased awareness and late diagnoses, which help them manage long-standing challenges. Predictability, clarity, and minimized sensory stimuli are crucial for the daily comfort of autistic individuals. In mobile applications, autistic users face significant cognitive overload compared to neurotypicals, resulting in higher effort and time to complete tasks. Urban mobility apps, essential for daily routines, often overlook the needs of autistic users, leading to cognitive overload issues. This study investigates the accessibility of urban mobility apps for autistic individuals using the Interfaces Accessibility Guide for Autism (GAIA). By evaluating various apps, we have identified a common gap regarding accessibility for people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This limitation relates to the absence of a functionality that allows users on the autism spectrum to customize the characteristics of the textual and visual elements of the software, such as changing the text font, altering the font type, and adjusting text colors, as well as native audio guidance within the applications themselves. Currently, the only function in this context is for visually impaired people, which completely changes the user experience in terms of navigation. © 2024 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Sensitive information needs to be transmitted through long-distance areas in many scenarios as healthcare, agricultural production and smart cities. Not only security, but also performance in this particular type of communication is not a trivial match. The LoRaWAN protocol is capable of transmitting data between IoT as end devices to application servers where the data can be analyzed and stored. The protocol offers a significant security standard and a recognized performance in long-range communication at low cost. However, the advances in Quantum Computing also bring threats to the current state of cryptographic algorithms, possibly compromising communication privacy. LoRaWAN's security is based on AES-128 cryptographic algorithm, which is not safe to quantum computers. Thus, this work proposes an enhancement in LoraWAN's security protocol adding the Kyber KEM-1024 algorithm to reinforce the protocol against quantum-computing attacks. The implementation successfully simulated the communication between an end device and an application server performing the post-quantum algorithm KEM-1024. Despite the results for time of execution can be improved, the proposal presented a safe communication resistant to quantum-computing attacks.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) is a critical challenge in various industrial applications, such as autonomous systems, smart cities, and audio surveillance, which require accurate identification and localization of sound events in complex environments. Traditional supervised approaches heavily rely on large, annotated multichannel audio datasets, which are expensive and time-consuming to produce. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing the w2v-SELD architecture, a self-supervised model adapted from the wav2vec 2.0 framework to learn effective sound event representations directly from raw, unlabeled 3D audio data. The proposed model follows a two-stage process: pre-training on large, unlabeled 3D audio datasets to capture high-level features, followed by fine-tuning with a smaller, labeled SELD dataset. Experimental results show that our w2v-SELD method outperforms baseline models on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) challenges, achieving a 66% improvement for DCASE TAU-2019 and a 57% improvement on DCASE TAU-2020 with respect to baseline systems. The w2v-SELD model performs competitively with state-of-the-art supervised methods, highlighting its potential to significantly reduce the dependency on labeled data in industrial SELD applications. The code and pre-trained parameters of our w2v-SELD model are available in this repository.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The urbanisation of the last century has created a significant demand for urban areas to deliver public services that are efficient, sustainable, and adaptable. This demand is further amplified by the anticipated impacts of climate change and the complexities introduced by rapidly expanding urban populations. In this scenario, smart city initiatives have emerged as a pivotal strategy to address these challenges, leveraging innovative technologies and paradigms such as Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science to improve the quality of urban life in a more sustainable way. Recently, research efforts in these domains have focused on creating systems that can adapt and respond to changing conditions, enabling greater adaptivity and responsiveness to the needs of urban landscapes. Therefore, this article provides a comprehensive survey of adaptive urban services within a smart city context. Through analyses of recent literature, we investigate the technological foundations that enable the adaptivity of urban services and explore their applications in various urban scenarios, including energy, mobility, emergency management, public safety, and waste management. This article also highlights the benefits of adopting adaptive urban services, such as improved traffic management, resilient emergency management, and enhanced citizen engagement, bringing an important contribution to this broad research area. Finally, we provide a discussion on current technology enablers and challenges and present an overview for future research directions on adaptive urban systems at the forefront of transforming cities into more intelligent ecosystems. © 2013 IEEE.},

Recent research in Software Engineering (SE) has investigated the characteristics of these systems and the most appropriate approaches to their design and development. IoT-based applications are strongly characterized by the interaction among multiple devices, users, and services. These characteristics make these applications complex and difficult to evaluate, particularly in terms of User Experience (UX) design. In this study, we performed a rapid systematic review to examine the methods and practices commonly employed for evaluating the UX of IoT-based applications for Smart Cities. We analyzed 43 studies covering different types of IoT-based applications, most in the area of Smart Home. Our findings indicate that user testing questionnaire-based (e.g., SUS - System Usability Scale and UEQ - User Experience Questionnaire) and interviews are the most used methods to evaluate IoT applications, while few studies mentioned user testing based on automated measurement or expert-based reviews. This work contributes to SE research by revealing the need to explore UX evaluation methods based on usage data and the combination of methods for continuous UX evaluation in the context of IoT and Smart Cities. © 2024 27th Ibero-American Conference on Software Engineering, CIbSE 2024.

	abstract = {Effective quality management plays a pivotal role in ensuring the smooth operation of smart city systems, which have significant implications for safety, accessibility, affordability, and maintainability. Dependability of autonomous systems is of utmost importance, as achieving satisfactory levels of availability and reliability poses considerable challenges. Smart cities are characterized by interconnected sub-architectures, encompassing vehicle monitoring, sidewalk monitoring, and building monitoring, all of which need to function efficiently. Analytical models such as Petri nets, Markov chains, and fault trees are well-suited for evaluating complex scenarios in the context of smart cities. This paper presents analytical models that utilize fault tree and Markov chain techniques to assess the availability and reliability of smart city monitoring systems. The model is divided into shared and non-shared components, with non-shared components being specific to certain contextual applications, while shared components, such as data processing and electrical power, are essential for all smart city monitoring and management systems. The study underscores the ease with which the fault tree model can enhance availability by modifying failure requirements and resources. Case studies provide concrete examples of how availability improved from 95.3 to 99.8% by varying a configuration known as "KooN" in multiple components. This paper takes a comprehensive approach to evaluating the dependability of smart city architectures and contributes advancements, such as hierarchical modeling, sequential sensitivity analysis, and the "KooN" analytic method. These contributions expand the existing knowledge and methodologies in smart city dependability analysis. Moreover, this work aims to serve as a practical tool to assist smart city managers in optimizing their proposals. All modeling aspects and parameters are detailed thoroughly to enable effective implementation of the proposed approach by anyone using it. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.},

	abstract = {The increasing reliance on Systems-of-Systems (SoS) across critical domains, such as emergency response, healthcare, and smart cities, underscores the need for reliable architectures capable of seamlessly accommodating new SoS missions that emerge at runtime. Designing reliable SoS architectures faces challenges in predicting emergent behaviors due to incomplete understanding of Constituent Systems (CS) behaviors at design time, dynamic changes in requirements, and environmental influences. At the same time, it lacks solutions for automatically generating SoS architectural reconfigurations at runtime. The main contribution of this paper is to present an approach named AUTONOMOUS that can automatically generate SoS architectural configurations. AUTONOMOUS refers to a process for functional suitability that extracts information from SoS mission models, engineers a model generator, and finally generates the architectural configurations. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach through a case study in the space domain. Results demonstrate success in generating SoS architectural configurations, indicating that AUTONOMOUS could be further explored as a mechanism to reconfigure SoS architectures automatically at runtime. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

The policies take into account the characteristics of the applications running on the network and the different specifications of the available devices. We implemented POSITRON in a network simulator aiming to analyze its efficiency in allocating network resources.

However, the focus on technological innovation often overlooks important concerns about digital equality, privacy, bias, and ethical governance. This paper aims to foster a shifting in the narrative towards these less discussed areas, arguing that the true measure of a smart city's success lies not only in its technological capabilities but also in its commitment to inclusivity, privacy, trust, and ethical integrity. This paper examines the inclusivity of smart services, emphasising the need for digital equality while also discussing privacy regulations and the role of trust in fostering citizen engagement. Additionally, it explores how decision-making can perpetuate inequalities and the importance of transparent governance. Such important discussions address ethical and social implications, which ultimately contribute to a more nuanced understanding of smart cities and advocates for policies and practices that prioritise social equity alongside technological innovations. © 2024 IEEE.},

V2X communication has the potential to improve traffic in smart cities drastically, but it plays a crucial role in terms of safety and the environment. The V2X communication can be completely impaired due to cyberattacks, including radio jamming, where the electromagnetic spectrum is interfered or blocked. In this paper, we propose three frameworks to deal with radio jamming in V2X applications. First, we present a batch framework, then a recursive framework, and finally, a subspace tracking framework. We validate the proposed frameworks considering the left turn assist driving use case, and we compare their performances. © 2024 IEEE.},

We addressed this challenge by conducting a systematic literature review on the use of the Internet of Things to promote smart education. Through a systematic literature review, we answered the following research questions: i) Which smart objects collect data from the physical world? ii) What types of information are collected? And, iii) what are the goals of collecting this data? Our analysis reveals that i) the most common smart objects in educational environments include sensors, cameras, ID tags, and wearable devices; ii) these devices collect data in twelve main categories, which include everything from microclimatic information to details of the emotional and behavioral state of the actors involved; iii) the purpose of this collection is to provide a more effective and personalized educational experience to individual needs.

Currently, these maintenance tasks rely predominantly on citizen reports or on-site checks by council staff. However, this approach has been shown to be time-consuming and highly costly, resulting in significant delays that negatively impact communities. This paper presents AIoT-CitySense, an AI and IoT-driven city-scale sensing framework, developed and piloted in collaboration with a local government in Australia. AIoT-CitySense has been designed to address the unique requirements of roadside infrastructure maintenance within the local government municipality. A tailored solution of AIoT-CitySense has been deployed on existing waste service trucks that cover a road network of approximately 100 kms in the municipality. Our analysis shows that proactive detection for roadside infrastructure maintenance using our solution reached an impressive 85%, surpassing the timeframes associated with manual reporting processes. AIoT-CitySense can potentially transform various domains, such as efficient detection of potholes and precise line marking for pedestrians.

	abstract = {Urbanization is a rapidly accelerating global phenomenon that challenges sustainable development, requiring innovative frameworks for understanding and managing urban complexity. This study explores the application of Complexity Theory in sustainable urban development, framing cities as Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS), where dynamic social, economic, environmental, and technological interactions generate emergent behaviors. A systematic literature review was conducted, analyzing 91 studies retrieved from Scopus that explicitly link Complexity Theory to urban sustainability. Key findings reveal trade-offs, such as balancing economic growth with ecological preservation and social equity, while emphasizing the role of self-organization and adaptive governance in enhancing urban resilience. Concrete examples include the application of fractal analysis in urban planning to predict sprawl and optimize infrastructure and the use of system dynamics models to align smart city initiatives with United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Wider co-benefits identified include improved public health through integrated green infrastructure and the reinforcement of social cohesion via participatory urban planning. This research concludes that embracing Complexity Theory enables a holistic approach to urban sustainability, fostering adaptable, resilient systems that can better manage uncertainty. This study highlights the need for interdisciplinary collaboration and innovative policy frameworks to navigate the multifaceted challenges of modern urbanization. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The prevalence of fires in modern urban landscapes continues to be reported as a significant challenge due to their potential negative consequences. This enduring threat heightened by climate changes necessitates the development of innovative approaches for early detection, incorporating a variety of sensor-based technologies across diverse scopes. Although effective, traditional detection methods based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or camera sensors often encounter cost, scalability, and deployment limitations, particularly for vast areas to be covered. On the other hand, scalar sensors for threshold-based fire detection are limited to the context and require proper calibration for different scenarios. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing a novel approach that leverages a sensor-based decision tree model for fire and smoke detection using micro Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The core of this approach lies in developing an efficient, lightweight model suited for extreme edge devices, where performance and energy efficiency are critical. We validated our model using a public dataset, demonstrating its potential effectiveness in real-world scenarios. By providing a sensor-based solution that is both scalable and cost-effective, the proposed solution emerges as a promising tool for augmenting fire safety measures in urban and wildland areas.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart cities can generate a lot of useful data for analyzing behavior and infrastructures, helping with urban planning. However, the applications found are often limited to desktop viewing only, which can hinder or restrict data analysis. This work proposes an immersive data visualization of the population of medical centers to assist in the analysis and development of new strategies to deal with overcrowding situations. The prototype allows the visualization of crowd data located in places of interest on top of a 3D map. The user can view the number of people present at the location at the current stage of the simulation or over time. To test the prototype, data from an infectious disease simulator was used, called LODUS. The results showed that the application has potential for visualizing this type of data.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have significantly improved transportation quality by using applications capable of monitoring, managing, and improving the transportation system. However, the large number of devices required to provide data to ITS applications has become a challenge in recent years, particularly the high installation and maintenance costs made broad deployment impracticable. Despite several advances in smart city research and the internet of things (IoT), research on ITS is still in the early stages. In this sense, to improve data collection and maintenance strategies for ITS systems, this article proposes a virtual infrastructure model based on data reuse, mainly autonomous vehicle (AV) data, to support ITS applications. It presents design choices and challenges for deploying a virtual infrastructure based on Beyond 5G (B5G) communication and data reuse, followed by developing a proof of concept of an AV data acquisition system evaluated through simulation. The results show that the extra data collection module results in a 1.1% increase in total memory usage with direct sensor collection and a 2.6% increase with application performance management (APM) data collection on the reference hardware. This data reuse setup can significantly improve ITS data challenges with minimal impact on current technology stack on the Autonomous vehicles currently in circulation. © 2025 The Authors.

	abstract = {Microservices have become an important technology to enable the dynamic composition of large-scale self-adaptive systems. Although modern microservice ecosystems provide a variety of autonomous adaptation mechanisms, when focusing on the microservice itself, they can only account for changes in the sheer increase in workload volume. On the other hand, when workload patterns change, efficient treatment requires the intervention of DevOps experts to manually evolve the internal architecture of services. Given the need to quickly adapt systems to respond to changes, solely relying on DevOps to react to workload pattern changes becomes a bottleneck for future systems. To address this issue, we advance the concept of emergent microservices, that autonomously adapt and evolve their internal architectural composition to better handle changes in the pattern of incoming requests without human intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by exploring this novel concept in the context of a microservice-based Smart City platform.

	abstract = {When designing smart cities’ building blocks, mobility data plays a fundamental role in applications and services. However, mobility data usually comes with unrestricted location of its corresponding entities (e.g., citizens and vehicles) and poses privacy concerns, among them recovering the identity of those entities with linking attacks. Location Privacy Protection Mechanisms (LPPMs) based on anonymization, such as mix-zones, have been proposed to address the privacy of users’ identity. Once the data is protected, a comprehensive discussion about the trade-off between privacy and utility happens. However, issues still arise about the application of anonymized data to smart city development: what are the smart cities applications and services that can best leverage mobility data anonymized by mix-zones? To answer this question, we propose the Utility Analysis Framework of Anonymized Trajectories for Smart Cities-Application Domains (UAFAT). This characterization framework measures the utility through twelve metrics related to privacy, mobility, and social, including mix-zones performance metrics from anonymized trajectories produced by mix-zones. This framework aims to identify applications and services where the anonymized data will provide more or less utility in various aspects. The results evaluated with cabs and privacy cars datasets showed that further characterizing it by distortion level, UAFAT ranked the smart cities application domains that best leverage mobility data anonymized by mix-zones. Also, it identified which one of the four case studies of smart city applications had more utility. Additionally, different datasets present different behaviors in terms of utility. These insights can contribute significantly to the utility of both open and private data markets for smart cities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Internet of things (IoT)[1] applications are wide spreading, recently empowered by the dissemination of technologies like smart cities, autonomous vehicles, smart grids, industry 4.0, home automation, wearables, etc. On the other hand, the global warming and climate crisis demand urgent, bold actions toward energy-efficient (EE) technologies for telecommunication systems, which are responsible for a significant part of global energy consumption. To this end, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) appear as an important technology to improve the propagation channel gain at the expense of very little power expenditures, recognized as a key element in achieving green telecommunication systems. In this chapter, we focus on the EE uplink (UL) transmission of massive multiple-input multiple-output (M-MIMO) IoT systems aided by an RIS. We propose and evaluate different schemes to minimize the total UL transmit power by optimizing the transmit power of IoT devices, the RIS phase-shift element, and the combining matrix at the base station (BS). Particularly, we give special attention to manifold optimization techniques, which are well suited to the RIS phase-shifts optimization problem. Herein, we treat jointly via iterative alternating optimization (i-AO) approach the three optimization variables: RIS phase-shift vector; BS combining matrix, and unit terminal (UT) power allocation vector. Extensive numerical results are provided and discussed, revealing that the proposed conjugate gradient (CG) method based on Riemannian manifold (RM) with the zero-forcing (ZF) combining achieves the highest power savings, being able to reduce the UL transmit power by up to 89% under typical operation conditions scenarios in comparison with conventional systems without RIS. © 2025 by The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

	abstract = {Current technologies could potentially solve many of the urban problems in today’s cities. Many cities already possess cameras, drones, thermometers, pollution air gauges, and other sensors. However, most of these have been designated for use in individual domains within City Hall, creating a maze of individual data domains that cannot connect to each other. This jumble of domains and stakeholders prevents collaboration and transparency. Cities need an integrated system in which data and dashboards can be shared by city administrators to better deal with urban problems that involve several sectors and to improve oversight. This paper presents a model of an integrative system to manage classes of problems within one administrative municipal domain. Our model contains the cyber-physical system’s elements: the physical object, the sensors and electronic devices attached to it, a database of collected problems, code running on the devices or remotely, and the human. We tested the model by using it on the recurring problem of potholes in city streets. An AI model for identifying potholes was integrated into applications available to citizens and operators so that they can feed the municipal system with images and the locations of potholes using their cell phone camera. Preliminary results indicate that these sensors can detect potholes with an accuracy of 91% and 99%, depending on the detection equipment used. In addition, the dashboards provide the manager and the citizen with a transparent view of the problems’ progress and support for their correct address. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Smart cities can improve the quality of life of citizens by optimizing the utilization of resources. In an IoT-connected environment, people’s health can be constantly monitored, which can help identify medical problems before they become serious. However, overcrowded hospitals can lead to long waiting times for patients to receive treatment. The literature presents alternatives to address this problem by adjusting care capacity to demand. However, there is still a need for a solution that can adjust human resources in multiple healthcare settings, which is the reality of cities. This work introduces HealCity, a smart-city-focused model that can monitor patients’ use of healthcare settings and adapt the allocation of health professionals to meet their needs. HealCity uses vital signs (IoT) data in prediction techniques to anticipate when the demand for a given environment will exceed its capacity and suggests actions to allocate health professionals accordingly. Additionally, we introduce the concept of multilevel proactive human resources elasticity in smart cities, thus managing human resources at different levels of a smart city. An algorithm is also devised to automatically manage and identify the appropriate hospital for a possible future patient. Furthermore, some IoT deployment considerations are presented based on a hardware implementation for the proposed model. HealCity was evaluated with four hospital settings and obtained promising results: Compared to hospitals with rigid professional allocations, it reduced waiting time for care by up to 87.62%. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This work proposes a flexible and comprehensive Internet of Things (IoT) architecture designed for application on smart campuses to build their smart infrastructure and facilitate their transition to becoming smart. The concept of a smart campus is derived from the concept of a smart city, which was developed to demonstrate how urban areas were addressing their new and dynamic challenges by integrating technology and data-driven decision-making. Although the concept of the smart campus was initially conceived to study the smart city in a less complex setting, over time, both concepts have evolved into distinct areas of inquiry, exhibiting unique characteristics and impacts. In general, a smart campus is a university campus where information and communication technologies and IoT are applied to some or all the campus processes, thereby making these processes more efficient, cost-effective and environmentally sustainable for the institution, its members and the surrounding community. Additionally to presenting the proposal for a flexible and comprehensive architecture for a smart campus, this paper also demonstrates its interpretation for implementation on a Brazilian campus transitioning to become smart, the Institute of Science and Technology, Sorocaba (ICTS) - campus of the São Paulo State University (Unesp) in Sorocaba, Brazil. To the best of the authors' knowledge, there is a scarcity of existing works which address this level of detail when proposing an IoT architecture for a smart campus. The implementation of this architecture has demonstrated that it can be successfully deployed using only open-source technologies. Furthermore, it has been shown that anyone with access to the campus website can access most of the data collected and stored on the system.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Wi-SUN FAN (Wireless Smart Ubiquitous Network Field Area Network) standard is attracting great interest in various applications such as smart meters, smart cities and Internet of Things (IoT) devices due to the attractive features that the standard offers, such as multihop and mesh topologies, a relatively high data rate, frequency hopping, and interoperability between manufacturers. However, the process of connecting nodes in Wi-SUN FAN networks, which includes discovering, joining, and forming the network, has been shown to be slow, especially in multihop environments, which has motivated research and experimentation to analyze this process. In the existing literature, to measure network formation time, some authors have performed experiments with up to 100 devices, which is a costly and time-consuming methodology. Others have used simulation tools that are difficult to replicate, because little information is available about the methodology used or because they are proprietary. Despite these efforts, there is still a lack of information to adequately assess the formation time of Wi-SUN FAN networks, since the experimental tests reported in the literature are expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, alternatives such as computer simulation have been explored to speed up performance analysis in different scenarios. With this perspective, this paper is focused on the implementation of the Wi-SUN FAN network formation process using the Contiki-NG open source operating system and the Cooja simultor, where a functionality was added that makes it possible to efficiently analyze the network performance, thereby facilitating the implementation of new techniques to reduce network training time. The simulation tool was integrated into Contiki-NG and has been used to estimate the network formation times in various indoor environments. The correspondence between the experimental and numerical results obtained shows that our proposal is efficient to study the formation process of this type of networks. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Urban configurations have substantial impacts on lifestyles, behaviors, and people’s daily lives. Elaborating urban plans based on smart and sustainable initiatives is a challenging task as it encompasses numerous multidisciplinary premises due to the dynamics of the urban context. This research aims to conduct a systematic review of the literature in three axes: sustainable urban development, city master plans, and smart cities. From the portfolio of papers built, it was possible to map projects designed for sustainable urban development in order to verify the integration of these projects with city master plans, specifically for smart cities. The content analysis also sought to identify global regions that use robust models, their frameworks, and technologies for this purpose as a strategy to identify which research or frameworks can be replicated in the future, helping to develop city master plans for smart cities. Although some results were found, it was observed that there is a lack of studies integrating the topics of smart cities, sustainability, and city master plans in the same discussion. Few types of research involve the three themes or their full application, being mostly described in isolation. Thus, the originality of this study is filling this gap in the literature. © 2024 by the authors.},

Exploiting the disaggregation of LoRaWAN components, this paper focuses on the emulation of complex end-to-end architecture and infrastructures for smart city scenarios, leveraging on lightweight virtualization technology. The fundamental metrics to gain insights and evaluate the scaling complexity of the emulated scenario are defined. Then, the methodology is applied to use cases taken from a real LoRaWAN application in a smart city with hundreds of nodes. As a result, the proposed approach based on containers allows for the following: (i) deployments of functionalities on diverse distributed hosts; (ii) the use of the very same SW running on real nodes; (iii) the simple configuration and management of the emulation process; (iv) affordable costs. Both premise and cloud servers are considered as emulation platforms to evaluate the resource request and emulation cost of the proposed approach. For instance, emulating one hour of an entire LoRaWAN network with hundreds of nodes requires very affordable hardware that, if realized with a cloud-based computing platform, may cost less than USD 1. © 2024 by the authors.},

Several companies offering basic services still use analog meters. Regarding smart meter implementation in Peru, we find that only electricity companies are currently in the trial stage. And the most advanced implementation is using Power Line Communication (Wired Network). The water service is in the project stage and the gas service does not present information. We propose a module that takes a picture of the meter's counter, packages the data, and sends it over a LoRa Network to a Gateway. We implement a LoRa multi-packet protocol prototype for image transmission. The Multi-Packet protocol assigns bytes from the LoRa sub-packet to be the header of the packet, this header gives information to improve efficiency. Sending packets in batches improves energy consumption and time transmission because the sender does not have to wait for an ACK response. This work is the first step in a surveillance system, and gives information about image transmission using LoRa. © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {IoT networks are transitioning towards greener underlying technologies. In smart cities environments, while some devices are already sustainable with rechargeable batteries and energy harvesting hardware, many still rely on traditional non-sustainable components. This partial sustainable Internet of Things (IoT) network poses a research challenge, since the profile of sustainable nodes aims for neutral or self-powered operation, which may conflict with the energy-saving goals of traditional non-sustainable nodes. In this challenging scenario, it is essential to share Energy Information (EI), i.e. battery state-of-charge, among the nodes to efficiently manage energy resources. However, EI sharing is valuable data for attackers to perform energy-based attacks, exploiting the most vulnerable nodes in smart cities. To tackle these problems, this article presents the Dual Energy PROfile for interNet-of-thiNgs with Enhanced Security (DEPRONN-ES), which is a solution designed to support partially sustainable networks, i.e. traditional and sustainable nodes, and applies differential privacy to enhance data privacy levels of the EI sharing. The performed evaluation shows the proposed solution is able to reduce the success rate of attacks in 87% and its effectiveness in terms of consumed resources of the attacked node. Besides, DEPRONN-ES is able to support conflicting profiles to operate in distinct energy consumption levels. This framework utilized emulation of IoT devices and real data traces of indoor light intensity measurements provided by Columbia University as a harvesting source of the rechargeable batteries of sustainable nodes.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Federated learning (FL) and bioinspired computing (BIC), two distinct, yet complementary fields, have gained significant attention in the machine learning community due to their unique characteristics. FL enables decentralized machine learning by allowing models to be trained on data residing across multiple devices or servers without exchanging raw data, thus enhancing privacy and reducing communication overhead. Conversely, BIC draws inspiration from nature to develop robust and adaptive computational solutions for complex problems. This paper explores the state of the art in the integration of FL and BIC, introducing BIC techniques and discussing the motivations for their integration with FL. The convergence of these fields can lead to improved model accuracy, enhanced privacy, energy efficiency, and reduced communication overhead. This synergy addresses inherent challenges in FL, such as data heterogeneity and limited computational resources, and opens up new avenues for developing more efficient and autonomous learning systems. The integration of FL and BIC holds promise for various application domains, including healthcare, finance, and smart cities, where privacy-preserving and efficient computation is paramount. This survey provides a systematic review of the current research landscape, identifies key challenges and opportunities, and suggests future directions for the successful integration of FL and BIC. © 2024 by the authors.},

Utilizing data about road intersections, bike lanes, and bus stops, the proposed data-driven methodology integrates multiple urban infrastructure data and employs K-means clustering to identify distinct risk clusters within a city. The resulting clusters offer valuable information for targeted interventions and urban planning, supporting the development of safer cities for cyclists. This innovative approach, leveraging geospatial analytics and clustering techniques, provides a practical framework for city planners and policymakers to prioritize and implement measures for enhancing cyclist safety, for any urban area in the world. Experimental results for the city of Münster, Germany, are presented to support the validation of the proposed approach, highlighting how the achieved results could promote more sustainable smart cities.

	abstract = {As delivery companies continue to explore the use of drones, the need for efficient and safe operation in urban environments becomes increasingly critical. Market-wide versions of drone delivery services will necessarily spread many drones, especially in big cities. In this scenario, avoiding collisions with other drones or typical obstacles in urban spaces is fundamental. This paper proposes and evaluates, via simulation and analytical modeling, an aerial delivery service scenario and three autonomous geometric approaches for collision avoidance. We compare our approaches with three simple methods-DoNothing (not detouring), Random, and aviation-like Rightward-and two state-of-The-Art geometric approaches. Simulation experiments consider different fleet sizes with constant and Poisson drone arrival rates and drones randomly choosing one of different altitudes for the cruise flight. Contrary to our expectations, the Random and Rightward approaches increase the collisions compared with DoNothing, making the latter our baseline. Our approaches significantly reduce collisions in all experiments and deal with more drones within the detection radius, showing that collisions are more complex to avoid. Comparing the collision rate, successful trips, and the number of flying drones reveals that the efficiency in avoiding collisions reduces the number of successful trips by increasing the number of active drones. Regardless of the expected reduction in collisions, more altitudes do not eliminate them. These results indicate the need for more sophisticated approaches to reduce or eliminate collisions. The analytical modeling using Markov Chains corroborates the simulation results by shedding some light on and helping explain the simulation results.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The urbanization process took place in the 18th century, mainly due to the Industrial Revolution, consecutively attracting more and more people to cities in search of jobs and better living conditions. Given this aspect, the urbanization process was increasingly consolidated, as the population needed to live close to industries and manufacturers to move to their daily work. However, this process of accelerated urbanization resulted from numerous problems, and reflexes until the present moment. The UN (United Nations) in turn created 17 SDGs - Sustainable Development Goals, which constitute a set of 169 global goals, with a pact to improve the quality of life of the world’s population and improve the urbanization of cities around the world with a commitment signed until the year 2030. Therefore, this study broadly addresses the contextualization of development on the maturity models of the cities that currently make up the BRCIS (Brazil, Russia, China, India, and South Africa) being a block that makes up countries in ascension/developing, very important for the world ecosystem in many aspects. In this way, the current article aims to carry out a bibliographical/historical survey of existing models of city maturity.

To follow the RM principles, we analyze the usage of different deployment approaches, particularly the impact of using a container orchestrator on the application layer. After running performance tests on the different configurations, the container orchestrator usage led to enhanced distributed processing, lowering the latency, increasing flexibility, enhancing security, and providing cost-effectiveness and scalability. We introduce the implementation of a modern DSA, developed following state-of-the-art cloud patterns and compliant with the RM for the SB context. Furthermore, we have ensured the reproducibility of this implementation by making the initial tests and overall architecture code available in public repositories. The research follows the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology for elaborating each phase until we get the artifact (DSA) and, with this, contribute to the Knowledge Base. The architecture was properly tested, considering the performance as the principal test layer. This solution is tailored for application in domains of the Internet of Things (IoT), focusing on the SB and a case study involving the Laboratory of Distributed Systems and Concurrent Programming (LaSDPC) at Sao Paulo University. Moreover, its applicability extends to IoT domains like smart home, smart campus, smart city, and health-related applications. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.},

Central to the operational efficiency of these cities is the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This Systematic Literature Review addresses the critical question: How can AI be used in sustainable smart cities? Using Kitchenham’s guidelines, the review followed a three-step Planning, Conducting, and Reporting process. Through a comprehensive search in the databases ACM, IEEEXplore, Scopus, Science Direct, and Emerald, a total of 46 high-quality papers were identified. These papers were scrutinized to understand the AI services utilized in smart cities, the benefits, the challenges of implementation, and potential solutions to these challenges. Findings reveal that AI’s impact is multi-dimensional, affecting transportation, energy management, and citizen engagement, among other areas. However, several challenges remain, considering ethics and data management.

	abstract = {Ubiquitous sensing in smart cities is expected to be one of the key beneficiaries of the high bandwidth and low latency capabilities of 5G. However, current 5G deployments still have low population coverage, and are unlikely to reach global coverage of above 80% before 2028. This means that new smart city applications are likely to experience a combination of 4G and 5G, limiting their data-intensive capabilities. Thus, it is necessary to assess the ability of current 5G deployments to support emerging smart city applications, and how they perform in 5G environments. Existing performance evaluations focus either on the 5G core or use instantaneous speed tests, which do not effectively assess the suitability of 5G deployments for smart city applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation and analysis of real-world 5G network performance observed through the outcomes of a pilot smart city application, an innovative mobile 5G Internet of Things (IoT) solution to automatically identify and report road assets requiring maintenance. The pilot smart city application was deployed on 11 waste collection service trucks over a 6 month period (June 2022–Dec 2022). We undertook both application-specific and application independent network performance evaluation to assess the ability of the 5G deployment to support uninterrupted smart city services. Our analysis shows that while 5G is capable of supporting mobile video streaming applications, there are significant variations in network performance, which may make it unsuitable for applications that require higher data intensive or near real-time responsiveness. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The digital transformation process has significantly boosted the widespread adoption of telemedicine and the utilization of wearable devices for vital signs remote monitoring. However, implementing a system for continuous monitoring of the population's vital signs, with data being streamed from various locations within a smart city context, faces significant challenges. These challenges are related to bandwidth consumption, communication latency, and storage capacity due to the large volume of data. To overcome these challenges, a common practice consists in modeling an edge-fog-cloud layered architecture. The literature lacks software solutions capable of managing the simultaneous transmission of various vital signs data from geographically distributed individuals while maintaining the ability to generate health notifications promptly. In this context, we propose the VSAC (Vital Sign Adaptive Compressor) model, which combines lossy and lossless data compression algorithms in a layered architecture to support healthcare demands in a smart city. The main contribution is how we blend both strategies: we first use lossy compression to collect only valuable vital sign data for everyone, applying lossless algorithms afterwards to reduce the number of bytes before sending it to higher layers. We provide a real-time processing protocol that facilitates the collection of heterogeneous data distributed across different city regions. After executing a VSAC prototype, the results indicate that orchestrating the aforementioned two data compression algorithms is more efficient than conventional data reduction methods. In particular, we obtained gains of up to 42% when measuring the compression rate metric. © 2025},

Despite this alarming trend, there is a lack of dedicated applications to support individuals in their recovery from alcohol abuse. In light of this situation, the literature presents machine learning techniques that can be employed to identify and characterize urban areas with a high propensity for alcohol consumption in major cities. This study explores the utilization of Location-Based Social Networks (LBSN) to assess alcohol consumption habits in Tokyo and New York. Data from check-ins at bars and restaurants were collected, and through clustering methods, the study examined the drinking patterns of urban residents. The findings revealed that, while there were cultural variations in drinking behaviors between the two cities, users tended to consume more alcohol during weekends and nighttime. Furthermore, the research successfully pinpointed the regions most conducive to such consumption. © 2024, Brazilian Computing Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Smart cities and healthcare services have been gaining much attention in recent years, as the benefits offered by this field of research are significant and improve quality of life. Systems can proactively detect health problems by monitoring a person's vital signs and make automated decisions to prevent these problems from worsening. With this in mind, we highlight two essential requirements that smart city architectures should consider to achieve elevated quality of experience in the healthcare domain. The first is to process high-priority vital signs with short response times, so people with comorbidities can have health problems identified as soon as possible. The second is to employ scalability techniques to deal with high usage peaks resulting from people concentrating in specific city neighborhoods. This paper contributes to this field of research by proposing SmartVSO - a computational model of a hierarchic, scalable, tree-based, fog-cloud architecture that executes healthcare services with reduced response time for urgent vital signs. Fog computing is employed to reduce response times, and cloud computing is used to provide virtually infinite computing resources. Serverless computing is the main technology we consider for deploying and running healthcare services because this allows authorized companies to implement their own services in a distributed and pluggable approach, without recompiling the proposed modules and reducing scalability concerns for engineers. An experiment with 80,000 vital signs indicates that our solution processes 60% of the very critical ones in no more than 5.3 s, while an architecture without fog computing and without prioritization takes up to 231 min (around 3 h and 51 min) to process 60% of very critical vital signs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

As part of a partnership to develop smart cities applications, a prototype vehicle tracking system has been developed and evaluated. The algorithm records the geolocation of the vehicle every 30 seconds, which can lead to unnecessary coordinates being sent and the communication network being overloaded. The aim of this work is to develop an algorithm that is able to determine the location of a moving object based on its angular position. The proposed algorithm uses an inertial measurement unit sensor to determine the change of direction and is able to correctly determine the route even if a coordinate is lost. We conducted an experimental study comparing the periodic approach with angular position-based approach on a route of a public bus in the city of Toledo/PR. The results show that the angle-based algorithm reduces the number of transmitted coordinates by up to 30%. © 2024 IEEE.},

Urban roads are a crucial infrastructure highly demanded by citizens and organisations interested in their deployment, perfor-mance, and safety. Urban traffic signal control is an important and challenging real-world problem that aims to monitor and improve traffic congestion. The deployment of traffic signals for vehicles or pedestrians at an intersection is a complex activity that changes constantly, so it is necessary to establish rules to control the flow of vehicles and pedestrians.

	abstract = {Localization techniques play a fundamental role in various applications like in the development of smart cities, making the improvement of such technologies indispensable. In this context, radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting (FP)-based localization methods are attractive due to their lower implementation cost, lower energy consumption, and better performance in non-line-of-sight conditions compared to GPS. With this in mind, we propose an RF FP-based localization method using an irregular grid map generation strategy. The grid map segmentation procedure is based on the assumption that the RF measurements collected in a region carry information on how users are often spatially distributed. The algorithms employed in the irregular grid map generation are the farthest-first traversal and low-discrepancy R-sequence. Different irregular grid map generators are compared with each other and with the regular grid map. We evaluate the generators in two different scenarios: with measurements obtained through simulation with ns-3 and via a driving-test procedure in an urban area. Numerical results indicate that our proposed irregular generator presents a lower localization error in both scenarios and is the only one capable of meeting one of the accuracy requirements stated by the Federal Communications Commission that demands a localization error of up to 50 m in 80% of the emergency calls. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In smart cities, it is common practice to define a maximum length of stay for a given parking space to increase the space's rotativity and discourage the usage of individual transportation solutions. However, automatically determining individual car dwell times from images faces challenges, such as images collected from low-resolution cameras, lighting variations, and weather effects. In this work, we propose a method that combines two deep neural networks to compute the dwell time of each car in a parking lot. The proposed method first defines the parking space status between occupied and empty using a deep classification network. Then, it uses a Siamese network to check if the parked car is the same as the previous image. Using an experimental protocol that focuses on a cross-dataset scenario, we show that if a perfect classifier is used, the proposed system generates 75% of perfect dwell time predictions, where the predicted value matched exactly the time the car stayed parked. Nevertheless, our experiments show a drop in prediction quality when a real-world classifier is used to predict the parking space statuses, reaching 49% of perfect predictions, showing that the proposed Siamese network is promising but impacted by the quality of the classifier used at the beginning of the pipeline.  © 2024 IEEE.},

In this study, we investigate the existing strategic themes, thematic evolution structure, key challenges, and potential research opportunities associated with the IoT. For this study, we conduct a Bibliometric Performance and Network Analysis (BPNA), supplemented by an exhaustive Systematic Literature Review (SLR). Specifically, in BPNA, the software SciMAT is used to analyze 14,385 documents and 30,381 keywords in the Web of Science (WoS) database, which was released between 2002 and 2019. The results reveal that 31 clusters are classified according to their importance and development, and the conceptual structures of key clusters are presented, along with their performance analysis and the relationship with other subthemes. The thematic evolution structure describes the important cluster(s) over time. For the SLR, 23 documents are analyzed. The SLR reveals key challenges and limitations associated with the IoT. We expect the results will form the basis of future research and guide decision-making in the IoT and other supporting industries. © 2022 Chongqing University of Posts and Telecommunications},

	abstract = {The advancement of smart cities relies heavily on the efficiency and reliability of wireless network connectivity, enabling a wide range of applications and services. However, evaluating the quality of network connectivity for smart city applications is a complex task. It requires the consideration of multiple factors such as security, throughput and reliability, besides the proper analysis in terms of the financial cost to provide the infrastructure for these networks. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel metric for assessing the connectivity of wireless networks in smart cities, takes into account those multiple factors (security, throughput, reliability and cost). It aims to provide specific measurements for different types of networks, fostering a comprehensive evaluation of their connections. Furthermore, a global index is introduced to estimate the overall connectivity quality across the entire application, which is linked to the coverage provided by each network. By employing these metrics, valuable guidance can be obtained to evaluate and compare various network connections, supporting decision-making during the design and (re)deployment phases. The effectiveness of these metrics is validated through simulations and case studies, demonstrating their practical applicability and relevance.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Drones find several usages in the modern world, including smart agriculture, providing Internet connectivity, delivering goods, and entertainment. They also find applicability in smart cities, enabling or improving activities such as surveillance, city planning, disaster management, and traffic monitoring. The usefulness of drones stems from their ability to access difficult regions, but also from the possibility of customization by means of different sensors and actuators: depending on what kind of accessories they carry, drones can perform a number of different tasks, broadening their applicability. However, this potential can be hindered by a number of hurdles, including technical, regulatory or even social issues. This paper describes the work of the DroNit project, which aims to improve the applicability and efficacy of drones in the context of the activities of the Civil Defense Office of the city of Niterói, Brazil. We describe how the office currently uses drones and discuss the main issues they faced throughout the years. We also discuss other possible applications of drones that could help the work done by the Office and study what are the currently standing obstacles. Finally, we discuss technical solutions that are currently under development by the DroNit project and report on preliminary results. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Extreme Events have recently become a topic of interest mainly due to the impacts of climate change worldwide over the last years. Such events commonly have a severe impact on major cities. Especially in Brazilian cities, the combination of climate change and unplanned urban growth on steep slopes has led to floods and landslides that killed thousands of people over the past decade. Once an extreme event impacts a city, a series of emergency events (henceforth named e-events) are registered by the citizens (by calling the local emergency telephone number). These e-events may vary from a small flood to a large-scale landslide. Thus, it is a top priority for governments to respond to these e-events as fast and as efficiently as possible. The problem is that the number of e-events is usually larger than the number of people (and vehicles) to respond to them. Another challenge is that these vehicles have to cross an impacted city with major traffic jams. The routes have to consider real-time traffic data to avoid streets with heavy traffic. This article proposes an approach named IRONSTONE, which aims at collecting the topology of the city and real-time traffic data to generate optimized routes for teams to respond to e-events. The proposed approach was evaluated with real scenarios of the city of Niteroi and the results are promising. © 2003-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {When it comes to vehicle surveillance, the Smart Parking System is considered indispensable, and it is now making its mark in the parking management sector. The errors caused by manual entry of vehicle registration information are absolutely eliminated. The process is made absolutely smooth and safe by the Smart Parking System. This not only stores reliable vehicle registration data in the database, but it also verifies the vehicle at exit points automatically. The Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system is a crucial component of smart cities as it uses image processing and optical character recognition (OCR) technology to read vehicle number plates. ANPR enables traffic control and law enforcement through an automated, fast, reliable, and robust vehicle plate recognition system. This paper proposes an enhanced OCR-based plate detection approach that utilizes YOLOv3 deep learning model and an object-based dataset trained by convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect alphanumeric data from the identified license plate. The project will produce a Dataframe containing vehicle’s registration details, entry time, exit time, and fees for the total duration of parking. To boost accuracy, a blended algorithm for license plate detection and recognition is proposed and compared to current methodologies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

Such an architecture is proposed to allow dynamic insertion and removal of physical sensors, which incorporate some metadata to allow any EDU to dynamically adapt to new physical configurations. By combining a plug-and-play feature enabled by the use of custom Transducer Data Sheets (TEDS) inspired by the IEEE 1451 standard, the proposed architecture expects to reduce configuration and deployment times while reducing development costs, potentially improving emergency management systems in smart cities.  © 2023 IEEE.},

These human communities are affected by events, such as advertising, and traffic accidents, among others, daily. These events may affect communities differently, accordingly to each community's characteristics. This paper proposes an approach to assess the spatial-temporal influence these events exert on different geolocation-based social communities, thus contributing to planning actions focused on these communities. In addition, this paper contributes to a better understanding of people's and communities' behavior once their mobility patterns are analyzed. We carried out a case study using the Geolife dataset, a trajectory dataset, to accomplish the above contributions. Thus, using a clustering technique, dataset users were divided into communities based on their geolocation history. For each community identified, we evaluated the degree of influence of events in eleven places of good circulation on different days of the week. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Context: Modern Information Systems require the use of contemporary software systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems, Embedded Systems, and Smart Cities-based Systems, eventually built under the paradigm of the Internet of Things. These Contemporary Software Systems (CSS) add new challenges for their construction, maintainability, and evolution, including the involvement of many actors with the software project and the necessary management of dependencies among hardware/things, software systems, and people. Problem: These technological challenges jeopardize the final quality of modern information systems due to the lack of adequate mechanisms supporting the engineering of CSS. Solution: Continuous Experimentation (CE) deserves some investigation regarding its suitability to mitigate and reduce engineering CSS risks. IS Theory: This research is under the General Systems Theory and is consistent with the Systems Information challenges regarding building smart cities-based systems. Method: To undertake a Structured Literature Review (StLR) supported with snowballing to reveal CE’s empirical studies. Results: The StLR identified seven primary studies on CE adoption to support CSS building. Many studies are in the domain of embedded systems and CPS. Besides, the findings allowed us to conjecture a set of challenges and opportunities regarding using CE in CSS engineering. Conclusion: There are emergent technologies to support CE’s execution in the context of web-based systems. However, several challenges and gaps surround CE’s use for engineering CSS. Furthermore, the lack of software technologies, blueprints, or concrete guidance to promote CE in these software systems can motivate further investigations into its use in engineering the important parts of modern information systems. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {Internet of Drones (IoD) technologies are often associated with unique swarms of drones or individual drone applications. However, enabling the next generation of IoD relies on effectively integrating IoD and Terrestrial Networks (TNs). IoD, Vehicle Ad Hoc Networks(VANETs), Public Transportation Systems (PTNs), Cellular, and Internet of Things (IoT) can create a successful partnership to enhance networkissues such as energy consumption, resilience, and dependable applications. Furthermore, there could be no Internet of Drones (IoD)without reliable and efficient drone coordination in the airspace. This necessity makes IoD an architecture responsible for managing dronecommunication and mobility. The airspace organization is crucial in combining IoD and Terrestrial Networks in a smart city scenario, asintelligent drone positioning can promote and facilitate integration with networks on the ground. Given these challenges, this work discussesairspace organization, describes possible partnership ways between IoD and TNs, and highlights the potential and challenges in convergingIoD and Terrestrial Networks for the next generation of smart cities. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to discuss the importanceof the partnerships between IoD and Terrestrial Networks. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Context: Smart cities are the future in terms of good resource and people management practices. Several resources can be managed by smart cities, among them urban mobility and energy consumption stand out. Problem: The brightness of public roads consume energy resources, but they are not always necessary, as is the case with roads with no use. Thus, energy resources are wasted. This work aimed to explore the economy of energy resources by observing the flow of use of public roads. Solution: Sensors observe the roads, and the costs of the edges are sent to the fog that applies a graph algorithm to determine the paths that have movement and, thus, generate the reductions in energy consumption via switching off lamps or reducing their frequency. Information System Theory: Based on the General Systems Theory, the general system is mapped into independent systems: fog sensors (fog) and algorithm execution nodes (nodes with higher processing power). A general ecosystem is formulated making the information system based on the information generated by the observation of the sensors. Method: A simulated environment was proposed to obtain the representation of a region of interest. For this region, a graph approach based on Dijkstra was applied to consider the paths with the highest flow of accesses and, thus, propose energy consumption reductions. Results Summary: The results obtained point to a possibility of saving energy resources in the range of 60 to 79% depending on the type of lamps used, and the size of observed region. The results reinforce the need to explore intelligent resources for shared use resources management. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

The departure point of this work is the literature review developed by Tomor et al. (2019). Their review was updated and compared. We confirmed some challenges positioned by the literature on the indiscriminate use of citizen participation as both an intrinsic characteristic of governance and as an outcome of the collaboration (Meijer & Bolívar, 2015; Tomor et al., 2019). This lack of a common understanding of the level of citizen autonomy creates a confusion in the literature regarding the actual level of participation, which highlights a need for further research about citizen participation and collaboration in smart governance. © 2023 29th Annual Americas Conference on Information Systems, AMCIS 2023.

This is challenging for the city's infrastructure, where image-based applications require transmitting large volumes of data, necessitating complex network and hardware infrastructures to process the data. To address this issue in image-based parking space classification, we propose creating a robust ensemble of classifiers to serve as Teacher models. These Teacher models are distilled into lightweight and specialized Student models that can be deployed directly on edge devices. The knowledge is distilled to the Student models through pseudo-labeled samples generated by the Teacher model, which are utilized to fine-tune the Student models on the target scenario. Our results show that the Student models, with 26 times fewer parameters than the Teacher models, achieved an average accuracy of 96.6 % on the target test datasets, surpassing the Teacher models, which attained an average accuracy of 95.3 %.  © 2024 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The utilization of edge computing has proven beneficial to Smart City applications due to its low latency processing on servers located in close proximity or even on the edge device. On the other hand, cloud computing leverages centralized computing power, resulting in significant advantages. Applications employing deep learning models commonly use both cloud computing and edge computing. While edge computing excels in providing rapid response times, devices typically possess limited computational resources. Conversely, cloud computing offers substantial computational power but suffers from longer access latencies. The challenge arises when deep learning applications must address one of these constraints, leading to poor scalability when focusing solely on edge or cloud computing or selecting a fixed distribution model. In this context, this paper aims to demonstrate the adaptive distribution of load leveraging osmotic computing. This approach directly impacts the scalability of deep learning solutions, mitigating the limitations imposed by either edge or cloud computing, improving throughput by up to 29% with low latency variation.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the concept of smart cities has become increasingly important in the pursuit of sustainable development goals. In general, common urban challenges have been addressed through smart-city services, and new perspectives for more sustainable cities have emerged. To realize the full potential of such smart urban environments, geospatial approaches have been used as a focal point, offering a plethora of applications that contribute to a better understanding of urban challenges and innovation potentials. Nevertheless, although significant progress has been made, different problems may arise when the available technologies and resources are not understood or even when their potentialities are not properly capitalized. This article reviews the state of the art in the field, highlighting success cases and remaining challenges in exploiting geospatial data-driven strategies, particularly when leveraging geographic information systems, satellites, and distributed sensors to produce and process geospatial data and datasets in urban scenarios. Moreover, a more organized perspective of the area is provided in this article, as well as future development trends, supporting new research efforts in this area when empowering smart cities for a more sustainable future. © 2024 by the authors.},

However, these services yield massive and unrestricted mobility data of citizens that pose privacy concerns, among them recovering the identity of people with linking attacks. Although several privacy mechanisms have been proposed to solve anonymization problems, there are few studies about their behavior and analysis of the data quality anonymized by these techniques. This paper presents an anonymization quality framework for mix-zones enabling characterizing and evaluating the impacts of anonymization over time and space in mobility data. We conducted experiments with a cab mobility dataset and two positioning algorithms to explore one of the potentialities of the anonymization quality: elect mix-zones that do not consider the traffic but its operating requirements too. The results showed that the anonymization quality enabled the selection of mix-zones that yield data anonymization considering the quality, privacy, and utility analysis. This study is unique because it analyzes mix-zone coverage and quality metrics to observe the anonymization quality not found in the literature. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Currently, several initiatives have been proposed in order to offer solutions for intelligent university campus environments. It can be said that smart university campuses are a subdomain of the smart cities domain, with some similar problems, but with specificities. Recommender systems identify and suggest relevant information to the user, recognizing their potential interests through specialized algorithms and presenting resources that align with these interests. In the context of intelligent university campuses, recommender systems have been used to define which systems and technologies should be implemented. From this scenario, the objective of this article is to present a software architecture, called SmartC, structured in different services, to provide the essential infrastructure for the application of several recommender systems and a variety of types of items. The services and layers of the architecture were defined especially for intelligent university campuses and divided into three distinct sections: the access environment, the recommendations management environment and the persistence layer. The recommendation algorithms integrated to this architecture are considered hybrids, since they incorporate two types of filtering: content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. When users request new recommendations, the type of filtering will be switched, ensuring that new features are suggested with each system call and avoiding throttling. The developed prototype was evaluated from real item data and showed significant accuracy in the recommendation process. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Emotion recognition is the task of identifying and understanding human emotions from data. In the field of computer vision, there is a growing interest due to the wide range of possible applications in smart cities, health, marketing, and surveillance, among others. To date, several datasets have been proposed to allow techniques to be trained, validated, and finally deployed to production. However, these techniques have several limitations related to the construction of these datasets. In this work, we survey the datasets currently employed in state-of-the-art emotion recognition, to list and discuss their applicability and limitations in real-world scenarios. We propose experiments on the data to extract essential insights related to the provided visual information in each dataset and discuss how they impact the training and validation of techniques. We also investigate the presence of nonverbal cues in the datasets and propose experiments regarding their representativeness, visibility, and data quality. Among other discussions, we show that EMOTIC has more diverse context representations than CAER, however, with conflicting annotations. Finally, we discuss application scenarios and how techniques to approach them could leverage these datasets, suggesting approaches based on findings from these datasets to help guide future research and deployment. With this work we expect to provide a roadmap for upcoming research and experimentation in emotion recognition under real-world conditions. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, Blockchain has been widely used to store decentralized and secure transactions involving cryptocurrency, e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. However, Blockchain can also store other types of information besides monetary transactions. On the other hand, innovative solutions for smart cities are concerned with how services and information can be safely stored and shared. For this reason, smart city systems can benefit from using Blockchain to integrate their data and services. These smart solutions also demand consistency and standardization across the industry. However, this Blockchain integration varies according to its implementation. FIWARE, a framework of an open-source platform for smart solutions, adopts NGSI Standards (Context Information Management (CIM); NGSI-LD API: Tech. Rep., CIM and ETSI Industry Specification Group (ISG), 2020) to enable the integration of components and provides the basis for interoperability and portability among smart solutions. Unfortunately, FIWARE does not support any integration with Blockchain technology. Hence, this paper proposes a set of new components to allow FIWARE to be integrated with Blockchain technology. With these proposed components, it is possible to support Blockchain technology with smart city applications via the FIWARE platform. For instance, we have designed and implemented a FIWARE Blockchain adapter to submit/listen to transactions from/to FIWARE Context Broker to/from any Blockchain implementation without human intervention. In addition, we present a global post-pandemic vaccination case study to evaluate the proposed approach in the Smart City context. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The rapid urbanization of cities has given rise to numerous challenges related to essential services and emergency management. To address these complexities, smart city solutions have emerged, employing advanced technologies to automate and enhance service quality. In this context, wireless sensor networks and the Internet of Things offer promising solutions for monitoring and detecting emergencies in urban environments. However, urban emergency detection is a complex task that requires intelligent data processing and analysis. Many existing approaches utilize artificial intelligence techniques to improve accuracy. Moreover, the time-critical nature of emergency detection necessitates swift and reliable diagnosis to avoid potential economic losses and human risks. To achieve precise and timely detection, a system capable of collecting georeferenced data, analyzing it, and providing reliable diagnoses is essential. In this paper, we propose a novel urban multiple emergency detection system based on hierarchical, collaborative and configurable wireless sensor networks. The hierarchical and collaborative nature of the proposed networks ensures efficient data exchange between sensing units of different categories. Our contributions lie in the implementation of flexible and configurable functionalities, enabling accurate and energy-efficient urban emergency detection adaptable to the unique characteristics of each city or region where it is deployed.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Remote sensing-based target detection process is applied to spot the targeted objects in remote sensing images (RSIs). However, it is challenging to detect small-sized vehicles in RSIs. The current study designs a Chicken Swarm Optimization with Transfer Learning-Driven Vehicle Detection and Classification on Remote Sensing Imagery (CSOTL-VDCRS) technique to resolve these issues. The presented CSOTL-VDCRS technique employs the mask-region based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask RCNN) technique for the detection of the vehicles. Once the vehicles in the RSIs are detected, the next step is to classify them using the Fuzzy Wavelet Neural Network (FWNN) model. To enhance the performance of the proposed model in terms of vehicle detection, the CSO technique is used as a hyperparameter optimizer for the Mask RCNN technique. The proposed CSOTL-VDCRS technique was experimentally validated using the benchmark dataset, and the outcomes demonstrate its superior performance over other existing models. © 2023},

In healthcare specifically, these devices can aid in management tasks and improve the quality of life of patients in intensive care. However, securing medical IoT devices and its data is a crucial task. Not only do they handle Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and physiological information, but in some cases, disruption can affect a patient's treatment. Blockchain technologies applied in the healthcare context can provide privacy, immutability, decentralization, and easier access and sharing of medical data. Despite the emergence of applications aiming to solve security issues in the Healthcare IoT (HIoT) scenario using blockchain, there is still much to be addressed, mainly regarding throughput, storage of data, and efficient use of resources. This work proposes a blockchain-based storage architecture for HIoT, using a private network and distributed data storage to achieve integrity, accountability, and availability of medical data. © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Blockchain has become an important processing paradigm in recent years. The blockchain supports financial transactions and validates contracts, documents and data. However, the evolution of blockchain has become viable for many applications. The servers’ availability and reliability (dependence) are required in the data processing. The contract will only be signed if there are enough components to form the blockchain blocks. This paper analyses the dependency between project components that use blockchain. We present a model based on stochastic Petri net (SPN) for evaluating the dependency of the blockchain architecture. The Design of Experiments (DoE) method was used to analyse this model’s factors, seeking to know which ones had the higher impact on the system. The sensitivity analysis showed that the MongoDB component has a greater impact on the system dependency and the need to upgrade such a component. Also, for reliability, making component improvements is unnecessary if the system has fewer than 36,000 h of runtime. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

This exploratory study describes the effects of ICT governance practices and the use of Industry 4.0 technologies on the decision-making of technology managers in Brazilian cities considered smart in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, 39 municipalities were selected based on classifications of Brazilian smart cities, and data were collected through the electronic citizen service system and a survey application. It identified the use of the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) and the ICT Master Plan (PDTIC) as the cities' ICT governance practices. Regarding Industry 4.0 technologies, the use of business intelligence (BI), cloud computing (CC), and open data was verified. Furthermore, the need to develop a planning culture and the need for internal training of professionals in the face of new technological resources emerged. The results showed that ICT governance practices and Industry 4.0 technologies have positive effects if used holistically according to the alignment with the municipality's strategic objectives.

	abstract = {Recently, many researchers have tried to answer a question regarding smart cities: how to connect a wide variety of sensors and aggregate the data collected by different technologies related to the Internet of Things (IoT)? Those data are usually gathered and transmitted through WAN (Wide Area Network) or private MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) connections. However, since WAN based solutions present different resources in terms of data, size, coverage area, latency and capacity requirements, they become inefficient or even prohibitive regarding operating costs on smart city applications. An alternative is the use of SD-WAN (Software-Defined Wide Area Network), which combines hardware and software appliances or is software based only, consisting of the virtualization of WAN connections. The main characteristics of SD-WAN are: the ability to do dynamic path selection, facilitating data flow and increasing system resilience; the support to multiple connection types (ADSL, VDSL, FTTH, 3G/4G or 5G), enlarging the coverage area when compared with traditional WAN; the employment of a simple interface (easy to configure and manage); the capital and operation expenditure reduction; the increase of service agility and flexibility; the implementation of a centralized control and monitoring with lower costs. In this sense, this paper proposes an SD-WAN embedded white-label solution, of low cost and low energy consumption for commercial and academic use employing Ubuntu Linux, Floodlight SDN Controller, Open vSwitch and Raspberry Pi 3b. Then, the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters obtained by the proposed SD-WAN solution are measured and evaluated, through network emulation tests performed with the aid of Distributed Internet Traffic Generator (D-ITG), in order to verify the applicability in smart cities.  © 2023 IEEE.},

Rural school transport is a challenge, considering the size of Brazil, the great diversity of biomes and insufficient infrastructure. Collaboration between areas by interdisciplinarity articulates individual knowledge through the object and by transdisciplinarity requires developing new knowledge, based on an individual area, going beyond and extrapolating with different criteria. The “Transcolar Rural” intelligent transport system has been developed at the UFMG School of Engineering to plan and manage rural school transport by optimizing routes and costs. The system is used in 13 states in Brazil, 500 municipalities and manages the daily transport of more than 400 thousand students in rural areas. Reducing transportation costs allows resources to be reallocated to other educational activities. The project highlights Brazil's limited resources, recognized by the government, to meet the population's health, education and transport priorities. Transparent information helps managers make decisions and supervise citizens, allowing both parties to determine priorities for resource allocation. The Project demonstrates how interdisciplinarity is effective for complex problems. The project comprehensively addresses the challenges of transporting children in Brazil by integrating technology, exact sciences and applied social sciences. © IMCIC 2024. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The widespread adoption of 5G cellular technology will evolve as one of the major drivers for the growth of IoT-based applications. In this paper, we consider a Service Provider (SP) that launches a smart city service based on IoT data readings: in order to serve IoT data collected across different locations, the SP dynamically negotiates and rescales bandwidth and service functions. 5G network slicing functions are key to lease appropriate amount of resources over heterogeneous access technologies and different site types. Also, different infrastructure providers will charge slicing service depending on specific access technology supported across sites and IoT data collection patterns. We introduce a pricing mechanism based on Age of Information (AoI) to reduce the cost of SPs. It provides incentives for devices to smooth traffic by shifting part of the traffic load from highly congested and more expensive locations to lesser charged ones, while meeting QoS requirements of the IoT service. The proposed optimal pricing scheme comprises a two-stage decision process, where the SP determines the pricing of each location and devices schedule uploads of collected data based on the optimal uploading policy. Simulations show that the SP attains consistent cost reductions tuning the trade-off between slicing costs and the AoI of uploaded IoT data.  © 2002-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {When designing smart cities' building blocks, mobility data plays a fundamental role in applications and services. However, mobility data usually comes with unrestricted location of its corresponding entities (e.g., citizens and vehicles) and poses privacy concerns, among them recovering the identity of those entities with linking attacks. To address the privacy of users' identity, Location Privacy Protection Mechanisms (LPPMs) based on anonymization have been proposed, such as mix-zones. Once the data is protected, a comprehensive discussion about the trade-off between privacy and utility happens. However, issues still arise about the application of anonymized data to smart city development: what are the smart cities applications and services that can best leverage mobility data anonymized by mix-zones? To answer this question, we present a methodology that evaluates the utility in many aspects with metrics related to privacy, mobility, and anonymized trajectories produced by mix-zones. The results showed that the proposed methodology identifies application domains of smart cities in which anonymized data can have more or less utility. Additionally, different datasets present different behaviors in terms of utility. These insights can contribute significantly to the utility of both open and private data markets for smart cities.  © 2023 ACM.},

	abstract = {Smart city platforms provide several services to facilitate the development of applications. Such platforms typically manage several applications, deal with a large volume of data, and serve many devices and users that generate a high volume of requests. The large number of requests to handle and the complex operations to perform often cause overloads on the platform, degrading the quality of service provided to users and applications. In this context, monitoring the underlying computational infrastructure in which smart city platforms and applications are deployed and the platform operations is essential. The monitoring process can allow for examining fluctuations in the behavior of the platform’s components to detect performance degradation and overloads (including unforeseen ones), contribute to avoiding interruptions in the platform’s services, and increase its scalability to assimilate significant amounts of requests, devices, and users. This paper presents a strategy and architecture to enable the nonintrusive monitoring of operations on smart city platforms and their underlying infrastructure. The proposal covers monitoring at multiple levels and is based on the aspect-oriented programming (AOP) paradigm so that it is possible to monitor the platform’s operations without intervening in the platform’s implementation or generating coupling regarding monitoring. This paper presents the implementation of the monitoring architecture and its instantiation in the context of Smart Geo Layers (SGeoL), a platform that has been used in several real-world smart city applications. This paper also reports the results of computational experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed monitoring architecture for response time to requests, CPU usage, and RAM utilization. The obtained results show an evident increase in response time with the number of simultaneous requests and a significant correlation between the response time and the CPU utilization in the deployment of the monitoring architecture. © 2023, Brazilian Computing Society.

	abstract = {Digital twins (DTs) have become progressively more popular in contemporary years and may continue to get snowballing acceptance. This chapter uses the terminology Personal Health Devices (PHDs) as a simplification for the set of healthcare gadgets comprising on-body and in-body devices, i.e., wearables, injectables, implantable, ingestible, and other non-mainstream possibilities. The options for its use have increased because of the DT reframing as a living or non-living entity rather than an exact digital duplication of something tangible. In smart cities, the DT disrupts industrial processes while simultaneously extending health and well-being to drive the development of new healthcare services. A standardized DT design for health follows rules according to ISO/IEEE 11073 framework operating in a loop cycle, collecting data from personal health devices, analysing it, and delivering feedback to the stakeholder. It is possible to integrate not only X73-compliant PHDs but also non-compliant PHDs into the framework by attaching them to an X73 wrapper subsystem, as detailed in this chapter. It is also reported that a corresponding customizable mobile application has been built for any compatible device. Possible ecosystems and the X73 mobile applications must be experimented with to demonstrate the DT viability in smart societies’ well-being. In order to get insights into someone’s health and well-being and provide feedback to individuals and caregivers, promising outcomes and the prospective advantages of the proposed framework are given. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {CityZones is an online tool to support when computing risk zones in a city, which is performed by mathematically evaluating the emergency response capability of an urban area using real data. The tool allows users to define polygonal Areas of Interest (AoI) on a map, which are categorised into low, medium, and high-risk levels. As urban emergencies in general will typically demand the assistance of hospitals (to attend victims), firefighters (for rescue operations and damages reduction), policemen (to control and manage critical situations), and even metro stations (for evacuation), the risk zones within an AoI will be computed according to the distances to such existing infrastructure, which is extracted from the OpenStreetMap database. The coordinates of an AoI are defined at the client-side and submitted to a server as a regular or irregular polygon, which is then stored in a GeoJSON file along with the computed classifications for further processing according to a multi-tier pipeline. Adopting a configurable square-based mathematical model to compute distances and relative risk levels, the risk zones are computed on-demand and exported to CSV files to be used by any application, with an additional representation for web-based visualisation. Moreover, as a practical exploitation of the computed maps, the CityZones tool also suggests ideal positions for sensors-based Emergency Detection Units (EDUs) within an AoI according to the chosen positioning algorithm, assuming that the computed risk zones indicate how severe an undetected emergency would be. While the CityZones tool is not intended to provide a mitigation approach at all, since it does not have knowledge about current emergency situations, it stands as a valuable pre-mitigation tool to be used in the planning phase of emergency management in smart cities, bringing an important contribution for practical applications in this area. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Smart Cities currently utilize computational solutions to enhance the quality of life for their citizens. However, these systems can be complex to integrate as they are often isolated, heterogeneous, and maintained by distinct organizations at different activity levels. The System of System (SoS) concept is one way to promote interoperability. SoS is a collection of several isolated systems that act interoperably as part of a more extensive and intricate system, forming a cohesive and complex entity. Smart cities can benefit by using SoS to integrate services and develop new features. However, SoS has some limitations, such as increased costs, limited collaboration, and mistrust of shared data and functionalities. Blockchain technology can be used to establish a trusted decentralized controller entity through a consensus mechanism among network participants to overcome these challenges. Therefore, this paper presents an architecture that combines Blockchain with SoS theory to enable trusted interoperability among Smart Cities systems. Finally, we conduct a stress test to evaluate the proposed solution.  © 2023 IEEE.},

Solution: Faced with this problem, the objective is to build a Automatic License Plate Recognition system(ALPR) to control vehicles entering and leaving Universities. It is proposed to interoperate with camera systems in order to alert the competent authorities. Information systems theory: This work was conceived under the General Theory of Systems with regard to interoperate with already existing heterogeneous systems. Furthermore, as part of the theory of socio-technical systems, this approach aims to improve the performance of the organization, offering improvements in the productivity of the task due to the alerts of the offered approach. Method: This research is descriptive and its evaluation is done through proof of concept. Results: The artifact developed showed good performance, allowing to recognize license plates in surveillance cameras with 76.6% accuracy. Contributions and Impact in the area of information systems: Our main contribution is the artifact to detect vehicles. A secondary contribution is our dataset with Old and Mercosul Plaques versions. Such method impacts the three pilars from IS area: People, Process and Technology. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {In the smart cities context, using green roofs can contribute to making cities more resilient, mitigating effects in the urban thermal field, such as urban heat island. In addition, mesoscale models of weather forecasting can contribute to short-term decision-making by public managers. Thus, this work presents an analysis of the impact of green roofs in Chilean Mediterranean cities, with this modeling tool, on meteorological variables. These cities are considered small and medium-sized. The results shows that the green roof reduces the temperature in Talca by up 1.28 °C, while the coastal city of Concepción decreases up to 0.1 °C. The turbulent kinect energy also reduces with the presence of vegetated roof compared with conventional roofs, influencing in the dispersion of pollutants. In general, the intensive use of green roofs in clusters of small cities can act as moisture and heat suppliers due to the advection effect, thus contributing to mitigating heat island effects.  © 2023 IEEE.},

The current deployment of the 5G networks and the envisioned 6G cyber–physical systems would expand the possibilities for offering IoT applications, autonomous vehicles, and smart city services while imposing strong pressure on the physical infrastructure. In order to guarantee the strictest quality of service and quality of experience requirements for users, new architectures have been proposed in the literature for metropolitan optical networks, with a growing interest in the last five years. However, due to the proliferation of a dozen new architectures in the last years, many questions need to be investigated regarding the planning, implementation, and management of these architectures, before they could be considered for practical application. This work presents a comprehensive survey of the new proposed single-layer (purely optical) architectures for metropolitan optical networks. First, we discuss the structural organization of the new metro ecosystems. Second, the already established and novel architectures are presented, highlighting their characteristics and application. Third, we carry out a comparative analysis of these architectures to identify future technological trends. Finally, we have drawn outstanding research questions to help direct future research in the field. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In order to efficiently manage emergency situations in cities, it is crucial to have a well-distributed network of emergency response centres that can quickly initiate mitigation actions. Conversely, such infrastructure can also be leveraged when designing emergency management systems in smart cities. To enable this in any city, we have developed a risk classification system that uses open geospatial data to preprocess urban areas. For that, we exploited the previous concepts of Area of Interest (AoI) and Points of Interest (PoI), extending them to also incorporate the concept of Area of Mitigation (AoM) for any regular or irregular polygonal AoI, considerably enhancing the definition of risk perceptions in a city. Additionally, we have proposed a new algorithm that finds realistic positions for Event Detection Units (EDUs) based on the streets in a city, avoiding prohibited deployment areas, which was in fact a deficiency of previous algorithms for this problem. By potentially reducing the time required to detect and notify emergency events in more critical urban areas, we want to improve the performance of emergency management systems as a whole, bringing important contributions for smart city applications in this area.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is impacting several areas. Using sensors and actuators in different contexts, such as smart cities, industry 4.0, healthcare, and agriculture, creates new interactions that can only occur due to connecting devices. As IoT devices join the military domain, new problems arise, like security and authentication in unreliable networks. This article proposes a novel approach for continuous user authentication to improve wearable device security in the Internet of Battle Things (IoBT) context. The proposed approach uses a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to directly optimize the embedding using the triplet loss. The created embedding represents the authorized user gait as a n-dimensional vector and enables comparison with other users’ gait using a L2 distance corresponding to a measure of gait similarity. The proposed system achieves a 92.12% rank-1 accuracy on user identification and a 12.33% equal error rate for the user validation task.  © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

The global COVID-19 pandemic heightened this problem. In an increasingly connected environment, such as smart cities, people's health can be monitored, so scenarios requiring medical support can be identified beforehand. Looking at the literature, we did not find surveys that address smart cities' approaches to handling the pandemic landscape. Based on this background, we propose a systematic literature review discussing the following issues: involved players and their interactions, processing techniques to generate value for the population, smart city architectures to cover pandemic situations, and data standards and technologies applied in this context. We have studied 58 articles, answering research questions regarding the above-mentioned topics. As contributions, we add to the literature a state-of-The-Art vision regarding challenges, open issues, and trends in the combination of smart cities and their support for pandemic situations. © 2024 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

This study aims to bridge this knowledge gap by applying a novel assessment framework to a case study context and generating useful insights. To achieve this aim, the study evaluates the smartness levels of 27 Brazilian state capital cities through the indicators of productivity and innovation, livability and well-being, sustainability and accessibility, governance and planning, and connectivity and innovation. This urban smartness analysis is conducted through a smart city assessment framework that brings up three categories of smart city performance types—i.e., leading, following, and developing. The findings of the analysis revealed that the common characteristics of cities with leading smartness performance are having: (a) a strong innovation ecosystem; (b) Specific legislation for developing entrepreneurship; (c) Training opportunities for skilled labor; and (d) Conditions for knowledge-based development and digital transformation offerings and readiness. The analysis identified the smartest cities in Brazil as follows: Florianópolis, São Paulo, Vitória, Curitiba, Porto Alegre, Brasília, Belo Horizonte, Rio de Janeiro, and Cuiabá. This study offers insights from the application of a novel method in the Brazilian context for the local authorities to consider adopting for smart city performance and progress analyses and subsequently making necessary interventions to transform their smart city policy and practice to realize their desired goals. © 2023 by the authors.},

Such a runtime infrastructure must deal with the highly dynamic workload of the different applications, with simultaneous access from multiple users and sometimes working with many interconnected devices and systems. This scenario requires auto-scaling mechanisms that automatically and timely add or remove cloud resources in response to dynamic variations in workload. This paper introduces a decision-making mechanism that analyzes the monitored state of a smart city platform and its underlying infrastructure at runtime to decide whether auto-scaling is needed.

In this context, Information and Communication Technologies appear to improve sustainability solutions. Smart Mobility emerges as a dimension of the Smart City and includes technologies and applications that assist transport services. Among these services, the applications directed to the cyclist segment stand out. In our work, we present a review of bicycle applications, and we perform a comparative function analysis and their relationship with the factors that contribute to the practice of cycling filtering the most relevant functions. We aim to find the most attractive features for urban cyclists and the limitations of what is offered in the market. In addition, we will provide guidance to improve the development of cycling apps and the implementation of new features, collaborating with the development of new technologies and future research.  © 2023 IEEE.},

As an initiative that aims to improve the quality of citizens' lives by finding new solutions to deal with urban problems deriving from fast urbanization, Smart Cities' success depends on the involvement of society, the public sector, as well as private sector. However, to accelerate sustainable development, a quadruple-helix approach might be considered. Most publications on smart cities have been addressing government and civil society roles to generate innovations in urban areas. The role of academia and industry, the latter being the focus of this research, still requires new studies to shed light on the potential contributions of these groups of actors. The industry represents actors that, at the same time, can contribute to developing Smart Cities and being impacted by city changes, which reinforces they have a role in discussing Smart Cities.

Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) promises to transform manufacturing through Digital Twins while Industry 4.0 advances digitalization with Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), machine learning, big data, and cloud computing. Hence, achieving Ultra-low latency (ULL) is crucial for applications like robotic control. Although 5G powered by Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) have improved the network capacity and reduced the ULL constraints, challenges persist due to wireless signal unpredictability. To address these issues, this research proposes leveraging in-network applications to the network edge to implement ULL solutions for industrial and Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) applications. Furthermore, we propose the hardware-based P7 emulation environment to evaluate data plane applications' performance, feasibility, effectiveness, and impact.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Context: A portion of the users in the São Paulo Metro are people who have physical limitations and need the help of wheelchairs or other similar devices. In this way, the Metro stations have elevators that allow these users to move between the floors of the station. In order, for the elevator to be used, it is necessary for the user to call the operators of the stations, who, in turn, check if the user who is requesting access to the elevator fits the target audience. Problem: This type of request requires manual validation by station operators, causing interruptions in their work routines and delays in passenger travel. Solution: To implement and evaluate artificial intelligence methods for automatic detection of people in wheelchairs or other auxiliary devices. IS Theory: This project was idealized from the perspective of Customer Focus Theory. Method: The You Only Look Once (YOLOv5) neural network was implemented in the Mobility Aids database. Tests were performed considering the original and modified base, composed of a reduced number of images, aiming to assess whether the accuracy of the model remains even with reduced database data. Summary of Results: The results obtained show an average accuracy of more than 92% with the modified database. Contribution: The results corroborated our methodology and we will be able to test in Sao Paulo subway with real images. In a long term, It is expected that by automating such a task, operators will be less overloaded and passengers with reduced mobility will gain more autonomy. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT), like other network infrastructures, requires Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) to be protected against attacks. When deploying an IDS in IoT-based smart city environments, the balance between latency and node capacity must be considered, which justifies a distributed IDS with specific classifiers based on the location of the system processing nodes. This paper proposes a two-level classification technique for collaborative anomaly-based IDSs deployed on fog and edge nodes. A Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) is used in the lower layer classifier at the edge, while a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used in the upper layer classifier at the fog. Experimentation has demonstrated that the suggested IDS architecture outperforms previous solutions. For instance, in some scenarios, when comparing our proposal with Random Forest, the former obtained an accuracy equal to 99.1%, while the latter obtained 95.3%. Furthermore, our proposal can better select the most important network traffic features, reducing 76% of the data to be analyzed and improving privacy.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Effective assessments are essential for producing reliable results, which, in turn, facilitate a deeper understanding of the subject under investigation. For researchers in the field of Software Engineering (SE), robust assessment strategies play a pivotal role in advancing existing technologies and gauging the suitability of emerging ones. In today's interconnected world, characterized by the proliferation of smart cities, creating a comprehensive usability assessment plan for smart city applications has posed a unique challenge, primarily due to the multifaceted nature of this paradigm. Aims: The primary objective of this study is to develop and introduce a tool that aids evaluators, mainly novices in usability, in crafting a comprehensive usability assessment plan for smart city applications. This tool aims to encompass all essential elements necessary for a thorough evaluation of the usability of such applications. Method: The instrument is a checklist designed in conformity with experimental best practices and based on experts' experience in planning and conducting assessments. It was evaluated by experts in assessment planning and has been undergoing a case study of a middleware platform for smart city application development. Results: The use of the instrument aids in the planning of usability assessments of smart city applications, therefore contributing to adapting the usability assessment to the context of a smart city. Conclusions: Even though it is not possible to determine the success of the assessment by using the checklist on its planning, the instrument seeks to encompass the relevant usability points and guide the assessment toward the smart city aspect of the application.  © 2023 ACM.},

	abstract = {Urban areas worldwide are increasingly finding their way into the Smart Cities model. As an initiative that aims to enhance the quality of citizens’ lives through the implementation of clever solutions, the success of Smart Cities relies on the involvement of academia, the public and private sectors, as well as society itself. Therefore, the quadruple-helix approach is considered relevant when discussing Smart Cities approaches. However, the society participation becomes a key challenge for these initiatives. The role of this actor, and its representativeness, still requires new studies to shed light on the potential of its contributions. The citizen represents an actor that, at the same time, can contribute to developing Smart Cities and being impacted by city changes. In this early-stage research paper, the society is approached as the citizen engagement. The authors argue that the shortage of citizen engagement and decision-making representativeness are influenced by organization asymmetry. The concept of organization asymmetry concerns the disparity in organizational struc- tures among the actors within the quadruple helix approach. Notably, three of the key actors, namely universities, government, and businesses, are represented by formal and well-structured organizations, while the societal component of the model lacks an equivalent level of organization, consequently resulting in a loss of representative- ness. This characterization aligns with the established concept of information asym- metry. Thus, we advocate for an approach that incorporates citizens as a pivotal actor within Smart City development plans, to promote meaningful and inclusive citizen involvement. This short paper aims to discuss the role of citizen engagement in the development of Smart Cities, providing a theoretical basis for describing the construct of organizing asymmetry. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2023.},

	abstract = {The adoption of multi-sensor hardware units to detect different types of emergencies in complex scenarios such as Industry 4.0 and Smart Cities is a recent development trend, which have demanded research efforts to optimize the way these units are assembled, configured, and deployed. However, although their expected advantages, usual multi-sensors emergency-oriented approaches may be constrained by the tight association between physical sensor devices and the emergency detection process. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative approach to concurrently detect multiple emergencies exploiting the concept of soft-sensor modules, which are implemented on Emergency Detection Units (EDUs) as concurrent tasks along with a high-priority emergency alerting task. The soft-sensor concept defines physical sensors as ordinary input data streams, which will be processed according to the defined algorithms by each particular soft-sensor, allowing detection decisions to be performed on the edge. In order to support the practical exploitation of this concept, a formal specification based on Petri Nets is defined, modeling the concurrent operation of the tasks within an EDU. A proof of concept is also designed based on the affordable Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller, demonstrating how the proposed approach would behave when two soft-sensors are implemented in a typical detection unit.  © 2023 IEEE.},

With ever-growing big data, tremendous undiscovered knowledge can be mined to be transformed into useful applications. Machine learning algorithms are taking the lead to achieve various target applications with formulations such as classification, clustering, regression, prediction, and anomaly detection. Notably, attention has shifted from traditional machine learning algorithms to advanced algorithms, including deep learning, transfer learning, and data generation algorithms, to provide more accurate models. In recent years, there has been an increasing need for advanced security techniques and defense strategies to detect and prevent the IoT and CPS from being attacked. Research challenges and future directions are summarized. We hope that more researchers can conduct more studies on the IoT and on CPS. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has witnessed remarkable growth in recent years, fostered by its vast market potential and its wide-ranging application across numerous domains. Among them, IoT applications in Smart Cities have stood out, with a significant focus on the development of cyber-physical systems that play a crucial role in the early detection of critical situations and the implementation of prompt actions to avert potential disasters. However, in order for these solutions to become more resilient and reliable, it is necessary for such IoT devices to have the ability to react immediately and adapt to the heterogeneity and dynamism of the sensed environments. These characteristics can be achieved through over-the-air (OTA) update strategies, which can remotely update and modify the software and firmware of electronic devices through wireless communications, without the need for physical or manual intervention. In this context, this paper proposes an OTA approach for the flexible operation of emergency detection units in smart cities, which might promote the integration of new requirements for critical events monitoring through remote updates, achieving a high degree of deployment, automation, and runtime scalability. Principles of authenticity and nonrepudiation are also taken into consideration to ensure security and reliability during the update and operation processes of these units. The logical operation of such new IoT devices are described herein, as well as the performed evaluation procedures.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The concept of smart cities has gained relevance over the past few years. Public managers have been planning investments to turn their cities into smart cities. Maturity models can help managers to monitor the performance of urban indicators; however, these maturity models are not always capable of meeting their proposed goals. In this sense, this research aims to develop a maturity model that ranks the “smartness” of a city based on social and technological indicators. The Smart Cities Maturity Model (MMSC) variables were extracted from ISO’s 37153:2017, 37120:2018, 37107:2019. The MMSC is structured on a hybrid TOPSIS multicriteria decision-making method. In this paper, we modified TOPSIS and used it to generate a synthetic indicator, called smart index, that designates the level of maturity of a real city. For this change to be possible, we fixed some alternatives and changed the positive ideal and negative ideal solution. The methodology is proven to be very efficient in measuring the smart city maturity level, and it can be easily adapted for the upcoming ISOs. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Climate change is a global challenge, and the Brazilian Amazon Forest is a particular concern due to the possibility of reaching a tipping point that could amplify environmental crises. Despite many studies on the Amazon Forest, this research was conducted in Manaus, the capital of Amazonas state, to address five gaps, including the lack of local citizen consultation on urban environmental issues, Smart Cities, decarbonization, and disruptive technologies. This study holds significance for the academy community, government bodies, policymakers, and investors, as it offers novel insights into the Amazon region and proposes a model to engage citizens in Smart Cities. This model could also guide other municipalities aspiring for participatory sustainable development with a decarbonization focus, mitigating future risks, and protecting future generations. Basically, it is an explanatory and applied study that employs mixed methods, including literature, bibliometric and documentary reviews, two questionnaires, and descriptive statistical approaches, organized in four phases to reach the following goals: (a) provide information on the main challenges facing humanity, the Brazilian Amazon state, and the city of Manaus; (b) identify the best Smart City approaches for engaging citizens in solving urban problems; (c) contextualize and consult Manaus City Hall about the effectiveness of the Smart City project; (d) investigate the perceptions of citizens living in Manaus on the main city’s environmental problems, as well as their level of knowledge and interest on issues related to Smart Cities, decarbonization, and disruptive technologies; (e) propose a participatory Smart City model with recommendations. Among the result, the study found that the term “Smart City” dominates scholarly publications among nineteen urban-related terms, and the five main environmental problems in Manaus are an increase in stream pollution, garbage accumulation, insufficient urban afforestation, air pollution, and traffic congestion. Although citizens are willing to help, the majority lack knowledge on Smart City and Decarbonized City issues, but there is a considerable interest in training related to these issues, as well as disruptive technologies. It was found that Amsterdam, Melbourne, Montreal, San Francisco, Seoul, and Taipei all have a formal model to engage citizens in solving their urban problems. The main conclusion is that, after 6 years, the Smart City Project in Manaus is a political fallacy, as no model, especially with a citizen participatory approach, has been effectively adopted. In addition, after conducting a literature and documentary review and analyzing 25 benchmark Smart Cities, the P5 model and the Citizen Engagement Kit model are proposed with 120 approaches and guidelines for addressing the main environmental problems by including Manaus’ citizens in the Smart City and/or decarbonization journey. © 2023, da Silva.

	abstract = {The main objective of this study is to propose a cyber-physical system (CPS)-based person reidentification (P-ReID) framework for smart surveillance. The Internet of Things (IoT)-based interconnected vision sensors in smart cities are considered essential elements of a CPS, and contribute significantly to urban security. However, the reidentification of targeted persons using emerging edge AI techniques still faces certain challenges. To improve efficiency at the edge and overcome the traditional sensing of video cameras, we employed an AI-based P-ReID framework for CPS that is functional in IoT environments. In addition, we present dual attention dilated network (DADNet), which integrates an energy-efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) with a self-attention module to substantially improve the person matching probability. Furthermore, we applied dual feature fusion to intelligently integrate discriminative and robust features using early and late fusion strategies that allow DADNet to significantly consider the foreground and marginally utilize the background information. Furthermore, we impose diversity orthogonality regularization over several CNN layers, which boosts the performance of DADNet, resulting in an appropriate usage over IoT networks. A comprehensive set of ablation studies, comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches, and a time complexity analysis confirm the strength of our DADNet for reidentification tasks in AI-enabled IoT settings that are well suited for a CPS.  © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The control of water resources has become increasingly necessary due to population growth and climate questions. This control is so critical that it is related to the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs): SDG #6 is clean water and sanitation, which aims to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all people. This study addresses the application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) as a solution to water management problems in smart cities, highlighting the importance of the participatory construction of smart water meters (SWMs) as a potential solution to monitor water consumption. The design and implementation of SWM provides significant technical and social challenges, but promises to improve efficiency in water control and consumption. The objective of this study is to investigate SWMs, analyzed using the open design methodology to identify problems, questions, solutions and ideas in their implementation. We understand how SWMs can benefit water management and propose more effective and participatory solutions. The methodology adopted involves three stages: analysis of the case of Company X, selection of cases from the literature, and analysis with Open Design. Analysis is performed using Open Design artifacts to identify stakeholders, questions and problems, and solutions and ideas related to SWMs. As a result, it is possible to identify open problems and questions that need to consider a more participatory and inclusive approach in developing SWM solutions. The use of Open Design is promising and makes stakeholder engagement more effective in creating sustainable and affordable solutions. © 2024 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.},

	abstract = {A citizen-centric view is key to channeling technological affordances into the development of future cities in which improvements are made with the quality of citizens’ life in mind. This paper proposes City 5.0 as a new citizen-centric design paradigm for future cities, in which cities can be seen as markets connecting service providers with citizens as consumers. City 5.0 is dedicated to eliminating restrictions that citizens face when utilizing city services. Our design paradigm focuses on smart consumption and extends the technology-centric concept of smart city with a stronger view on citizens’ roadblocks to service usage. Through a series of design workshops, we conceptualized the City 5.0 paradigm and formalized it in a semi-formal model. The applicability of the model is demonstrated using the case of a telemedical service offered by a Spanish public healthcare service provider. The usefulness of the model is validated by qualitative interviews with public organizations involved in the development of technology-based city solutions. Our contribution lies in the advancement of citizen-centric analysis and the development of city solutions for both academic and professional communities. © 2023, The Author(s).},

Mainly because this new mobile technology offers massive connections in densely populated areas in smart cities, thus playing a crucial role for numerous subscribers anytime and anywhere. Indeed, all the most important infrastructure to promote a connected world is being related to next generation networks. Specifically, the small cells transmitters is one of the 5G technologies more relevant to provide more connections and to attend the high demand in smart cities. In this article, a smart small cell positioning is proposed in the context of a smart city. The work proposal aims to do this through the development of a hybrid clustering algorithm with meta-heuristic optimizations to serve users, with real data, of a region satisfying coverage criteria. Furthermore, the problem to be solved will be the best location of the small cells, with the minimization of attenuation between the base stations and its users. The possibilities of using multi-objective optimization algorithms based on bioinspired computing, such as Flower Pollination and Cuckoo Search, will be verified. It will also be analyzed by simulation which power values would allow the continuity of the service with emphasis on three 5G spectrums used around the world: 700 MHz, 2.3 GHz and 3.5 GHz. © 2023 Ferreira et al., All Rights Reserved},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a key technology to interconnect the real and digital worlds, enabling the development of smart cities and services. The timely collection of data is essential for IoT services. In scenarios such as agriculture, industry, transportation, public safety, and health, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) play a fundamental role in fulfilling this task. However, WSNs are commonly deployed in sensitive and remote environments, thus facing the challenge of jamming attacks. Therefore, these networks need to have the ability to detect such attacks and adopt countermeasures to guarantee connectivity and operation. In this work, we propose a novel clustering-based self-healing strategy to overcome jamming attacks, in which we denominate fairness cooperation with power allocation (FCPA). The proposed strategy, aware of the presence of the jammer, clusters the network and designates a cluster head that acts as a sink node to collect information from its cluster. Then, the most convenient routes to overcome the jamming are identified and the transmit power is adjusted to the minimum value required to guarantee the reliability of each link. Finally, through the weighted use of the relays, the lifetime of each subnetwork is extended. To show the impact of each capability of FCPA, we compare it with multiple benchmarks that only partially possess these capabilities. In the proposal evaluation, we consider a WSN composed of 64 static nodes distributed in a square area. Meanwhile, to assess the impact of the jamming attack, we consider seven different locations of the attacker. All experiments started with each node’s battery full and stopped after one of these batteries was depleted. In these scenarios, FCPA outperforms all other strategies by more than (Formula presented.) of the information transmitted, due to the efficient use of relay power, through the weighted balance of cooperative routes. On average, FCPA permits 967,961 kb of information transmitted and (Formula presented.) of residual energy, as energy efficiency, from all the analyzed scenarios. Additionally, the proposed clustering-based self-healing strategy adapts to the change of jammer location, outperforming the rest of the strategies in terms of information transmitted and energy efficiency in all evaluated scenarios. © 2023 by the authors.},

As a result of this, the term has been used in different circumstances and with different names and is associated with several conceptual variants. Thus, the novelty of this work is based on capturing this perception and comparing it with the definition of the smart city found in the scientific literature in order to identify similarities and cognitive gaps and refine the smart city concept—a still open knowledge gap. For this purpose, the Social Representation Theory was used, operationalized by the evocation of words technique. The study was carried out in Brazil, herein considered as a proxy for other emerging markets with regard to smart cities. The results indicated a highly technocentric view on the part of citizens about the smart city concept. In addition, citizens did not realize some dimensions of smart cities that are often addressed in the scientific literature, such as People, Citizen Participation and Culture. Finally, it was noticed that most of the existing scientific literature on the definition of the smart city comes from developed countries rather than the Global South—curiously, where the largest urban agglomerations with the biggest problems to be faced are located. Thus, research on the concept of smart cities in developing countries is necessary, which is one of the motivations for the development of this work. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The accelerated development of technologies within the Internet of Things landscape has led to an exponential boost in the volume of heterogeneous data generated by interconnected sensors, particularly in scenarios with multiple data sources as in smart cities. Transferring, processing, and storing a vast amount of sensed data poses significant challenges for Internet of Things systems. In this sense, data reduction techniques based on artificial intelligence have emerged as promising solutions to address these challenges, alleviating the burden on the required storage, bandwidth, and computational resources. This article proposes a framework that exploits the concept of data reduction to decrease the amount of heterogeneous data in certain applications. A machine learning model that predicts a distortion rate and its corresponding reduction rate of the imputed data is also proposed, which uses the predicted values to select, among many reduction techniques, the most suitable approach. To support such a decision, the model also considers the context of the data producer that dictates the class of reduction algorithm that is allowed to be applied to the input stream. The achieved results indicate that the Huffman algorithm performed better considering the reduction of time-series data, with significant potential applications for smart city scenarios. © 2024 by the authors.},

We highlight the incorporation of gradient matching loss and the significance of employing a depth inverse representation. Furthermore, our study underscores the expansive utility of such predictive models, not only in surveillance within smart city paradigms and public security but also in diverse domains such as agribusiness, education, and biomedical engineering. Leveraging datasets like MIX 5, MIX 6, and ADE20K, we elucidate the performance enhancement achieved by Transformer-based Neural Networks in dense prediction tasks. Through these findings, the potential for Transformer-based models in practical applications, respecting data protection norms like LGPD, becomes evident.

	abstract = {Computer vision has always been a hot field of research by contemporary scholars due to its wide range of applications. As an important branch of this field, the visual monitoring technology has shown superior vitality in the actual monitoring environment of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, when the monitoring environment is complex, once the target monitoring fails, the important information related to the target also disappears. At this time, if the existing monitoring method is used, the target cannot be monitored again. Moreover, the current filtering monitoring algorithm also has the problem of poor interpretability. Therefore, this article combines the relevant characteristics of human inertial thinking when dealing with such problems. First, our method screens the movement information of the target and introduces a fuzzy reasoning mechanism to infer the location area of the target through fuzzy thinking. Then, an alternative selection strategy based on the thinking set is applied, which alternates between the location of thinking reasoning and the location of memory to further obtain the effective visual monitoring of the target. The filtering and monitoring algorithm fused with the new mechanism in the OTB-2015 data set, the UVA123 data set, and the TC128 data set all show that the proposed fuzzy inference mechanism has good robustness and universality. Furthermore, our results confirm that it can not only ensure the monitoring speed and overall accuracy but also improve the stability of monitoring in the IoT-assisted monitoring environment, showing its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods. In addition, our results confirm that the integration of the proposed edge learning method with the IoT can be well applied to the construction of smart cities and future generation systems.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) will be part of last-mile 5G/6G networks and will support Internet of Things (IoT) and low latency services in Flying Edge Computing (FEC). UAVs will densely populate aerial space in smart cities, providing networking and computing to interactive and monitoring services to ground users. FEC is composed of one or a set of UAVs, can cover large areas, and assure the quick deployment of services in 5G/6G systems. FEC will cooperate or even replace edge computing services on the ground network in case of congestion/failure events. However, the efficient selection and orchestration of UAVs to provide Quality of Service (QoS) to mobile users on the ground space is still challenging. This paper proposes a mobility-aware FEC orchestration scheme, called FLYED. FLYED enables UAVs to provide FEC with mobility and QoS support on ground space. Simulation results show the impact and benefits of FLYED in providing QoS assurance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The air pollution caused by greenhouse gas emissions, particularly carbon dioxide (CO (Formula presented.)), is a significant environmental concern that impacts air quality and contributes to global warming. The transportation sector plays a pivotal role in this issue, being a major contributor to CO (Formula presented.) emissions. In light of this situation, this article proposes a methodology that utilizes a supervised learning algorithm to estimate CO (Formula presented.) emissions and compare vehicles fueled with ethanol and gasoline. Additionally, the solution adopts an online, unsupervised machine learning algorithm to identify data outliers and improve the confidence in the results. Furthermore, this work incorporates the concept of digital twins, using virtual models of vehicles to carry out more extensive pollution simulations and allowing the simulation of various types of vehicles and the modeling of realistic traffic scenarios. A supervised machine learning approach was adopted to infer emission data in the model, allowing more comprehensive and meaningful comparisons between real-world and simulated measurements. The performed analyses of pollution emissions for different speeds and sections of routes demonstrate that CO (Formula presented.) emissions from ethanol were significantly lower than those from gasoline, favoring more sustainable fuels even in combustion engine vehicles. Adopting cleaner fuels is perceived as crucial to mitigate the negative effects of climate change, with plant-based fuels like ethanol being crucial during the transition from fossil fuels to a more sustainable vehicular landscape. © 2024 by the authors.},

While there is growing literature on the topic, there is limited understanding of City 4.0. This communication piece aims to bring clarity to City 4.0 by elaborating it from three diverse but interrelated perspectives—namely, societal, environmental, and economic lenses or domains (also know as the triple bottom line approach)—and highlights the key City 4.0 themes—namely, circularity, adaptability, livability, accessibility, authenticity, and responsibility. The methodological approach includes a thorough appraisal of the current City 4.0 literature.

	abstract = {Embedded Systems (ES) are present in several domains like automotive, smart homes, smart cities, industry, and healthcare, to name but a few. ES brings new challenges to designing embedded software that requires a high level of abstraction and being aware of resource consumption, mainly on resource-constrained devices. Modern programming languages like JavaScript (JS) can help solve these issues. However, JS is an interpreted language that demands attention to develop applications considering the balance between performance and resource consumption. In this scenario, this paper introduces an architecture design that proposes to model software for embedded systems as event-driven applications. Our design combines traditional architectures traits of Time-triggered (TT) and Event-triggered (ET) into a framework named JSEVAsync, promoting a hybrid system that explores JavaScript's non-blocking concept as a development interface to structure the algorithms into asynchronous units. As a result, we aid the development of applications with high abstraction levels and better resource consumption. To validate it, we compare C- and JavaScript-based applications, analyze the source code (static code analysis) to extract software quality metrics, and explore the results from the energy consumption perspective. We found that writing code through JSEVAsync can be up to 21% more energy efficient than the traditional method and can improve design-time metrics.  © 2023 Owner/Author(s).},

EC architecture aims to introduce computing capabilities in the path between the user and the Cloud to execute tasks closer to where they are consumed, thus mitigating issues related to latency, context awareness, and mobility support. In this survey, we describe which are the leading technologies to support the deployment of EC infrastructure. Thereafter, we discuss the applications that can take advantage of EC and how they were proposed in the literature. Finally, after examining enabling technologies and related applications, we identify some open challenges to fully achieve the potential of EC, and also research opportunities on upcoming paradigms for service provisioning. This survey is a guide to comprehend the recent advances on the provisioning of mobile applications, as well as foresee the expected next stages of evolution for these applications. © 2023, Brazilian Computing Society.

Through the collection of data from social media and sensors spread throughout the city, it was possible to excel the delivery of public services and information nearly in real-time. For this, the communication and exchange of information has been essential. This chapter aims to analyze how a developing country city used platforms and technical features from Internet of Things and Big Data Analytics in their smart city communication strategies. A case study about Center of Operations Rio de Janeiro (COR), in Brazil, was carried. Literature review in Portuguese was conducted to provide references to build a set of platforms and technical features recommended for social communication in the digital age. This recommended set of platforms and technical features were used to perform a structured visit in the COR´s portal and analyze how this set appears or identify new ones and their uses. The results bring a list of 7 platforms and 18 technical features. We believe that these platforms and features should be taken into account for the design of public communication strategies of smart cities of developing countries. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2023.},

One of the main aspects that hamper the large-scale development of IoT-based systems is the lack of interoperability. IoT Platforms aim to solve this issue by providing a uniform interface to access data from heterogeneous sources. However, integrating new protocols and applications can impose additional overhead, hindering the platform's overall performance and scalability. This study provides an insight into the trade-off between interoperability and performance of IoT platforms. First, we present a qualitative analysis of three open-source platforms - FIWARE, ThingsBoard, and Konker - analyzing their interoperability features. Second, we conduct a performance evaluation emulating two IoT-based environments - smart cities and smart health - to understand each platform's scalability, response time, and computer resource usage. Finally, we analyze the possible trade-offs between interoperability features and scalability based on the qualitative and quantitative analysis. The results show that interoperability features do not have a direct impact on the performance of the platform. © 2022 IEEE.},

Faced with a wide range of information, the coexistence of multiple definitions, and differences between the theoretical concept and what is being carried out in the real world, it is recognized that entrepreneurs and public managers require more clarity regarding the essential attributes that need to be considered in the initiatives of a city that aims to be classified as smart. This study strives to identify and synthesize essential information, helping managers to define and develop projects and initiatives within the context of smart cities. Through a literature review, six widely cited and commonly used groups of indicators are selected, and the most frequent themes, indicators, and keywords are identified. The results are the essential elements founded and synthesized in a single visual scheme. Although this study has a practical purpose, it is also necessary to promote new policies focused on incentives for local initiatives to support and complement them due to the new decentralized and anthropocentric approach to smart sustainable cities. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {There is no consensus on what it means to be a Smart City. Nonetheless, many cities around the world are adopting Smart City initiatives; Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) seem to be the common denominator of all these initiatives. But smart cities should evolve not only in technology but also in sustainable development that supports life quality. Sustainability can be measured by goals provided by the UN and also by indexes such as ISO 37.120:2014. Life quality can be defined by indexes as well, such as the Human Development Index (HDI) or any of several Urban Quality of Life (UQoL) indexes. So an index that measures "smartness"of a city is by necessity quite complex. To get a better sense of the indicators (or themes) such an index should include, we analyzed five indexes: one index of sustainability, one of life quality and three indexes for smart cities. We compared these in terms of the indicators or themes they addressed and then we surveyed the websites of 35 smart city initiatives to see for each indicator / theme we identified how many smart city initiatives considered it. We found that the themes that appeared in the highest number of indexes were also most frequent in smart city initiatives of the cities studied, and also that cities are convergent with tackling the same problems of society nowadays. © by the International Institute of Informatics and Systemics.},

	abstract = {Robust, fault tolerant, and available systems are fundamental for the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) in critical domains, such as finance, health, and safety. The IoT infrastructure is often used to collect a large amount of data to meet the business demands of Smart Cities, Industry 4.0, and Smart Home, but there is a opportunity to use these data to intrinsically monitor an IoT system in an autonomous way. A Test Driven Development (TDD) approach for automatic module assessment for ESP32 and ESP8266 IoT development devices based on unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) is proposed to monitor IoT device status. A framework consisting of business drivers, non-functional requirements, engineering view, dynamic system evaluation, and recommendations phases is proposed to be used with the TDD development tool. The proposal is evaluated in academic and smart home study cases with 25 devices, consisting of 15 different firmware versions collected in one week, with a total of over 550,000 IoT status readings. The K-Means algorithm was applied to free memory available, internal temperature, and Wi-Fi level metrics to automatically monitor the IoT devices under development to identify device constraints violation and provide insights for monitoring frequency configuration of different firmware versions. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is the first TDD approach for IoT module automatic assessment which uses machine learning based on the real testbed data.

	abstract = {The term "Internet of Things" (IoT) was first used by Kevin Ashton in 1999 and originally refers to reading Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID) devices to track products. However, in 2015, the IEEE IoT working group defined the IoT as "an application domain integrating different technologic and social fields" (Minerva et al. 2015). Although generic, this definition refers to devices connected to the Internet that read and store environment data to automate tasks. More specifically, the IoT is an intelligent global network allowing: (1) interaction of devices capable of sensing, performing computation, and communicating with the Internet; (2) processing and information exchange between devices, data centers, and users; and (3) creating several intelligent systems (Zhang and Tao 2020). A CISCO report (Pepper 2019) estimates that by 2030 approximately 500 billion sensing devices will be connected to the Internet. These devices will be able to send data using IoT networks. The transferred data could be accounted for, evaluated, and distributed for processing using IoT services and applications. The IoT network supports different data formats and protocols and is always under evolution due to changes in people's daily lives. The main application scenarios of these devices include smart cities, transportation, agriculture, energy, industry, and health. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.

	abstract = {Due to the increasing location-aware devices, mobility traces datasets have become an essential source for smart cities planning. Given this scenario, we propose MobVis, a framework to characterize mobility traces through different metrics, allowing comparisons between different mobility traces in a simplified way. Furthermore, MobVis can extract and visualize spatial, temporal, and social aspects of mobility data through a Web interface. MobVis architecture has five main components: input data; data preparation; data processing and analysis to extract mobility metrics; visualization; and a web interface. To demonstrate the framework's process, we created a use case analyzing the characteristics of two distinct traces (Taxi and IoT-Objects). Then, through different metrics, we evaluated the data in two aspects: i) descriptive, through a set of graphics and quantitative data that enables characterizing each trace; and ii) comparative, presenting the main differences between the traces.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart Cities use a variety of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and databases to improve the efficiency and efficacy of city services. Security is one of the main topics of interest in this context. The increase in crime rates demands the development of new solutions for detecting possible violent situations. Video surveillance (CCTV) cameras can provide a large amount of valuable information contained in images which can be difficult to be analyzed by humans in an efficient form. Identifying and classifying weapons in such images is a challenging problem that can be driven by the application of Deep Learning techniques. Object detection algorithms, especially advanced Machine Learning ones, have demonstrated impressive results in a wide range of applications. However, they can fail in certain application scenarios. This work describes a novel proposal for knife detection in complex images. This is a challenging problem due to the multiple variabilities of these objects in scenes (i.e., changing shapes, sizes and illumination conditions, among others), which can negatively impact the performance of mentioned algorithms. Our approach analyzed the combination two super-resolution techniques (as a preprocessing stage) with one object detection network to effectively solve the considered problem. The results of our experiments show that the proposed methodology can produce better results when detecting small objects having reflecting surfaces (i.e., knives) in scenes. Moreover, the approach could be adapted for surveillance applications that need real-time detection of knives in places monitored by cameras. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has been a hot topic in both academia and industry for the last few years. There are many possible applications, in fields as smart cities, home automation, smart buildings, agriculture, automated metering, logistic, industrial automation, among others. Such a wide range of applications resulted in various technological solutions in order to enable Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications, in which we highlight those for wide area networks. In that sense, two widely used sub-GHz protocols for Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) communications are: Long Range (LoRa), using the upper layers defined by Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN); and IEEE 802.15.4g, using the upper layers defined by IPv6 over the Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode of IEEE 802.15.4e (6TiSCH). While LoRaWAN is a well-known and widespread protocol, 6TiSCH offers IPv6 connectivity to LPWA networks and is used in important standards such as Wireless Smart Ubiquitous Network (Wi-SUN). This paper aims at determining how well each protocol scales, analyzing different aspects such as packet loss, delay, and the maximum number of nodes per square area. In order to achieve such results, computer simulations are performed using open-source simulators. The obtained results demonstrate that the best scalability depends on which scenarios are considered. For scenarios with multiple gateways requiring low latency or low packet transmission rates, LoRaWAN demonstrates better results. However, in scenarios with high packet transmission rates and where the latency is not a major concern, 6TiSCH is more appropriate. Moreover, even in the best case, the latency associated with the LoRaWAN technology may be considerably smaller than associated with 6TiSCH. Such novelty results are obtained in a fair and realistic way and, noting that both technologies could be used to build LPWA networks, it can help system designers to decide between the two technologies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {RDF is being increasingly considered in a broad range of information management scenarios. Governments, large corporations, startups, and other organizations around the world are using RDF as a data model to represent and share knowledge. However, there is still a long evolutionary track with multiple challenges for RDF reaching the scale of the most recent Big Data intensive applications (e.g., Smart Cities, Sensor Networks, eHealth, Internet of Things). In this survey, we review the usage of NoSQL databases to the storage of large RDF graphs by rehearsing the latest surveys and expanding their findings by updating proposals and bringing light to aspects such as model mapping between RDF and NoSQL, triple indexing and partitioning, graph fragmentation and data caching. Moreover, we explain how the surveyed works extended the RDF capabilities so the datasets can benefit of the characteristics of scalability, schemaless data, and better overall performance of NoSQL databases. The survey summarizes the current state of art, discusses open problems, and proposes a Reference Architecture (RA). For the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey where the focus is solely on papers that use one or more NoSQL systems for the RDF persistence.  © 2020 IEEE.},

In law enforcement and security, detection of anomalous events has application in the identification of suspicious behaviors. This paper addresses such problem in public areas by monitoring surveillance videos. Our approach involves a convolutional neural network for spatial features extraction, followed by a time series classifier with a one-dimensional convolutional layer and an ensemble of stacked bidirectional recurrent networks. The proposed methodology selects a pre-trained convolutional architecture for the spatial feature and applies transfer learning to specialize this architecture in anomaly detection in surveillance videos. We performed the experiments on the UCSD Anomaly Detection Dataset and the CUHK Avenue Dataset for Abnormal Event Detection to compare our approach with other works. Our evaluation protocol uses the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve—AUC, the Equal Error Rate—EER, and the Area Under the Precision vs. Recall Curve—AUPRC. During the experiments, the model obtained AUC above 92 % and EER below 15 % , which are compatible with the current literature. © 2021, Brazilian Society for Automatics--SBA.},

This model of cities, as well as its dimensions, have great appeal in the technological application, as the main means of promoting smart services. However, it appears that the approach to the role of the citizen in the promotion of intelligence is neglected, leaving questions about the role of the citizen in Smart Cities. Thus, the present study aimed to identify the technological structures applied in Smart Healthcare, allowing us to identify the role of the citizen in the promotion of smarter health services. A systematic literature review was carried out using the Methodi Ordinatio, resulting in a portfolio composed of 26 articles with scientific relevance. From the content analysis, four main approaches were identified, as well as technologies and methods to address one of the biggest challenges of health technologies: data security and privacy.

	abstract = {Developing smart city applications typically faces challenges such as meeting several complex requirements, integrating heterogeneous data sources, and considering geographical information representing the real-world urban space. Smart city platforms have a key role in realizing these applications as they provide high-level services that can be (re)used by developers. Despite the existence of many platforms to support the development of smart city applications, most of them do not associate the offered services with geographical information, do not support performing semantic queries on the available data, and have limitations that may burden development tasks. This paper presents Smart Geo Layers (SGeoL), a platform for developing smart city applications. Besides integrating urban data with geographical information, SGeoL relies on an underlying middleware infrastructure and leverages it by including high-level abstractions for (i) context data management, (ii) integration of heterogeneous data, (iii) semantic support, (iv) data analysis and visualization, and (v) data security and privacy support. This paper also reports experiences on the real use of SGeoL and empirical results on the evaluation of its performance and scalability. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

Connected vehicles are employed for surveillance and management of road traffic, navigation assistance, etc., by inheriting different analytical and communication techniques. With the Social Internet of Things (SIoT), interogrowthperable and shared computing models are adopted by the connected vehicles to perform application-specific decisions. By considering the need for computation models in smart connected vehicle networks, this article introduces a shared adaptive computing model (SACM) for improving the reliability of vehicle control and traffic management. This computing model considers multiple features of the in-range vehicles in detecting traffic and providing guided solutions for reliable routing in a smart city environment. This computing model is aided by the conditional support vector machine (SVM) for differentiating the complexity of multiflow data processing from the neighboring vehicles. The physical and connectivity-based factors from the smart vehicle using SVM classification learning improve the decision reliability and reduce the computing time and complexity.  © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Many characteristics are associated with the development of smart cities (SC), including the use of technologies to cope with complex problems related to the high levels of urbanization in the cities, such as guaranteeing better mobility, environment, and a better quality of life to citizens. In this sense, SC frameworks include, in general, governance and citizen participation as an essential dimension to assess the development of SC, based on the perspective that all stakeholders should share and contribute to solutions and visions for the future of the cities. Considering monitoring as a critical strategy to assess the advancement of SC initiatives, many measurement frameworks were created by different types of institutions and with diverse purposes. In this context, this paper aims to identify how SC measurement frameworks include indicators related to smart governance and citizen participation. Based on previous studies that systematized SC measurement frameworks and their main characteristics, this paper identified the presence of governance and citizen participation indicators, including the classification of approaches addressed by frameworks in this dimension. The methodology is based on desktop research and comparative analysis of SC measurement frameworks. Among the study results, the authors highlighted the lack of transparency of the indicators proposed in the analyzed measurement frameworks and the presence of different concepts and approaches to measure smart governance and citizen participation in SC initiatives.  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {For centuries, emergencies have been a recurring situation in cities. Natural or human-induced emergency situations can cause infrastructural damages in cities, potentially resulting in injuries, death, and economic losses. In this context, the use of Internet of Things technologies can support more efficient detection of emergencies such as floods, landslides, fire, and terrorism, being possible to alert people and trigger mitigation actions on time. Therefore, this work proposes an IoT platform for the development of sensors-based emergencies detection units, comprising a hardware architecture and a Real Time Operating System based firmware. By combining the concept of Soft Sensors with the parallelism of tasks on multi-core microcontrolers, as well as taking into consideration low-cost and energy efficient demands, it is expected an improvement in the development of such units in smart cities.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) have provided new technologies to protect human life, speed up assistance, and improve traffic, to aid drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANET) are the fundamental elements in an ITS ecosystem. However, its characteristics make the system susceptible to numerous attacks, such as Denial of Service (DoS). In this paper, we proposed a security system based on intrusion detection called Detection of Anomalous Behaviour in Smart Conveyance Operations (DAMASCO). We used a statistical approach to detect anomalies in vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V). The anomaly detection module addresses the Medium Access Control (MAC) sublayer to assess the number of packages sent to identify potentially malicious nodes, block their activity, and maintain a reputation list. The algorithm calculates the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) to identify outliers and characteristics of DoS. Our experiments were performed in a simulated environment using a realistic urban mobility model. The results demonstrate that the proposed security system achieved a 3% false positive rate and no false negatives. © 2013 IEEE.},

Such a transformation towards sustainable smart cities is underpinned by two disruptive technologies: building information modelling (BIM) and internet of things (IoT). In this chapter, the authors present a review of studies that have focused on the identification of BIM and IoT technologies applicable to AEC industry processes, describing suitable strategies for data collection, storage and sharing, and fields of application. They also present data from two case studies that help us to understand how BIM can support better facilities management. From the literature, it was found that process improvements are a predominant research focus, reinforcing that successful BIM and IoT adoption goes beyond the acquisition of technology. The case studies revealed that a framework for prioritising areas is still needed for giving direction to researchers and practitioners concerning where to start the digital transition. © 2023 by IGI Global.

There is a problem in evaluating how they should be mapped as investments in a smart city. There is a gap in the governance of cities in the touching priority investment solutions that can assist in decision making in cities to make them smart and sustainable. Therefore, the objective of this article was to obtain information on studies carried out on technological applications combined with dimensions/driver mapping solutions to transform cities into smarter ones. The study used a bibliographic analysis based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) methodology and applying smart cities and technological applications as basic parameters. In this way, it is expected as a result that it will be possible with the use of technology to define priority investment drivers. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

	abstract = {In the last few years, visual sensors are deployed almost everywhere, generating a massive amount of surveillance video data in smart cities that can be inspected intelligently to recognize anomalous events. In this work, we present an efficient and robust framework to recognize anomalies from surveillance Big Video Data (BVD) using Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). Smart surveillance is an important application of AIoT and we propose a two-stream neural network in this direction. The first stream comprises instant anomaly detection that is functional over resource-constrained IoT devices, whereas second phase is a two-stream deep neural network allowing for detailed anomaly analysis, suited to be deployed as a cloud computing service. Firstly, a self-pruned fine-tuned lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) classifies the ongoing events as normal or anomalous in an AIoT environment. Upon anomaly detection, the edge device alerts the concerned departments and transmits the anomalous frames to cloud analysis center for their detailed evaluation in the second phase. The cloud analysis center resorts to the proposed two-stream network, modeled from the integration of spatiotemporal and optical flow features through the sequential frames. Fused features flow through a bi-directional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) layer, which classifies them into their respective anomaly classes, e.g., assault and abuse. We perform extensive experiments over benchmarks built on top of the UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 datasets to test the effectiveness of our framework. We report a 9.88% and 4.01% increase in accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art methods evaluated over the aforementioned datasets. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Art graffiti can be considered as a type of urban street art which is actually present in most cities worldwide. Many artists who began as street artists have successfully moved to mainstream art, including art galleries. In consequence, the artistic graffiti produced by these authors became valuable works which are part of the cultural heritage in cities. When understanding the economic value of these public art initiatives within the smart cities context, the preservation of artistic graffiti (mainly, against vandalism) becomes essential. This fact will make it possible for municipal governments and urban planners to implement such graffiti maintenance initiatives in the future. In this context, this paper describes a deep learning-based methodology to accurately detect urban graffiti in complex images. The different graffiti varieties (i.e., 3D, stencil or wildstyle, among others) and the multiple variabilities present in these artistic elements on street scenes (such as partial occlusions or their reduced size) make this object detection problem challenging. Our experimental results using different datasets endorse the effectiveness of this proposal. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Despite all the progress already made, the vast majority of solutions have not met the requirements of Applications' Runtime, Development, and Deployment when related to Scalability. Some studies point out that just 1 of 97 (1%) reported platforms reach this all this set of requirements at same time. This small number of platforms may be explained by some reasons: i) Big Data: The huge amount of processed and stored data with various data sources and data types, ii) Multi-domains: many domains involved (Economy, Traffic, Health, Security, Agronomy, etc.), iii) Multiple processing methods like Data Flow, Batch Processing, Services, and Microservices, and 4) High Distributed Degree: The use of multiple IoT and BigData tools combined with execution at various computational levels (Edge, Fog, Cloud) leads applications to present a high level of distribution. Aware of those great challenges, we propose Sapparchi, an integrated architectural model for Smart Cities applications that defines multi-processing levels (Edge, Fog, and Cloud). Also, it presents the Sapparchi middleware platform for developing, deploying, and running applications in the smart city environment with an osmotic multi-processing approach that scales applications from Cloud to Edge. Finally, an experimental evaluation exposes the main advantages of adopting Sapparchi.  © 2022 IEEE.},

At the same time, the popularization of devices with attached sensors has allowed the obtaining of a large volume of data with spatiotemporal information from different entities. In this sense, we are faced with a large volume of vehicular mobility traces being recorded. Those traces provide unprecedented opportunities to understand the dynamics of vehicular mobility and provide data-driven solutions. In this article, we give an overview of the main publicly available vehicular mobility traces; then, we present the main issues for preprocessing these traces. Also, we present the methods used to characterize and model mobility data. Finally, we review existing proposals that apply the hidden knowledge extracted from the mobility trace for vehicular networks. This article provides a survey on studies that use vehicular mobility traces and provides a guideline for the proposition of data-driven solutions in the domain of vehicular networks. Moreover, we discuss open research problems and give some directions to undertake them. © 2021 ACM.},

	abstract = {Vehicular Edge Computing (VEC), based on the Edge Computing motivation and fundamentals, is a promising technology supporting Intelligent Transport Systems services, smart city applications, and urban computing. VEC can provide and manage computational resources closer to vehicles and end-users, providing access to services at lower latency and meeting the minimum execution requirements for each service type. This survey describes VEC's concepts and technologies; we also present an overview of existing VEC architectures, discussing them and exemplifying them through layered designs. Besides, we describe the underlying vehicular communication in supporting resource allocation mechanisms. With the intent to overview the risks, breaches, and measures in VEC, we review related security approaches and methods. Finally, we conclude this survey work with an overview and study of VEC's main challenges. Unlike other surveys in which they are focused on content caching and data offloading, this work proposes a taxonomy based on the architectures in which VEC serves as the central element. VEC supports such architectures in capturing and disseminating data and resources to offer services aimed at a smart city through their aggregation and the allocation in a secure manner.  © 2021 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Many cities around the world have been looking for implementation of strategies and projects focused on smart cities development to move on. However, it does not happen instantly and without conflicts of interest. In fact, the main difficulties of a strategy emerge during the implementation phase, because cities present several limitations of governance, capabilities, financing tools and so on. An alternative to solve these issues refers to the creation of a dedicated organizational structure to lead the collaboration between stakeholders in this process of urban transformation. Despite their relevance, there are few studies addressing how these smart cities dedicated organizations are constituted and structured, what tools and mechanisms they use and what is their role in the development of different urban innovation ecosystems are still scarce, especially with evidence from developing countries. Therefore, this paper aims to (1) analyze the structure, tools, and mechanisms of smart city dedicated organizations around the world and (2) to characterize their role in the governance of smart city development. Multiple case studies were conducted based on the documental analysis of websites, reports and official documents and interviews with directors of six smart city dedicated organizations from European and Brazilian cities. From this study, we expect to contribute with propositions and insights on how to structure a new governance model for smart cities development in different contexts. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Due to the increasing urban development, it has become important for municipalities to permanently understand land use and ecological processes, and make cities smart and sustainable by implementing technological tools for land monitoring. An important problem is the absence of technologies that certify the quality of information for the creation of strategies. In this context, expressive volumes of data are used, requiring great effort to understand their structures, and then access information with the desired quality. This study are designed to provide an initial response to the need for mapping zones in the city of Itajaí (SC), Brazil. The solution proposes to aid object recognition employing object-based classifiers OneR, NaiveBayes, J48, IBk, and Hoeffding Tree algorithms used together with GeoDMA, and a first approach in the use of Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) and the YOLO algorithm. All this is to characterize vegetation zones, exposed soil zones, asphalt, and buildings within an urban and rural area. Through the implemented model for active identification of geospatial objects with similarity levels, it was possible to apply the data crossover after detecting the best classifier with accuracy (85%) and the kappa agreement coefficient (76%). The case study presents the dynamics of urban and rural expansion, where expressive volumes of data are obtained and submitted to different methods of cataloging and preparation to subsidize rapid control actions. Finally, the research describes a practical and systematic approach, evaluating the extraction of information to the recommendation of knowledge with greater scientific relevance. Allowing the methods presented to apply the calibration of values for each object, to achieve results with greater accuracy, which is proposed to help improve conservation and management decisions related to the zones within the city, leaving as a legacy the construction of a minimum technological infrastructure to support the decision. © 2022 by the authors.},

In this sense, social media can be an information extraction source for several tasks, such as traffic control. However, these data have to be well classified in order to ensure that only relevant information is used. Particularly in Portuguese-speaking countries, there are not many works with this approach. Thus, we designed a methodology to identify traffic information from social media using modern techniques for classification. In addition, we generated a dataset, by extracting and manually labeling tweets in Portuguese language, and used deep learning techniques to classify these messages with respect to the traffic domain. Finally, we perform experiments employing different combinations of deep learning architectures for representation and classification, obtaining results of more than 95% on average for accuracy and precision metrics. © 2022 IEEE.},

The objective of this exploratory research was to investigate the characteristics necessary to identify crisis events with social media, analyzing the aptitude of messages produced in three crisis events that hit cities in the southeastern region of Brazil. In total, 3,042 Twitter posts were analyzed based on three essential dimensions for event identification: semantic, temporal and geographic information. The results show that users actually write messages about urban floods in Brazilian cities. However, it is possible to observe differences in volume, agility and location properties posted in areas with different numbers of populations. In addition, most posts lack information. Naturally, this limits the automatic use of these messages. Before applying some automatic detection technique, managers can investigate the data that circulates in a certain region and employ strategies to improve the use of this data. © 2022, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

	abstract = {Urban traffic simulations are of great importance for smart cities research. However, city-scale simulators can be both process and memory-intensive, and hard to scale. To speed up these simulations and to allow the execution of larger scenarios, this work presents a set of optimizations based on two complementary approaches. The first is an approach inspired by SimPoint to estimate the results of new simulations using previous simulations. This technique consists of identifying and clustering recurring patterns during a simulation, and then using a representative (the centroid of the cluster) of the recurring patterns to reconstruct the remaining ones. On a dataset with 216 time series, our technique was able to estimate the original series (of the same simulation) with an average error of 6.38 × 10- 6. Using only the trips which include the centroids (50% of the total simulation), estimation of metrics such as average speed and percentage of street occupancy rate, presented errors of 1.2% and 30% respectively, with a speedup of 1.95 in execution time. The second approach works on a lower level. In this approach we explore alternative implementations to Erlang’s ETS tables, a central data structure used by the InterSCity simulator, and a current performance bottleneck. These optimizations yielded a speedup of approximately 1.28 when compared to the current version of the simulator. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

However, implementation and optimization require path-loss (PL) modeling to estimate network coverage and performance. In this context, the LoRaWAN radio channel is investigated for uplink and downlink in the 915-MHz band. Extensive measurement campaigns were conducted outdoors in suburban locations of Belém, specifically in the neighborhoods of Pedreira and Marco. Based on empirical results, PL models are developed for LoRaWAN communications in uplink and downlink are compared to widely used empirical models. In addition, coverage, shading regions, SNR analysis, and percentage received packets are based on real measurements. The results show that the proposed PL models are accurate, easy to implement, and applied in similar regions for LoRa network planning in suburban smart cities.  © 2014 IEEE.},

The present study aims to analyze the contributions of leadership, governance, and people to the development of smart cities. To achieve this objective, the methodology Methodi Ordinatio was used, and data was collected from Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science using the following keywords combinations: smart cities, smart governance, smart leadership, and smart people. The results of the analysis reveal the importance of people acting with intelligent practices, as well as the need to encourage leadership and governance strategies. If there is a link between these three pillars, with the intention of sustainable development aimed at the common good, the chances of institutionalizing smart cities are greater. The study's conclusions point to the need for interconnection between individuals, leaders, and governments for a city to develop intelligently, therefore, having identified the absence of a concept that encompasses the three dimensions, this article contributes to an expanded conceptualization of smart cities. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The management of IoT solutions is a complex task due to their inherent distribution and heterogeneity. IoT management approaches focus on devices and connectivity, thus lacking a comprehensive understanding of the different software, hardware, and communication components that comprise an IoT-based solution. This paper proposes a novel four-layer IoT Management Architecture (IoTManA) that encompasses various aspects of a distributed infrastructure for managing, controlling, and monitoring software, hardware, and communication components, as well as dataflows and data quality. Our architecture provides a cross-layer graph-based view of the end-to-end path between devices and the cloud. IoTManA has been implemented in a set of software components named IoT management system (IoTManS) and tested in two scenarios—Smart Agriculture and Smart Cities—showing that it can significantly contribute to harnessing the complexity of managing IoT solutions. The cross-layer graph-based modeling of IoTManA facilitates the implemented management system (IoTManS) to detect and identify root causes of typically distributed failures occurring in IoT solutions. We conducted a performance analysis of IoTManS focusing on two aspects—failure detection time and scalability—to demonstrate application scenarios and capabilities. The results show that IoTManS can detect and identify the root cause of failures in 806ms to 90,036ms depending on its operation mode, adapting to different IoT needs. Also, the IoTManS scalability is directly proportional to the scalability of the underlying IoT Platform, managing up to 5,000 components simultaneously. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {In the field of study on smart cities, mapping information using Internet of Things (IoT) sensing is necessary because it allows optimizing resources through the real-time integration of the consumer with the supplier. However, world IoT production capacity would have to increase by two orders of magnitude to allow a meaningful level of mapping that could be felt in our daily lives. There are several technological challenges related to increasing IoT production by two orders of magnitude, such as the energy impact we would need to deal with. This work aims to introduce the idea that part of these challenges could be solved by changing the traditional computational architecture to the so-called Neuromorphic, a computational architecture based on biological brains. The work consisted of an extensive literature review that analyzed data on the specifications of prototypes of Neuromorphic architecture devices that were published in scientific databases. As a result, it was shown that Neuromorphic devices could meet the requirements and solve some challenges related to the increase that the world needs in the production of IoT, without the need for long periods of technology development. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Among the innovative services provided by smart cities initiatives, emergencies management systems have stood out as a mean to prevent the occurrence of disasters in urban areas, detecting emergencies as soon as possible and triggering response actions. For that, such systems may rely on multiple emergencies detection units spread over a city, which will be used to detect abnormal situations and report them for further processing. Although the use of multi-sensors hardware units seems to be reasonable to detect a lot of emergency-related variables such as temperature, humidity, smoke, and toxic gases, cities may have different geographical zones concerning the potential negative impacts (risk) that an emergency may have until it is properly mitigated. Therefore, such risk associated to those zones should guide the deployment of emergencies detection units, but their computation is not straightforward and it may depend on different parameters. In this context, this paper proposes a mathematical model to compute mitigation zones in any city, taking as reference the availability of response centers retrieved from open geospatial databases, notably hospitals, fire departments, and police stations. An algorithm is defined to compute a critical index to each zone, which will be exploited to indicate the proportional number of detection units that should be allocated according to the total number of available units. Initial results for the city of Porto, Portugal, are presented, which are discussed when concerning the construction of practical emergencies management systems.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Analyzing surveillance videos is mandatory for the public and industrial security. Overwhelming growth in computer vision fields has been made to automate the surveillance system in terms of human activity recognition, such as behavior analysis and violence detection (VD). However, it is challenging to detect and analyze the violent scenes intelligently to fulfill the notion of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)-based surveillance buoyed by constrained resources to reduce computational power. To tackle this challenge, in this article, an artificial intelligence enabled IIoT-based framework with VD-Network (VD-Net) is proposed. First, the input video frames are passed to light-weight convolutional neural network model for important information collection including humans or suspicious objects such as knives/guns. Upon suspicious object detection, an alert is generated as an earlier VD in IIoT network while the information is shared with concern departments. Only the frames with objects are forwarded to cloud for detail investigation where features are extracted using convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM). The latter from ConvLSTM is propagated to gated recurrent unit for final VD. The conducted experiments and ablation study on the existing surveillance and nonsurveillance datasets empirically validate the effectiveness of the proposed VD-Net by improving 3.9% increase in the accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art VD methods.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the breakthroughs in capabilities of mobile and embedded devices which allows them to become part of our everyday lives, and the subsequent advent of fields such as Internet of Things, Smart Cities and Ambient Intelligence, the process of exploiting individual device functionalities to create complex services, known as service composition, gains more traction. However, to perform service composition in such dynamic environments, where availability of resources is far from uncertain, there are many challenges that must be overcome. The way the human brain works allows it to configure itself to perform specific tasks, just like a service composition arranges a set of services to achieve a goal, and is capable to adapt to changes in its environment, providing us with a great degree of resilience, something very valuable for dealing with dynamic environments. In this work, we propose a model whereby the various modules of the Cuāyōllōtl Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architecture (BICA), which will be in charge of managing the different devices of a pervasive system, are to be configured to create a workflow that employs only the required modules to achieve an objective, in a similar fashion to how conventional service composition approaches produce composite services. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

The successful delivery of products depends directly on the continuous cooperation of professionals with different skills. However, we noticed a specific resistance in carrying out continuous and automated software deliveries to hardware devices by professionals.

	abstract = {The provision of biometric surveillance systems in cities’ administration in Brazil is commonly delegated to private companies, where businesses supply facial recognition technologies (FRTs) to law enforcement entities. These public-private partnerships often manifest a lack of transparency, while counting on the legitimacy of the public administration to offer public services. These regulatory “grey-zones” affect smart city policies in Brazil, sidelining civil society and researchers, while narratives of efficiency push ahead the digitalisation of public services without proper safeguards. In Brazil, the collaborative work of civil society before the courts and government authorities has been the most successful path in halting FRTs in the area of public security, establishing strategic precedents that discursively focus on the “right to the city”. This paper aims to achieve three goals: 1) shed light on these governance grey zones in order to identify the particularities of public-private models employed in the Brazilian socio-economic context; 2) examine the Brazilian human rights’ organisations’ attitudes towards the use of FRTs; and 3) provide a set of resilient principles that must guide biometric surveillance policies at the city level. © 2023, Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society.

	abstract = {Emerging IoT applications with stringent requirements on latency and data processing have posed many challenges to cloud-centric platforms for Smart Cities. Recently, Fog Computing has been advocated as a promising approach to support such new applications and handle the increasing volume of IoT data and devices. The Fog Computing paradigm is characterized by a horizontal system-level architecture where devices close to end-users and IoT devices are used for processing, storage, and networking functions. Fog Computing platforms aim to facilitate the development of applications and systems for Smart Cities by providing services and abstractions designed to integrate data from IoT devices and various information systems deployed in the city. Despite the potential of the Fog Computing paradigm, the literature still lacks a broad, comprehensive overview of what has been investigated on the use of such paradigm in platforms for Smart Cities and open issues to be addressed in future research and development. In this paper, a systematic mapping study was performed and we present a comprehensive understanding of the use of the Fog Computing paradigm in Smart Cities platforms, providing an overview of the current state of research on this topic, and identifying important gaps in the existing approaches and promising research directions. © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Amidst the consequences of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, the overall trip decrease and public transport modal share contraction pose a critical dilemma towards urban mobility. Through a questionnaire in Brazilian capitals, the present article considered (1) the citizens’ safety perception of urban mobility and public transport before and during the pandemic, (2) an estimated perception of the post-pandemic, (3) perception of safety regarding both traditional and smart measures, and (4) the concern about data use and privacy. Findings indicated an increase in private cars (41%) and ride-sourcing services (442%) use and a decrease in public transport modes during the pandemic, with an expectation of a post-pandemic modal split following the same pattern. According to respondents, most measures implemented resumes to traditional individual ones, without a systemic approach or smart initiatives. About the latter, a contrasting result was obtained, where there is a high safety perception if implemented with a low security perception over data use and privacy. In this sense, operators, public authorities, city planners and users must observe systemic sanitary measures, regulatory laws and transparency over data use and privacy, democratic and inclusive decision-making processes to address urban vulnerabilities and ensure safe public transport during and after the pandemic. © 2023, Eduem - Editora da Universidade Estadual de Maringa.

	abstract = {Wireless visual sensor networks have been adopted in different contexts to provide visual information in a more flexible and distributed way, supporting the development of different innovative applications. Although visual data may be central for a considerable set of applications in areas such as Smart Cities, Industry 4.0, and Vehicular Networks, the actual visual data quality may be not easily determined since it may be associated with many factors that depend on the characteristics of the considered application scenario. This entails several aspects from the quality of captured images (sharpness, definition, resolution) to the characteristics of the networks such as employed hardware, power consumption, and networking efficiency. In order to better support quality analysis and performance comparisons among different wireless visual sensor networks, which could be valuable in many monitoring scenarios, this article surveys this area with special concern on assessment mechanisms and quality metrics. In this context, a novel classification approach is proposed to better categorize the diverse applicable metrics for quality assessment of visual monitoring procedures. Hence, this article yields a practical guide for analyzing different visual sensor network implementations, allowing fairer evaluations and comparisons among a variety of research works. Critical analysis are also performed regarding the relevance and usage of the proposed categories and identified quality metrics. Finally, promising open issues and research directions are discussed in order to guide new developments in this research field. © 2022 by the authors.},

As a result, DataFITS increased by 130% the number of road segments coverage and enhanced, by fusion process, around 35% of road overlapping data sources. We evaluate the traffic estimation of the 15 most correlated regions, where the fused data together with correlated areas resulted in the best traffic estimation accuracy by reaching up to 40% in some cases and 9% on average.  © 2022 IEEE.},

The simulation of our proposed model was performed on the software Dojot, which is an open platform for IoT modeling. It addressed a real situation, in a path that is usually used by ambulances to get to a reference hospital in the city of Campinas, Brazil.

Although it was closely related to industrial automation solutions, its concept was quickly associated with the necessities of smart cities, such as robust communication technologies and devices capable of collecting all kinds of data. Finally, from the cities to the houses, there was just one step, and, currently, the IoT is so naturally inserted into the day-to-day life of millions of people, that they do not even realize it. This work aims to present an overview of how the Internet of Things has migrated from industries to houses as well as the main applications and business models. We also show how this technology allows the interaction between the virtual and real-world and the security concerns that must be kept in mind. The Internet of Things created an unprecedented level of interaction between people, buildings, and cities through virtual environments, and, although the benefits it might have, people must also be aware of the new threats and how to avoid them. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques present powerful frameworks for optimizing traffic signal controllers that learn to respond to real-time traffic changes. Multiagent RL (MARL) techniques have been showing better results over centralized techniques (RL-based or not), where local intersection agents have partial observation of and control over the environment. Since in TSC the best decision does not depend only on local information, in the present paper we aim at increasing agents' views by using a hierarchical approach, where information is passed upwards, is then aggregated forming recommendations that are sent downwards. We divide the transportation network into regions, each controlled by a region agent; this is done at different hierarchical levels. The traffic signal controllers, located at the intersections, are the local agents at the hierarchy's bottom. Region agents can supervise intersection agents or other region agents. Evaluation of this approach in a synthetic traffic grid shows that the proposed hierarchical organization outperforms a fixed-time approach and an RL-based approach without hierarchy. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

	abstract = {Smart cities and regions have a strong focus on providing citizens and residents with a better quality of life. Relatedly, urban governance is seen as a key element in the development and management of cities and regions. In border regions, where the social, economic, and cultural dynamic is often distinct, developing cities and making them smart presents challenges that can be addressed by binational governance. This study aims to understand how binational governance works in a border region that is seeking to become smart. A qualitative and exploratory study was conducted as a single case on the Brazil-Argentina border program La Frontera. In-depth interviews and document analysis were carried out and subjected to content analysis. The research findings shed light on the internal and external actors, the political and institutional environment, and the factors influencing the binational governance establishment and functioning. A history of disputes between the countries still shapes the dynamic of the border, and the formulation of laws and public policies. Moreover, institutions and actors can influence the focus of governance, and organizations that seek to ensure cooperation and integration do not necessarily guarantee that their principles are practiced.  © 2022 ACM.},

This paper proposes a Super Learner ensemble application in two scenarios: To distinguish urban from domestic sounds, and detect abnormal samples in industrial machines. The Super Learner combines supervised classifiers to detect abnormal samples or determine a class of an event from spectral features extracted from original sounds. We study the impact on time processing and performance of varying the number of K-folds in the cross-validation step using the Environmental Sound Classification (ESC-50) and Malfunctioning Industrial Machine Investigation and Inspection (MIMII) datasets. The performance evaluation demonstrates that RF is the best classifier in the ESC-50 dataset and SVM in the MIMII dataset. However, the Super Learner reaches AUC and F1-Score values near the best algorithm in the majority of cases analyzed, representing the best tradeoff solution.  © 2022 IEEE.},

Applications of environmental monitoring, logistics, smart cities are examples of applications that benefit from advances in IoT. In the military context, IoT applications can support the decision-making process by delivering information collected directly from the battlefield to Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems. Taking the benefit of the installed IoT network in the battlefield, the use of the data collected by the IoT nodes is a way to improve resiliency and increase the survivability of networks, as well as to optimize the use of available resources. Towards improving the communication network present on the battlefield, this work presents a context-aware environmental monitoring system that uses real-time battlefield information to increase military networks’ resilience and survivability. The proposed approach is validated by a proof-of-concept experiment. The obtained results show that the implementation of this system can improve the communication process even when the network is exposed to unfavorable climatic factors. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The usage of 5G-enabled IoT devices is rising exponentially as humans tend to shift towards a more automated lifestyle. A significant amount of IoT devices is expected to join the network as IoT has allowed interconnection and transmission among global devices which has resulted in generation of enormous diverse data. There is a requirement for a real-time, latency-specific, and network efficient computing paradigm in 5G-enabled smart city infrastructure. Fog computing presents trustworthy solutions to tackle these issues by combining edge users. They store, control, communicate, configure, measure, and manage big data produced by IoT devices. In this survey, the authors have performed a comprehensive study on fog computing and have classified various such paradigms. The authors have performed an extensive evaluation of features, along with the algorithmic and architectural packages deployed in the framework. This survey covers various 5G-enabled Industrial IoT (I-IoT) application settings and unleashes various fog framework-based solutions for numerous real-world application challenges in sustainable smart city infrastructures. Numerous contributions of fog computing towards latency-sensitive applications like healthcare 4.0, smart conveyance, smart waste management, smart energy handling, etc. has also been discussed. Fog computing framework apart from the abilities, also inherits various security flaws from cloud computing paradigm, and these flaws needs to be rectified in the interest of the end user. This survey presents a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art literature schemes to preserve the integrity of data in sustainable smart city infrastructure.

	abstract = {Data obtained from sensors connected to wireless sensor networks must be stored and processed to enable environments such as smart cities. However, with the exponential growth in the number of devices at the edge of the network, it is necessary to implement robust techniques, capable of selecting reliable data sources and meeting low latency requirements, in order to serve critical applications. Thus, to overcome these challenges, this research work presents FOCUSeR, a method for ranking sensors. The method uses the evaluation of data as a criterion for the ranking, allowing us to identify occurrences of failures in sensors and anomalies in environments. In order to meet the requirements inherent to WSNs, the proposed method was developed to run in a fog computing environment, using online learning and constant updating over time to avoid effects such as time drift. The generated ranking lists are managed through distributed hash tables. To provide reliability to the experimental results, a real experimental environment was developed. Moreover, using this developed testbed, a dataset with labels was created, to support the evaluation of the method. In addition, four other real datasets were used, three of which were labeled through artificial fault injection. These datasets were labeled in a related work that focused on injecting artificial faults. The experimental results obtained demonstrate that the proposed approach can provide reliability in the use of sensor data, using low computational resources and reducing latency in the sensor selection process. Precision rates are approximately 98% and Accuracy rates are greater than 94% across all datasets. In addition, the analyses carried out show that the Accuracy has an increasing rate as the number of samples also increases. Results obtained in the failure data recovery also demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal in this resource. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

A well-distributed set of rain gauges is crucial for monitoring services in smart cities. However, those services should consider the uncertainties about the registers of rainfall impacts. In this paper, the authors present a case study of optimal rain gauge location based on an actual database of rainfall events with impacts on urban mobility in the city of Sao Paulo (Brazil). Design/methodology/approach: This paper presents a maximal covering location formulation and proposes a robustness analysis considering spatial location perturbations. Findings: In this case study, the robustness of the objective function is above 99.99%. The robustness for the number of covered demand points is 88.93%, and the frequency associated with every candidate is between 11.71% and 69.49%. Originality/value: Incorporating spatial uncertainties on coverage problems is essential to provide stakeholders more realistic supporting tools and to draw different possible scenarios. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

As most people now live in urban areas, cities are experiencing growing demands for more efficient and sustainable public services that may improve the perceived quality of life, specially with the anticipated impacts of climatic changes. In this already complex scenario with increasingly overcrowded urban areas, different types of emergency situations may happen anywhere and anytime, with unpredictable costs in human lives and economic losses. In order to cope with unexpected and potentially dangerous emergencies, smart cities initiatives have been developed in different cities, addressing multiple aspects of emergencies detection, alerting, and mitigation. In this context, this article surveys recent smart city solutions for crisis management, proposing definitions for emergencies-oriented systems and classifying them according to the employed technologies and provided services. Additionally, recent developments in the domains of Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence and Big Data are also highlighted when associated to the management of urban emergencies, potentially paving the way for new developments while classifying and organizing them according to different criteria. Finally, open research challenges will be identified, indicating promising trends and research directions for the coming years.  © 2013 IEEE.},

CNNs are today fundamental not only for autonomous vehicles, but also for Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cities or smart homes. Vendors are developing low-power, efficient, and low-cost dedicated accelerators to allow the execution of the computational-demanding CNNs even in embedded applications with strict power and cost budgets. Google's Coral Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) is one of the latest low power accelerators for CNNs. In this paper we investigate the reliability of TPUs to atmospheric neutrons, reporting experimental data equivalent to more than 30 million years of natural irradiation. We analyze the behavior of TPUs executing atomic operations (standard or depthwise convolutions) with increasing input sizes as well as eight CNN designs typical of embedded applications, including transfer learning and reduced data-set configurations. We found that, despite the high error rate, most neutrons-induced errors only slightly modify the convolution output and do not change the CNNs detection or classification. By reporting details about the fault model and error rate, we provide valuable information on how to evaluate and improve the reliability of CNNs executed on a TPU. © 2022 EDAA.},

The elaboration process was innovative as it used co-creation mechanisms to engage a group of institutions and people involved in the topic of digital transformation in cities. Based on a design policy approach, it featured design thinking activities, workshops, working groups, listening, and online public consultation. The result was the Brazilian Charter for Smart Cities, a document that presents an agenda to address digital transformation as an opportunity for sustainable urban development in Brazil. The strategy gives eight strategic goals addressed to different stakeholders. Furthermore, a collaborative network was formed that remains active and implements the strategic goals defined in the Charter. The experience illustrates the importance of establishing collaborative and participatory processes in formulating strategies and public policies. The challenge now is implementing the goals in Brazilian municipalities, which are highly diverse and unequal, and replicating this participatory model to formulate local smart city strategies.  © 2022 ACM.},

Therefore, redesigning value chains to bring social, economic, and environmental gains becomes of particular interest in alignment with a new model of a people-centric super-smart society. This paper aimed to outline a conceptual design of urban agriculture (UA) 5.0 by applying a three-phase methodology supported by data triangulation. A relationship between Industry 4.0, food system, and sustainable society was identified, encompassing many points of convergence between UA and Industry 4.0 (35) as well as Society 5.0 (43). As a result, this paper proposed UA 5.0 as a multifaceted concept that brings a new paradigm for systemic agriculture integrated in cities, considering six key dimensions for its development (spatial, social, technological, economic, sustainability, and systems integration). This exploratory study contributes to in-depth discussions, and new strategies among policy makers for building a more resilient urban food system as an embedded solution in smart cities. The results discussed also outline a basis for developing super smart food system industries by exploring each of the dimensions proposed in this paper. © 2022 International Journal of Mathematical, Engineering and Management Sciences.

This topic has been discussed with greater emphasis in conjunction with environmental issues, driven by changes in the most diverse fields provided by the recent post-pandemic scenario. However, due to traditional or inefficient waste management approaches, most trash bins placed in cities can be seen as overflowing. Therefore, a remote monitoring system is needed to alert the level of garbage in bins to the relevant authority for waste clearance. In this scenario, the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm plays a vital role in improving smart city applications by tracking and managing city processes. This paper implements a solution based on Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) and blockchain technologies to provide the required data available for increasing efficiency in solid waste collection. Finally, this paper provides an evaluation of the proposed architecture related to latency and throughput metrics. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved.},

Thus, the objective includes the study of the contribution of games and gamification in the design of smart cities, with a focus on urban improvements and socio-spatial inclusion of favelas. Thus, the methodology presents descriptive, qualitative, and quantitative research, starting with a bibliometric analysis on the terms favela, smart city, and gamification/gamification in the scientific productions of the Scopus database, identifying specificities, and thematic convergences. Establishing intersections and tangencies with the thematic tripod, we develop a survey of games (games, Serious Games and Games for Change) and applications that have the city and city management as the background. Through pre-established criteria, 11 games and applications are analyzed, culminating in the systematization of information such as the area, the objective, the level of interaction with the dimensions of smart cities, the existence of urban application, emergency, if it was applied or if it has potential for application in slums. The results illustrate that the theme has been little studied and has a lot of potential for its development; indicates that the approach to the dimensions of smart cities is still timid, but existing; those few games more than half of the games studied have already been applied in cities, however, only one in the context of slums, with the requalification of urban space; and that despite the previous finding, half of the games have the potential for application in Brazilian slums. A global perspective of the scientific literature can be provided by analyzing original primary information in the area, as well as existing publications, works, programs, and games. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, Krishna Kumar, Gaurav Saini, Duc Manh Nguyen, Narendra Kumar and Rachna Shah; individual chapters, the contributors.},

A topic that has been treated with great attention is the security of the data generated by the Internet of Things Devices (IoTDs) within the smart home. Methods and architectures for the scenario of smart homes have also been researched as smart homes become more popular. Since IoTDs generate sensitive data about the smart home environment, data security and privacy are key points for smart homes to continue getting popular. Blockchain is a technology that offers security and privacy naturally due to its decentralized aspects and the high level of interaction between the blockchain’s members and the manner that data is stored in hashed blocks. A smart contract is a computer code that runs inside the blockchain to provide authentication for the blockchain’s members. The combination of blockchain and smart contracts provides the management of smart devices in a manner that their data is handled securely and protected from unauthorized parties. A smart home network architecture based on blockchain and smart contracts is proposed to simplify the way to manage smart devices and assign security to their data. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {In the industry 4.0 era, the visualization and real-time automatic monitoring of smart cities supported by the Internet of Things is becoming increasingly important. The use of filtering algorithms in smart city monitoring is a feasible method for this purpose. However, maintaining fast and accurate monitoring in complex surveillance environments with restricted resources remains a major challenge. Since the cognitive theory in visual monitoring is difficult to realize in practice, efficient monitoring of complex environments is accordingly hard to be achieved. Moreover, current monitoring methods do not consider the particularities of the human cognitive system, so the remonitoring ability of the process/target is weak in case of monitoring failure by the monitoring system. To overcome these issues, this article proposes a novel human short-long cognitive memory mechanism for video surveillance in smart cities. In this mechanism, a memory with a high reliability target is used as a 'long-term memory,' whereas a memory with a low reliability target is used as a 'short-term memory.' During the monitoring process, the 'short-term memory' and 'long-term memory' alternation strategy is combined with the stored target appearance characteristics, ensuring that the original model in the memory will not be contaminated or mislaid by changes in the external environment (occlusion, fast motion, motion blur, and background clutter). Extensive simulations showcase that the algorithm proposed in this article not only improves the monitoring speed without hindering its real-time operation but also monitors and traces the monitored target accurately, ultimately improving the robustness of the detection in complex scenery, and enabling its application to IoT-assisted smart cities.  © 2014 IEEE.},

In the efforts of softening those problems, researchers, companies, and public agencies have been investing more and more in the Smart Cities concept to improve urban services and, consequently, increase the quality of life of the residents. Smart Cities emerge from joining two development urban streams: (i) the cities’ redefinition from Information Technology and communications perspective; and (ii) from understanding the city as a space for creativity and innovation. It is known that applications developed for Smart Cities can highly facilitate urban management, in addition to increasing the population’s quality of life. However, to achieve a maturity stage, many technical and scientific challenges have to be met before those applications can be widely used. These challenges span from collecting, storing, and processing to analyzing and visualizing large datasets.

	abstract = {People use smart transportation systems to move around in smart cities, producing a massive amount of valuable mobility data. Although this characteristic enables the development of many intelligent applications, it can expose users to privacy threats. Location privacy is an issue addressed in many mobility contexts, in which there is a privacy concern. Currently, there are some proposals to tackle this problem, and some questions naturally arise: Are these proposals suitable for a dynamic environment, such as smart mobility? What are the impacts of mobility on privacy? In this article, we answer these questions to explore location privacy in smart mobility considering open and online data, one of the fundamental pillars of smart city platforms. We have evidenced the hypothesis that mobility can impact privacy approaches of anonymization (mix zones) and obfuscation (GEO-I) in the context of smart mobility. For this, we performed experiments to characterize and find similarities in the statistical distributions extracted from two stay points metrics, which operate as substrates to build location privacy protection mechanisms. We use an accuracy metric to quantify the datasets' distributions that matched each other. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of seven real datasets of mono or multimodal mobility. The results showed that the stay point count metric reached 100% and 83.3% accuracy for coarse-grained (person and vehicle) and fine-grained (bus, taxi, and person) data. Additionally, we show a similarity between distributions for the same vehicle type for mono and multimodal datasets.

The most diverse types of companies, such as hospitals, banks, stock exchanges, educational institutions, and power generation industries use this network to efficiently operate their processes, which range from collecting, processing, storing, and sharing large amounts of digital information. As more digital information is collected and shared, protecting that information becomes even more essential for national security and economic stability. Information security is the ongoing effort to protect these networked systems and all data from unauthorized or harmful use. As an individual, we have a responsibility to protect our identity, our data, and our computing devices. At the corporate level, it is everyone’s responsibility to protect the company’s reputation, data, and customers. As a state, national security and the well-being of citizens are at stake. Therefore, consolidating data and privacy competencies, integrating available technologies, can contribute to the better implementation, operation, and maintenance of compliance and privacy programs in organizations. In addition to being up-to-date with new technologies, ensuring that information security management methods and infrastructure are essential for a free society that has its privacy rights guaranteed. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The bandwidth-hungry applications have urged the research community not only to optimize the communication entities and subsystem(s) but also to explore new spectrum(s) which can help to alleviate the spectrum crunch as well energy consumption challenge. Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) has proved to be a useful method to enhance the capacity of radio link systems in 4G and beyond networks. Similarly, Visible Light Communication (VLC) is considered to be an environmental-friendly complementing technology for 6G networks. In this work, we have investigated the suitability of flexible transmitters and receivers for MIMO-based Visible Light Communication System for next-generation-networks. We created a channel state information (CSI) matrix based on random, Exponential, Rayleigh, and Gaussian distribution. Our results show that the randomly generated CSI matrix without diagonal maximization yields the worst performance whereas if the CSI matrix follows Gaussian distribution, VLC based MIMO system executes the best performance in terms of bit error rate (BER) against signal to noise ratio (SNR). Based on our results, we introduced the concept of flexible transmitters and receivers which can orient themselves at the physical layer based on the feedback received from the channel. We further extend our investigations by considering a square network of MIMO transmitters and receivers. Simulation results show that as the number of transmitters increases, BER performance deteriorates for independent data streams.  © 2022 IEEE.},

In this article, we propose a novel edge-based AI-IoT integrated energy-efficient intelligent transport system for smart cities by using a distributed multi-agent system. An urban area is divided into multiple regions, and each region is sub-divided into a finite number of zones. At each zone an optimal number of RSUs are installed along with the edge computing devices. The MAS deployed at each RSU collects a huge volume of data from the various sensors, devices, and infrastructures. The edge computing device uses the collected raw data from the MAS to process, analyze, and predict. The predicted information will be shared with the neighborhood RSUs, vehicles, and cloud by using MAS with the help of IoT. The predicted information can be used by freight vehicles to maintain smooth and steady movement, which results in reduction in GHG emissions and energy consumption, and finally improves the freight vehicles' mileage by reducing traffic congestion in the urban areas. We have exhaustively carried out the simulation results and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed system.  © 2022 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Human activity recognition (HAR) essentially uses (past) sensor data or complex context information for inferring the activities a user performs in his daily tasks. HAR has been extensively studied using different paradigms, such as different reasoning mechanisms, including probabilistic, rule-based, statistical, logical reasoning, or the machine learning (ML) paradigm, to construct inference models to recognize or predict user activities. ML for HAR allows that activities can be recognized and even anticipated through the analysis of collected data from different sensors, with greater accuracy than the other paradigms. On the other hand, context-aware middlewares (CAMs) can efficiently integrate a large number of different devices and sensors. Moreover, they provide a programmable and auto-configurable infrastructure for streamline the design and construction of software solutions in scenarios where lots of sensors and data are their bases, such as ambient intelligence, smart cities, and e-health domains. In this way, the full integration of ML capabilities as services in CAMs can advance the development of software solutions in these domains when ML is necessary, specially for HAR, which is the basis for many scenarios in these domains. In this work, we present a survey for identifying the state-of-the-art in using ML for HAR in CAMs through a systematic literature review (SLR). In our SLR, we worked to answer four research questions: (i) what are the different types of context reasoners available in CAMs; (ii) what are the ML algorithms and methods used for generating models for context reasoning; (iii) which CAMs support data processing in real time; and (iv) what are the HAR scenarios usually tackled by the research works. In our analysis, we observed that, although ML offers viable approaches to construct inference models for HAR using different ML approaches, including batch learning, adaptive learning and data stream learning, there are yet some gaps and research challenges to be tackled, specially on the use of data stream learning considering concept drift on data, mechanisms for adapting the inference models, and further considering all of this as services in CAMs, specially for HAR. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

This article aims to analyze the contributions to comply with SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) and SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities) through the modernization of public lighting and the use of remote management, i.e., the application of a set of hardware and software that work with the lighting poles and aims, among other things, to remotely control the lamps, perform measurements such as voltage, power, and efficiency, in addition to paving the way for various applications aimed at the Internet of Things (IoT). In other words, the equipment, such as public lighting fixtures, that are already installed in large and small cities in Brazil could be modernized and remodeled, to assign new characteristics, integrating the entire system of a smart city and the equipment currently used to benefit the population as a whole. Thus, by modernizing the system, the objective of this work is to bring and boost countless benefits to the society and the electric company, which, through the use of this system, can eliminate an old deficiency present in charge systems by estimation, adopting a real-time consumption measurement system with more precision. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Aspects arising from the proposed architecture for 6G networks are evaluated, both in the context of technological and ethical challenges, mainly due to the use of IoB (Internet of Bodies) devices, that is, devices incorporated into the human body. The methodology used is exploratory and intends to discuss ideas and formulate hypotheses. It is considered necessary to borrow knowledge from anthropology, psychology, and the cognitive sciences, to assess the ethical issues arising from 6G technology, and so on. Therefore, in this context, the results obtained were qualitative, through scientific research in relevant and modern articles, which discuss this theme, extracted from high impact and relevant scientific databases. Comments are made by way of conclusion. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Internet of Drones (IoD) is an architecture that aims to enable different drones to share the same airspace. This architecture can help coordinate drone access to airspace in urban environments. Considering that the IoD is a dynamic network, it is possible to have scenarios in which drone traffic is sparse when, for instance, the network has isolated drones. In this case, the drones' communication range does not reach any other drone. Thus, store-carry-forward protocols may be suitable for maintaining network communication. Moreover, different networks can collaborate to fill these communication gaps. In this study, we explore the collaboration between IoD and Bus Networks. Our analysis shows that maintaining a hybrid communication between drones and buses can fill the gaps in the communication between drones. The main goal of this work is to present the IoDSCF - a store-carry-forward routing protocol for joint Bus Networks and the Internet of Drones (IoD). IoDSCF takes advantage of both networks to extend the communication reachability. Our results reveal that IoDSCF presents better results in the number of delivered packets and end-to-end delay than a solution based only on communication between drones. This is a promising strategy for data communication, mainly in smart cities.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This review scopes evidence on the use of social robots for older adults with depressive symptoms, in the scenario of smart cities, analyzing the age-related depression specificities, investigated contexts and intervention protocols' features. Design/methodology/approach: Studies retrieved from two major databases were selected against inclusion and exclusion criteria. Studies were included if used social robots, included older adults over 60, and reported depressive symptoms measurements, with any type of research design. Papers not published in English, published as an abstract or study protocol, or not peer-reviewed were excluded. Findings: 28 relevant studies were included, in which PARO was the most used robot. Most studies included very older adults with neurocognitive disorders living in long-term care facilities. The intervention protocols were heterogeneous regarding the duration, session duration and frequency. Only 35.6% of the studies had a control group. Finally, only 32.1% of the studies showed a significant improvement in depression symptoms. Originality/value: Despite the potential for using social robots in mental health interventions, in the scenario of smart cities, this review showed that their usefulness and effects in improving depressive symptoms in older adults have low internal and external validity. Future studies should consider factors as planning the intervention based on well-established supported therapies, characteristics and needs of the subjects, and the context in which the subjects are inserted. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Pedestrian detection is a critical problem in many areas, such as smart cities, surveillance, monitoring, autonomous driving, and robotics. AI-based methods have made tremendous progress in the field in the last few years, but good performance is limited to data that match the training datasets. We present a multi-camera 3D pedestrian detection method that does not need to be trained using data from the target scene. The core idea of our approach consists in formulating consistency in multiple views as a graph clique cover problem. We estimate pedestrian ground location on the image plane using a novel method based on human body poses and person’s bounding boxes from an off-the-shelf monocular detector. We then project these locations onto the ground plane and fuse them with a new formulation of a clique cover problem from graph theory. We propose a new vertex ordering strategy to define fusion priority based on both detection distance and vertex degree. We also propose an optional step for exploiting pedestrian appearance during fusion by using a domain-generalizable person re-identification model. Finally, we compute the final 3D ground coordinates of each detected pedestrian with a method based on keypoint triangulation. We evaluated the proposed approach on the challenging WILDTRACK and MultiviewX datasets. Our proposed method significantly outperformed state of the art in terms of generalizability. It obtained a MODA that was approximately 15% and 2% better than the best existing generalizable detection technique on WILDTRACK and MultiviewX, respectively. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

The technological paradigm of the Internet of Things (IoT) provides the potential to enable Smart Cities, which emphasize rational consumption and waste reduction. This work proposes a system to monitor and identify leakages on Water Distribution Networks (WDNs). The monitoring devices must operate in Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN), networks that enable low power consumption at the cost of limited data throughput. A case study WDN was created on a software environment for data collection in various operation scenarios, including leakages in different locations. The obtained data sets were analyzed through data inference techniques to identify separable classes or features. Then, a Deep Learning algorithm was used to estimate the probable location of leaks in the WDN. The results obtained in the proposed case study indicate that the Deep Learning approach is a viable methodology to identify and locate leakages, despite the limited data throughput from LPWAN technologies. © 2022 IEEE.},

Furthermore, these requirements can change dynamically, as well as the importance of data traffic flows in the service context. Addressing this dynamism is one of the greatest challenges in the management of conventional networks. For this and other reasons, new paradigms such as software-defined networking have emerged. SDN decouples network control from forwarding, allowing development of new applications for dynamic programming of the forwarding devices in a centralized way. The FLOWPRI-SDN Framework is proposed in this work as an application built on top of the Ryu controller for priority resource reservation. Finally, the Framework is applied to a Smart City scenario, where it is shown that there are benefits in its use. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Despite the recent evolution of HetVNETs, points related to security, data integrity and privacy are still open issues, since there is no standard to achieve trust among the network nodes. A promising approach to achieve trust is the usage of a reputation system, that monitors the behavior of network nodes to determine its trustworthiness. However, this de-termination is complex, because the uncertainty coming from the HetVNETs features, such as fast mobile nodes, self-organization, unstable communication links and frequently changing topology. Within this context, this paper presents a reputation system for HetVNETs, called TrustV, to perform a faster and reliable determination of network nodes trustworthiness based on game theory, as well as the long-term and short-term communication technologies of HetVNETs. The game theory approach allows TrustV to overcome the uncertain issues of HetVNETs, since the modeling of the cooperation as a game can identify selfish and malicious nodes during the time. The results suggest that the TrustV achieves a very high cooperation rate between vehicles at Het VNETs, even as it is capable to detect selfish and malicious nodes as well as black hole and grey hole attacks.  © 2022 IEEE.},

However, these services yield massive and unrestricted mobility data of citizens that pose privacy concerns, among them recovering the identity of citizens with linking attacks. Although several privacy mechanisms have been proposed to solve anonymization problems, there are few studies about their behavior and analysis of the data quality anonymized by these techniques. In this paper, we introduce the anonymization quality. For this, we propose analyzing the mix-zones metrics Amount of Cars on Mix-zone (ACM), Interval of Arrival Time between Cars on Mix-zones (ITM), and Activation Time of the Mix-zone (ATM) for characterizing and evaluating the impacts of anonymization quality over time and space in mobility data. The results showed that mix-zone metrics reflect anonymization behavior and can measure the anonymization quality over time. This insight can contribute significantly to building privacy proposes based on anonymization more effectively than based only on traffic flow. To our knowledge, this is the first work that uses mix-zones metrics analysis to observe the anonymization behavior in quality terms.  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning (ML) that focuses on the development of artificial intelligence. It is also often referred to by its acronym, DL (AI). This technique lays an emphasis on the use of big capacity, scalable models that are able to construct distributed representations depending on the input data set. This proposed illustrates the generalizability of these methods and the usage of them in a broad range of cyber security investigations that are peculiar to their environment. The neural network models have been continuously refined and extended during the whole of this research in order to achieve greater adaptability. The following is a list of the important contributions that this proposed makes, in order from most significant to least significant: Work is currently being done to create a comprehensive database for the identification of domain names that have been generated by a domain generation algorithm (DGA), as well as a one-of-a-kind architecture that will increase the overall effectiveness of DGA domain name detection. Both of these will help increase overall efficiency. The creation of a hybrid intrusion detection warning system that is founded on a deep neural network (DNN) and that has the capability to monitor network and host-level activities inside an Ethernet local area network (LAN) (LAN). The examination of information gathered from social media platforms, electronic mail (email), and uniform resource locators in order to design a unified, DL-based framework for the detection of spam and phishing (URL). The creation of a technique based on DL for the study of secure shell (SSH) traffic, the categorization of application network traffic, the classification of malicious traffic, and the detection of harmful traffic is being worked on. The name of the new framework that has been suggested, which is called ScaleMalNet, reflects how hybrid and scalable it is. In the first stage, the executables file is classified as malware or genuine by using static and dynamic analysis. In the second stage, the malicious executables le are grouped into corresponding malware families. This is a two-step process. For the aim of conducting investigations into Android ransomware and malware, an analogous hybrid DL framework is now in the process of being developed. This framework is better in its capacity to detect dangerous software and ransomware on Android when compared to the typical ML-based techniques that are presently in use. These approaches are already in widespread usage. The development of a framework for DNS-based botnet detection and DL-based network intrusion detection is now being worked on in the context of the Internet of things (IoT) and smart cities © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In surveillance systems, vast amounts of data are collected from different sources to monitor ongoing video activities. Usually, video data is passively captured by visual sensors and forwarded to the command center, without intelligent Edge functionalities to select essential video information and locally detect abnormal events therein. These shortcomings often seen in practical surveillance scenarios lead to a wastage of storage resources and make data management, retrieval, and informed decision complex and time-consuming. Therefore, endowing visual sensors with video summarization capabilities is of utmost importance for smarter surveillance systems. This study departs from this rationale to propose an efficient neural networks-based video summarization method for surveillance systems. The proposed approach learns how to optimally segment a video by measuring informative features from the data flow, followed by memorability and entropy to maintain the relevance and diversity of the video summary produced on the Edge. Experimental results over benchmark datasets reveal that the proposed scheme outperforms other state-of-the-art counterparts and proves the effectiveness of our method for video summarization in smart cities. © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are employed for several purposes such as delivering products, spreading pesticides on crops, providing internet access to remote areas, and taking videos and photos for entertainment. In the context of smart cities it is not different. Some cities have adopted drones for a number of important tasks, such as surveillance, traffic monitoring, and disaster management. Indeed, their ability of reaching difficult places and the possibility of carrying different sensors and actuators make those devices very flexible tools that can adapt to several use cases. Nevertheless, there are still obstacles — technical, regulatory or even social — that can hinder the applicability of drones to certain tasks. In this work, we report and analyze the use of drones by the Civil Defense Office of the city of Niterói, Brazil, as a case study. In recent years, the office has been increasingly adopting drones for automatizing or simplifying a number of processes with varying degrees of success, and intend to adopt information and knowledge management systems to support and optimize their use. We present a list of the current drone-aided tasks performed by the office, as well some potential applications that are not yet feasible for one reason or another. We further analyze those obstacles and discuss what can be done to address them. Copyright © 2022 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The use of non-destructive technologies for the construction of underground networks has been gaining strength in recent years. Especially in metropolitan regions, the option is to have the lowest possible impact in the face of existing interferences, since these impacts generate indirect costs that are generally not very tangible, such as, for example, the social costs pertaining to them. Also, compared to trenching, non-destructive methods are shorter in duration, cause minimal interference with traffic and commerce, and in most cases, require no surface excavation. In this way, this article brings to light the benefits and advantages involved in the use of non-destructive methods in the installation of underground electricity networks, in contrast to the traditional method of 'open pit'.

In the context of smart cities, solid waste management is one of the problems that has gained greater prominence in recent years, discussed with greater emphasis in conjunction with environmental issues. This paper implements a solution based on Low Power Wide Area Network (LPWAN) and blockchain technologies to provide a fault-tolerant solution for collecting data from the position (latitude and longitude) and the amount of garbage into trash bins. These data are used to calculate a daily optimal route for trucks that collect solid waste.

As a result, the following issue arises: what are the educational practices for schooling in the Covid-19 period in sustainable cities? To address this issue, the following goal was set: to map the educational strategies of sustainable cities for education in the Covid-19 era, based on a bibliometric review. A bibliometric search in the Web of Science database was done to this goal. The educational strategy, according to the findings of the Covid-19 epidemic, is linked to the interdependencies between business, nature, society, economy, and education. These interconnectors may be found in the 17 SDGs, as well as a deeper environmental awareness, which can be accomplished by active methodology, such as establishing an issue that can be solved in the classroom, and employing problem solving as active and dynamic education. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

The popularization of Streaming APIs, which enable parallel processing of native data structures with relatively succinct constructs, presents challenges related to functional programming, and faults from the APIs' misuse are already objects of study. However, no comprehensive mutation operators have been defined for this purpose. We propose seven mutation operators to simulate stream-related faults. To evaluate our operators, we mined 22 open-source projects from different domains (i.e., applications for smart cities and messaging frameworks) to identify faults our operators could simulate. We analyzed 357 commits, raising 91 fixes for stream-related faults in GitHub Java projects. Our operators can simulate 96.7% of the analyzed faults, and we verified five of our proposals in practice. Our mutation operators can enhance the capabilities of current mutation testing tools and help developers to improve their test suites by avoiding stream-related faults.  © 2022 ACM.},

	abstract = {The use of a mobile sink in wireless sensor networks has been a game changing to enable the development of smart cities applications. The mobility feature allows more effective data gathering and energy saving in the network, since the sink can be closer to source nodes, which could activate their radios only when the sink approximates. Doing so, more efficient settings can be achieved when configuring and deploying sensor nodes for a myriad of applications. However, this mobility-centric strategy can generate applications scenarios with large delays when sensor networks are monitoring the environment, which may result in considerable data losses in critical applications. To cope with that, this paper proposes an algorithm to dynamically plan the repositioning of a single mobile sink within distributed sensing applications. The algorithm considers dependability requirements associated with network connectivity, operability, and energy consumption, implicitly minimizing the energy-hole problem and connectivity issues. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate how the can be applied to move the sink through the network meeting dependability requirements.  © 2022 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Urban traffic congestion has a significant detrimental impact on the environment, public health and the economy, with at a high cost to society worldwide. Moreover, it is not possible to continually modify urban road infrastructure in order to mitigate increasing traffic demand. Therefore, it is important to develop traffic control models that can handle high-volume traffic data and synchronize traffic lights in an urban network in real time, without interfering with other initiatives. Within this context, this study proposes a model, based on deep reinforcement learning, for synchronizing the traffic signals of an urban traffic network composed of two intersections. The calibration of this model, including training of its neural network, was performed using real traffic data collected at the approach to each intersection. The results achieved through simulations were very promising, yielding significant improvements in indicators measured in relation to the pre-existing conditions in the network. The model was able to deal with a broad spectrum of traffic flows and, in peak demand periods, reduced delays and queue lengths by more than 28% and 42%, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {A smart city can be described as an organizational environment that seeks to provide a better quality of life for citizens by applying digital technologies to public services. In general, ICT governance involves managing investments and ICT resources to guide organizations to achieve their strategic goals. Thus, ICT governance in smart cities should evaluate, direct, and monitor Information Technology to achieve public value for the local community by providing digital services. Most research investigated ICT governance in private and public organizations and smart governance in smart city environments, but few focused on ICT governance in smart cities, especially in developing countries. Thus, this research investigated ICT governance in the context of Brazilian smart cities by developing a conceptual and practical integrative approach for the cities. To achieve this objective, a literature review and a survey with Brazilian professionals were conducted to identify relevant ICT governance practices applied to this context. As a result, this work introduces a set of related practices that municipalities can track when designing smart city projects in a digital transformation environment. © 2021 ACM.},

	abstract = {Real-time detection of possible deforestation of urban landscapes is an essential task for many urban forest monitoring services. Computational methods emerge as a rapid and efficient solution to evaluate bird's-eye-view images taken by satellites, drones, or even street-view photos captured at the ground level of the urban scenery. Identifying unhealthy trees requires detecting the tree itself and its constituent parts to evaluate certain aspects that may indicate unhealthiness, being street-level images a cost-effective and feasible resource to support the fieldwork survey. This paper proposes detecting trees and their specific parts on street-view images through a Convolutional Neural Network model based on the well-known You Only Look Once network with a MobileNet as the backbone for feature extraction. Essentially, from a photo taken from the ground, the proposed method identifies trees, isolates them through their bounding boxes, identifies the crown and stem, and then estimates the height of the trees by using a specific handheld object as a reference in the images. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.  © 2022 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

	abstract = {This chapter presents recent experiences using open data from different cities to extract and structure knowledge about several aspects of mobility in urban areas. Most of them are dedicated to Curitiba, Brazil, a large city in Southern Brazil recognized since 1960s as innovative in urban planning and transportation. Three approaches are considered for modeling mobility from open data: complex network models, link stream models, and computing origin-destination in transport and traffic of vehicles. Complex network models of transportation systems reveal structures that characterize patterns in transportation. Links stream models capture the temporal behavior of transportation systems, and provide information about congestion, transfer of passengers, and bunching phenomena. Moreover, this chapter brings research on approaches for characterizing origin and destinations in public and private transport. Based on data from smart card ticketing in public transportation, relevant information is gathered about people using public transport for displacement in different hours of the day. On the other hand, taxi trips recorded during a day can characterize private transport, providing the information to map relevant flows of vehicles in a city with eventual impact on traffic. Results of origin-destination of vehicles in Oporto, Portugal, are presented. The experiences of the successful Smart City Concepts in Curitiba project are reported as well, which represents a triple helix model involving academia, public, and private sectors. Its results are discussed with emphasis on the relationship between partners and how they can be shared across different players that affect urban organization and public policies for urban areas. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

In order to make their respective professional and life skills available to future generations, we have set up two international working groups, the ISCW and IS.Smart, in collaboration with the UFC universities of Fortaleza (Brazil), UIR of Rabat (Morocco) and UNITO of Turin (Italy), which for some years now, have been working to transform the notions of smart cities and smart buildings, combined with the new industrial revolution 4.0 and tokenomics, into concrete, multidisciplinary and educational activities. This publication, the result of the work developed in the last three years, intends to be an easy-to-read and application tool for all operators who wish to approach the "smart world" in a professional manner, especially in situations with serious housing shortage and still in the process of social and economic development. By reporting experiences and methodologies already field tested by the author in some working circumstances and that have given rise to case studies, similar to the "Polo Multimodal Pecem" (Brazil), the reader will find useful insights such as the definition of the smart concept and "smart" objectives, the approach to the project, the definition of evaluation parameters, operational examples of management, capital raising and crowdfunding, tokenomics and economy. I do believe that the future of the city will be increasingly linked to these issues, which have now become fundamental and necessary in the projection and planning processes of urban settlements. © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.},

With the reduction in manual work and the adoption of automation, cities are getting more efficient and smarter. However, this evolution also made data even more sensitive, especially in the industrial segment. The latter has caught the attention of many hackers targeting Industrial IoT (IIoT) devices or networks, hence the number of malicious software, i.e., malware, has increased as well. In this article, we present the IIoT concept and applications for smart cities, besides also presenting the security challenges faced by this emerging area. We survey currently available deep learning (DL) techniques for IIoT in smart cities, mainly deep reinforcement learning, recurrent neural networks, and convolutional neural networks, and highlight the advantages and disadvantages of security-related methods. We also present insights, open issues, and future trends applying DL techniques to enhance IIoT security.  © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart cities are one of the emerging domains for computational applications. Many of these applications may benefit from the ubiquitous computing paradigm to provide better services. An important aspect of these applications is how to obtain data about their users and understand them. Context-aware approaches has been proven to be successful in understanding these data. These solutions obtain data from one or more sensors and apply context recognition techniques to infer higher level information. Several works in the last decade have presented ubiquitous approaches for context recognition that can be applied in smart cities. Our work presents a systematic mapping that provides an overview of context recognition approaches applied in smart cities domains. Several aspects of these approaches have been analyzed, such as reasoning techniques, sensors usage, context level, and applications. Of the total 3627 papers returned in the search, 93 papers were analyzed after two filtering processes. The analysis of these papers have shown that only few recent works explored situation recognition information and the full potential of the sensing capabilities in smart cities.The main objective of this article is the identification of future open context recognition approaches allowing the development of news solutions and research. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, AT part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Since the early 2000s, life in cities has changed significantly due to the Internet of Things (IoT). This concept enables developers to integrate different devices collecting, storing, and processing a large amount of data, enabling new services to improve various professional and personal activities. However, privacy issues arise with a large amount of data generated, and solutions based on blockchain technology and smart contract have been developed to address these issues. Nevertheless, several issues must still be taken into account when developing blockchain architectures aimed at the IoT scenario because security flaws still exist in smart contracts, mainly due to the lack of ease when building the code. This article presents a blockchain storage architecture focused on license plate recognition (LPR) systems for smart cities focusing on privacy, performance, and security. The proposed architecture relies on the Ethereum platform. Each smart contract matches the privacy preferences of a license plate to be anonymized through public encryption. The storage of data captured by the LPR system can only be done if the smart contract enables it. However, in the case of motivation foreseen by the legislation, a competent user can change the smart contract and enable the storage of the data captured by the LPR system. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed architecture is satisfactory, regarding the scalability of the built private network. Furthermore, tests on our smart contract using security and structure analysis tools on the developed script demonstrate that our solution is fraud-proof. The results obtained in all experiments bring evidence that our architecture is feasible to be used in real scenarios. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Nevertheless, just a few projects demonstrate how to deploy and make the connection among the employed systems. This paper proposes an approach towards the integration of a MAS through the JaCaMo framework plus an Urban Simulation Tool (SUMO), IoT applications (Node-RED, InfluxDB, and Grafana), and an IoT platform (Konker). The integration presented in this paper applies in a Smart Parking scenario with real features, where is shown the integration and the connection through all layers, from agent level to artifacts, including real environment and simulation, as well as IoT applications. In future works, we intend to establish a methodology that shows how to properly integrate these different applications regardless of the scenario and the used tools. © 2022, Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Institute of Informatics.

	abstract = {The term "smart city" has been used extensively by technologists and the media to describe a place where modern technologies, mostly information and communications technologies (ICTs), are widely used by local governments, institutions, and citizens. Technology is always seen as a way forward. "The more, the better. They will be beneficial to citizens eventually, in one way or another." Or will they? Well, maybe, but not necessarily. This chapter argues that the humane side of urban planning should be taken into account first. Humane is not only one of the dimensions of a proposed solution. It is the dimension to guide all the others. In fact, every city project should start with a clear definition of what is the actual citizen's problem that is being solved, and its results should be measured against that goal. For instance, a control center is a costly and useful tool to measure and orientate car traffic in the city. But its cost should be evaluated and compared against other solutions that improve mobility of citizens in town, not mobility of cars. There is a subtle difference here. Mobility of car drivers is not a measure of citizen's mobility as a whole. A proper bike lane or an improvement in the public transportation system, for instance, may offer much better and cheaper solutions when the focus is changed from the car to the citizen. Once citizens' wishes, interests, and needs are clearly identified, technology will be, of course, part of the solution. It is just a question of resetting priorities: people and the environment first; then, comes everything else. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021. All rights reserved.},

Additionally, for a considerable group of applications, monitoring units may be attached to mobile elements, which may incur in connectivity interruptions. In this context, this work proposes a general hardware architecture to support the development of offline multi-sensor monitoring units, defining a reference operation that can be easily adapted to any application. Moreover, a prototype of a monitoring unit for bicycles is defined, indicating the hardware components that have to be used for eventual physical production.

	abstract = {Emerging Web applications based on distributed IoT sensor systems and machine intelligence, such as in smart city scenarios, have posed many challenges to network and processing infrastructures. For example, environment monitoring cameras generate massive data streams to event-based applications that require fast processing for immediate actions. Finding a missing person in public spaces is an example of these applications, since his/her location is a piece of perishable information. Recently, the integration of edge computing with machine intelligence has been explored as a promising strategy to interpret such massive data near the sensor and reduce the end-to-end latency of processing events. However, due to the limited capacity and heterogeneity of edge resources, the placement of task processing is not trivial, especially when applications have different quality of service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to solve the optimization problem of allocating a set of nodes with sufficient processing capacity to execute a pipeline of tasks while minimizing the operational cost related to latency and energy and maximizing availability. We compare our algorithm with the resource allocation algorithms (first-fit, best-fit, and worst-fit), achieving a lower cost in scenarios with different nodes' heterogeneity. We also demonstrate that distributing processing across multiple edge nodes reduces latency and energy consumption and still improves availability compared to processing only in the cloud. © 2021 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

In this context, factors such as distance between nodes, types of antennas and different Spreading Factor (SF) are considered. In addition, metrics Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Latency, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Packet Loss Rate (PDR) are collected from a real scenario in the city of Teresina in Brazil. Furthermore, a simulation to analyze the lifetime of the sensor nodes using energy consumption is run. Results show that the LoRaWAN technology proved to be a viable option, with low cost, low energy consumption, covering a distance of up to 2000 meters with packet loss rate of 0.3%, low SNR and latency of 23ms, with shipment of up to 12000 packages with node life of 2081 days, reaching a total consumption of 0.0105 mWh, even with all the barriers of the real scenario. © 2021 University of Split, FESB.},

	abstract = {Whilst a plethora of research exists on the smart cities and project performance evalua-tions, only few studies have focused on the smart city policy evaluation from the perspective of its acceptance by practitioners. This paper aims to generate insights by evaluating the smart city policy through a developing country case study—i.e., Malaysia. This study employed a questionnaire survey method for data collection and analyzed the data by using Fuzzy Delphi analysis. A group of 40 practitioners was gathered in a focus group discussion through purposive sampling. The main objectives of this survey were to identify the understanding and acceptance levels of the seven smart city domains and respective strategies that are outlined in the Malaysian Smart City Framework. The results disclosed that the practitioners possessed divergent levels of understanding and acceptance in terms of smart city domains. The study participant practitioners accepted all understanding and acceptance objectives of smart economy, living, people, and governance domains (expert agreement 75–92% and threshold d value 0.123–0.188), but rejected all objectives for both smart environment and digital infrastructure domains (expert agreement 55–74% and threshold d value 0.150–0.212). Along with this, acceptance of smart mobility was also rejected (expert agreement 56% and threshold d value 0.245). The findings reveal that considering all opinions expressing dissensus is essential when building more inclusive smart city strategies. This study contributes to the smart city discourse as being one of the first in capturing professional practitioners’ understanding and acceptance on a national level smart city policy by applying the Delphi method in the smart city context. Most importantly, the study informs urban policymakers on how to capture the voices and perspectives of the general public on national and local smart city strategy and initiatives. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Low-Power Wide-Area Networking (LPWAN) has become a key technology for connecting devices on the Internet-of-Things (IoT) context because of their long range and low-power capabilities. The LoRa (Long Range) modulation technique is getting more and more attention as a LPWAN for many application fields such as smart cities, smart industries, smart health and so on. In this way, evaluation of LoRa devices performance is needed to give support for new developments, mainly related to low-power applications. Although, there is a lack of studies about reducing the LoRa consumption, optimizing its parameters, which are important to the development of these applications, such as in energy harvesting systems. Then, in this work, some practical results of a LoRa-based node power consumption are shown aiming to compare energy consumption versus different LoRa parameter configurations for energy saving. In addition, a method for energy consumption optimization is introduced. Furthermore, the computed optimal values of the parameters Spreading Factor (SF), Bandwidth (BW) and Transmission Power (Ptx) for a sensor node that uses a SX1276 LoRa radio are also shown.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {One of the decisive aspects in Smart Cities is to provide inclusive spaces, for those who suffer from a condition that limits their interaction with the environment, but in several cases that information is only designed for average people. Zoos visual information is an example of well-designed signals for providing data associated with the species in the exhibition, but all this information is colorful and with different signals, such as the colors of the species, their habitat including their food and geographical distribution, which it means that is not the must inclusive information for people that cannot perceive colors or that has some kind of condition that difficulties metal associations. Thus, any child who has a condition associated with the identification of colors, or certain mental condition will have difficulties to understand the zoo signals. Down syndrome is the most frequent cause of mental disability, presenting similar difficulties among people who suffer from it; a short-term memory capacity, exhausting attention and language delay are some of its most frequent characteristics. In Mexico, only 3% of children with Down Syndrome receive education. However, there are several technological alternatives that has been implemented around the world, and the use of robots is gradually becoming a good alternative for assisting and performing therapy to people that suffers this disability. NAO is an Aldebaran humanoid robot with several sensors, actuators and tools, that can be programmed with python, which has helped to popularize this friendly robot in the assisting of people. In this paper, we propose the use of a humanoid robot for future applications in therapy for children with Down Syndrome. To this purpose, we propose how to improve their ability to work with colors and shapes in a group of children with Down Syndrome. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The fast transformation of the urban centers, pushed by the impacts of climatic changes and the dramatic events of the COVID-19 Pandemic, will profoundly influence our daily mobility. This resulted scenario is expected to favor adopting cleaner and flexible modal solutions centered on bicycles and scooters, especially as last-mile options. However, as the use of bicycles has rapidly increased, cyclists have been subject to adverse conditions that may affect their health and safety when cycling in urban areas. Therefore, whereas cities should implement mechanisms to monitor and evaluate adverse conditions in cycling paths, cyclists should have some effective mechanism to visualize the indirect quality of cycling paths, eventually supporting choosing more appropriate routes. Therefore, this article proposes a comprehensive multi-parameter system based on multiple independent subsystems, covering all phases of data collecting, formatting, transmission, and processing related to the monitoring, evaluating, and visualizing the quality of cycling paths in the perspective of adverse conditions that affect cyclist. The formal interactions of all modules are carefully described, as well as implementation and deployment details. Additionally, a case study is considered for a large city in Brazil, demonstrating how the proposed system can be adopted in a real scenario. © 2021 by the authors.

The purpose of this article is to identify and map the existing relationships between the indicators of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) for smart cities with the Multivariate Linear Regression through scripts written in Python language. To achieve the functions that describe such relationships, data from the 5,570 Brazilian cities were collected, concerning their population and 24 maturity indicators for smart cities. A previous analysis was carried out for identifying, among all the collected indicators, those with stronger relevance in Brazilian scenario to improve the cities’ maturity, resulting in four indicators that were further examined.

	abstract = {Smart cities are nowadays equipped with pervasive networks of sensors that monitor traffic in real-time and record huge volumes of traffic data. These datasets constitute a rich source of information that can be used to extract knowledge useful for municipalities and citizens. In this paper we are interested in exploiting such data to estimate future speed in traffic sensor networks, as accurate predictions have the potential to enhance decision making capabilities of traffic management systems. Building effective speed prediction models in large cities poses important challenges that stem from the complexity of traffic patterns, the number of traffic sensors typically deployed, and the evolving nature of sensor networks. Indeed, sensors are frequently added to monitor new road segments or replaced/removed due to different reasons (e.g., maintenance). Exploiting a large number of sensors for effective speed prediction thus requires smart solutions to collect vast volumes of data and train effective prediction models. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of real-world sensor networks calls for solutions that are resilient not only to changes in traffic behavior, but also to changes in the network structure, where the cold start problem represents an important challenge. We study three different approaches in the context of large and dynamic sensor networks: local, global, and cluster-based. The local approach builds a specific prediction model for each sensor of the network. Conversely, the global approach builds a single prediction model for the whole sensor network. Finally, the cluster-based approach groups sensors into homogeneous clusters and generates a model for each cluster. We provide a large dataset, generated from ∼1.3 billion records collected by up to 272 sensors deployed in Fortaleza, Brazil, and use it to experimentally assess the effectiveness and resilience of prediction models built according to the three aforementioned approaches. The results show that the global and cluster-based approaches provide very accurate prediction models that prove to be robust to changes in traffic behavior and in the structure of sensor networks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {We consider the design of distributed algorithms that govern the manner in which agents contribute to a social sensing platform. Specifically, we are interested in situations, where fairness among the agents contributing to the platform is needed. A notable example is the platforms operated by public bodies, where fairness is a legal requirement. The design of such distributed systems is challenging due to the fact that we wish to simultaneously realize an efficient social sensing platform but also deliver a predefined quality of service to the agents (for example, a fair opportunity to contribute to the platform). In this article, we introduce iterated function systems (IFSs) as a tool for the design and analysis of systems of this kind. We show how the IFS framework can be used to realize systems that deliver a predictable quality of service to agents, can be used to underpin contracts governing the interaction of agents with the social sensing platform, and which are efficient. To illustrate our design via a use case, we consider a large, high-density network of participating parked vehicles. When awoken by an administrative center, this network proceeds to search for moving missing entities of interest using RFID-based techniques. We regulate which vehicles are actively searching for the moving entity of interest at any point in time. In doing so, we seek to equalize vehicular energy consumption across the network. This is illustrated through simulations of a search for a missing Alzheimer's patient in Melbourne, Australia. The experimental results are presented to illustrate the efficacy of our system and the predictability of access of agents to the platform independent of initial conditions.  © 2014 IEEE.},

For this purpose, a data mining process was conducted to analyze the terms that had a higher incidence in the literature in order to classify them by relevance and identify their interdependencies in the concepts of sustainable cities and smart cities. As a result, we highlight that the Fourth Industrial Revolution will have implications on several factors that are deeply connected to the success of cities in becoming sustainable: job creation, industries, innovation, environmental preservation, community involvement, and accessibility. In this context, policymakers will have opportunities and challenges that must be faced. Big data, the IoT, augmented reality, and simulations can have positive and negative externalities. Positive externalities include new information that could be mined, analyzed, and used for identifying previously unseen problems, the provision of new industrial innovations that can make economies thrive, helping promote inclusion for disabled people, as well as helping society to foresee problems and hence adapt to them in a timely manner. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {Rio de Janeiro has two of the biggest urban forests in Brazil. They receive many tourists every year and as they have such an extensive area, some people get lost. Rescue tasks have to mobilize firefighters, helicopters and many public resources. Seeking to reduce the public sector’s cost, this paper presents an applied approach for monitoring visitors to reduce the time for these rescue tasks. In order to do that, sensors are displayed in a grid, taking into consideration limits of the technology and the area of the urban forest. Besides, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is used to collect the data generated by the sensors and the UAV battery is also considered for making feasible solutions closer to the real scenario, as the urban forests usually have big areas. An integer programming formulation is proposed, along side with a metaheuristic. The proposed metaheuristic framework is used for finding solutions for the proposed optimization problem. Experiments show that the integer programming formulation failed to obtain feasible solution in the given timelimit, while the GRASP methodology was able obtained solution in at most, 20 s. After analysis, one may verify that this approach could be used as public policy to improve urban management in the context of smart and digital cities. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

One of the most evolving technological developments in recent years for analyzing the vast amount of information generated by billions of texts published by citizens in the Internet is Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially when used for text categorization, sentiment analysis and topic extraction. With the advent of NLP techniques, Artificial Intelligence has become applicable in different areas of science, business, and government. Although there have been advances in the application of Artificial Intelligence methods in societal problems, there is a strong lack of technologies for urban ser-vices management. This paper presents Daoura, a data intelligence platform for smart city management that transforms publications of citizens on the Internet into relevant insights, and its case on forecasting 2020 Chilean national plebiscite results for a new constitution, based on analyzing millions of citizens interactions in social media. The platform's projections reported an accuracy of 95.8% when compared to the final results, showing the importance of digital manifestations on understanding people's opinions and experiences in the society. We also discuss the significative impacts Daoura NLP skills can have on modernizing public management and creating environments that promote well-being and quality of life in cities. © 2021 IEEE.},

The insertion of industries in the context of smart cities and other smart environments, allied with new communication technologies such as 5G, brings a new horizon of possibilities and new requirements. These requirements include low latency, the support of a massive quantity of devices and data, and the need to support horizontal communications between devices at the edge level. To make this feasible, it is necessary to establish an IIoT-to-cloud continuum distributing federated brokers across the infrastructure and providing scalability and interoperability. To attend this type of application, we present the Helix Multi-layered IoT platform and its operating modes. We report and discuss its real-world deployment in the Aveiro Tech City Living Lab in Aveiro, Portugal with functional and performance tests. We tested device-to-device communication across edge and core layers and also interconnected the infrastructure with one in São Paulo, Brazil, replicating the use of a global industry. The successful deployment validates the use of a Helix Multi-layered IoT platform as a suitable backend platform for IIoT applications capable of establishing the IIoT-to-cloud continuum. It also helps for the deployment of other applications in such a domain. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Digital societies could be characterized by their increasing desire to express themselves and interact with others. This is being realized through digital platforms such as social media that have increasingly become convenient and inexpensive sensors compared to physical sensors in many sectors of smart societies. One such major sector is road transportation, which is the backbone of modern economies and costs globally 1.25 million deaths and 50 million human injuries annually. The cutting-edge on big data-enabled social media analytics for transportation-related studies is limited. This paper brings a range of technologies together to detect road traffic-related events using big data and distributed machine learning. The most specific contribution of this research is an automatic labelling method for machine learning-based traffic-related event detection from Twitter data in the Arabic language. The proposed method has been implemented in a software tool called Iktishaf+ (an Arabic word meaning discovery) that is able to detect traffic events automatically from tweets in the Arabic language using distributed machine learning over Apache Spark. The tool is built using nine components and a range of technologies including Apache Spark, Parquet, and MongoDB. Iktishaf+ uses a light stemmer for the Arabic language developed by us. We also use in this work a location extractor developed by us that allows us to extract and visualize spatio-tem-poral information about the detected events. The specific data used in this work comprises 33.5 million tweets collected from Saudi Arabia using the Twitter API. Using support vector machines, naïve Bayes, and logistic regression-based classifiers, we are able to detect and validate several real events in Saudi Arabia without prior knowledge, including a fire in Jeddah, rains in Makkah, and an accident in Riyadh. The findings show the effectiveness of Twitter media in detecting important events with no prior knowledge about them. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Thinking about sustainable actions for big cities is one of the problems of the twenty-first century. This demand is faced by cities in the different dimensions that make it up: social, economic, and environmental. Just as companies should think about adopting and investing in Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG), cities need to become smart cities, an important step to transform themselves into sustainable cities with a higher quality of life. ESG, in companies, refers to the three central factors for measuring the sustainability and social impact of an investment process. Cities need to focus, in addition to modernizing their infrastructure, on strengthening the circular economy, investing more in education, reducing school dropout, which is closely linked to the area of security in cities, and based on these measures, seek balance in all areas of society. The concepts of smart cities and sustainable cities will be presented, showing the interconnection of both concepts. The purpose of this chapter is to show how to build smart cities and how they are transformed into sustainable cities. Thus, a systematic and integrative review was carried out in the Scopus database, in order to answer the following questions: (1) What are smart cities? (2) How to transform cities into smart cities? (3) What is the interconnection between the two concepts: smart cities and sustainable cities? (4) How do smart cities contribute to building a sustainable city? The results converge in the relationship between intelligence and sustainability, being the basis for a new type of city that directs its growth in an intentional, collaborative, and inclusive way to transform urban centers into a place with a higher quality of life. This chapter brings two examples of smart cities: one in Portugal and another in Brazil, explaining how the national legislation of each country and its social reality interfere in the construction of smart cities. The main innovation presented is the indicators for transforming smart cities into sustainable cities. For this purpose, the chapter is divided into eight sections, which are entitled: Introduction, Smart Cities, Sustainable Cities, Methodology, Relationship Between Sustainable Cities and Intelligent Cities, From Smart Cities Toward Sustainable Cities: Inclusion and Life Quality, Case Studies: Smart Cities from Brazil and Portugal, and Conclusions. ©The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

However, with the increasing number of data sent by devices, applications have come to demand increased availability and Internet bandwidth, but these demands are still a bottleneck in regions farther from large urban centers and with less economic development. In this work, we examine how bandwidth limitations can affect cloud-based applications and propose a Fog Computing-based Control-as-a-Service architecture to dynamically process events in the context of Internet of Things and Smart Environments. The architecture is composed of a Rules Engine and a Complex Event Processor based on Supervisory Control techniques for Discrete Event Systems. The Rules Engine allows defining dynamic rules conditioning control from different types of input data. The Complex Event Processor with automatic synthesis and reconfiguration capability allows performing control actions to established rules. Finally, we present scenarios where this solution can be applied, such as Smart Farm, Smart Home, Smart City, and Smart Healthcare. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Advances in the miniaturization, computational capabilities, and cost reduction of semiconductor technology have made global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) the favorite choice for positioning. Currently, positioning is a key factor for many essential tasks in our modern society and will become even more important with the advent of new concepts such as the Internet of Things (IoT), smart cities and autonomous driving. The extensive use of GNSSs in a wide range of applications has caused their migration from the professional segment to the mass-market segment in terms of both technology and performance. This presents new and more stringent requirements in terms of accuracy, robustness, ubiquity, and continuity for the original 'open sky' GNSS design. GNSS technology has experienced an unprecedented evolution in the last decade, and it is expected to exponentially evolve in the next decade. This evolution is considered in this paper with the aim of providing a unified reference for current GNSS receiver technologies and solutions and its expected evolution in the next decade. We consider receiver concepts, antennae, RF front ends, digital signal processing, and positioning algorithms. The impacts on the different GNSS market segments and applications are also analyzed.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart cities and artificial intelligence (AI) are among the most popular discourses in urban policy circles. Most attempts at using AI to improve efficiencies in cities have nevertheless ei-ther struggled or failed to accomplish the smart city transformation. This is mainly due to short-sighted, technologically determined and reductionist AI approaches being applied to complex urbanization problems. Besides this, as smart cities are underpinned by our ability to engage with our environments, analyze them, and make efficient, sustainable and equitable decisions, the need for a green AI approach is intensified. This perspective paper, reflecting authors’ opinions and interpretations, concentrates on the “green AI” concept as an enabler of the smart city trans-formation, as it offers the opportunity to move away from purely technocentric efficiency solutions towards efficient, sustainable and equitable solutions capable of realizing the desired urban fu-tures. The aim of this perspective paper is two-fold: first, to highlight the fundamental shortfalls in mainstream AI system conceptualization and practice, and second, to advocate the need for a consolidated AI approach—i.e., green AI—to further support smart city transformation. The methodological approach includes a thorough appraisal of the current AI and smart city litera-tures, practices, developments, trends and applications. The paper informs authorities and plan-ners on the importance of the adoption and deployment of AI systems that address efficiency, sustainability and equity issues in cities. © 2021 by the authors.

In this work, we simulate a system of autonomous vehicles co-existing with human-driven vehicles, analyzing the consequences of system design choices. The system consists of a network of arterial roads with exclusive lanes for autonomous vehicles where they can travel in platoons. This paper presents the evaluation of this system in realistic scenarios evaluating the impacts of the system on travel time using mesoscopic traffic simulation. We used real data from the metropolis of São Paulo to create the simulation scenarios. The results show that the proposed system would bring reductions to the average travel time of the city commuters and other benefits such as the reduction of the space required to handle all the traffic. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Besides the sometimes obvious benefits of adopting bikes for transportation, technologies around the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm have been advocated as important supportive tools to boost smart cycling initiatives. Actually, new technologies can be exploited to improve the efficiency of bike paths and parking spots, while reducing accidents and enhancing the cycling experience of the users. Therefore, in this highly vibrating scenario, this article facilitates the understating of current research trends and promising developments, surveying and classing recent works.

For this reason, offload tasks or data to other layers such as fog or cloud is regularly adopted to smooth out this issue. Although data offloading is a well-known aspect of fog computing, the specification of offloading policies is still an open issue due to the lack of clear guidelines. Therefore, we propose OffFog - an approach to guide the definition of data offloading policies in the context of fog computing. In order to evaluate OffFog, we extended the well-known simulator iFogSim and conducted an experimental study based on an urban surveillance system. The results demonstrated the benefits of implementing data offloading based on OffFog recommended policies. Furthermore, we identified the best configuration involving design decisions such as data compression, data criticality, and storage thresholds. The best configuration produced at least 76% improvement in network latency and 5% in the average execution time compared to the iFogSim default strategy. We believe these results represent a significant step towards establishing a systematic decision framework for data offloading policies in the context of fog computing.  © 2022 Sávio Melo et al.},

All such aspects and the heterogeneity of different IoT components (e.g., network interfaces, communication protocols, data structure, and data semantics) have caused interoperability issues which might hamper the effectiveness of support decision systems for smart cities, where the use of big data and machine learning techniques has been considered, in addition to the exploration of smart city data. This article proposes an environment IoT-based platform for smart cities that grants interoperability from data capture to knowledge extraction and visualization through the use of Semantic Web Technologies and the definition of an ontology for environment indicators. The components of the platform include IoT devices, gateways, cloud, and fog computing, which are used for a better application of big data techniques. A real environment quality monitoring use case was considered for the validation of the platform. Metrics, such as latency and resources consumption, were analyzed for three communication protocols, namely, MQTT, CoAP, and REST.

	abstract = {The advent of 5G will bring a massive adoption of IoT devices across our society. IoT Applications (IoT Apps) will be the primary data collection base. This scenario leads to unprecedented scalability and security challenges, with one of the first areas for these applications being Smart Cities (SC). IoT devices in new network paradigms, such as Edge Computing and Fog Computing, will collect data from urban environments, providing real-time management information. One of these challenges is ensuring that the data sent from Edge Computing are reliable. Blockchain has been a technology that has gained the spotlight in recent years, due to its robust security in fintech and cryptocurrencies. Its strong encryption and distributed and decentralized network make it potential for this challenge. Using Blockchain with IoT makes it possible for SC applications to have security information distributed, which makes it possible to shield against Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS). IoT devices in an SC can have a long life, which increases the chance of having security holes caused by outdated firmware. Adding a layer of identification and verification of attributes and signature of messages coming from IoT devices by Smart Contracts can bring confidence in the content. SC Apps that extract data from legacy and outdated appliances, installed in inaccessible, unknown, and often untrusted urban environments can benefit from this work. Our work’s main contribution is the development of API Gateways to be used in IoT devices and network gateway to sign, identify, and authorize messages. For this, keys and essential characteristics of the devices previously registered in Blockchain are used. We will discuss the importance of this implementation while considering the SC and present a testbed that is composed of Blockchain Ethereum and real IoT devices. We analyze the transfer time, memory, and CPU impacts during the sending and processing of these messages. The messages are signed, identified, and validated by our API Gateways and only then collected for an IoT data management application. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Due to the high mobility, dynamic nature, and legacy vehicular networks, the seamless connectivity and reliability become a new challenge in software-defined internet of vehicles based intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Thus, effieicnt optimization of the link with proper monitoring of the high speed of vehicles in ITS is very vital to promote the error-free and trustable platform. Key issues related to reliability, connectivity and stability optimization for vehicular networks are addressed. Thus, this study proposes a novel reliable connectivity framework by developing a stable, and scalable link optimization (SSLO) algorithm, state-of-the-art system model. In addition, a Use-case of smart city with stable and reliable connectivity is proposed by examining the importance of vehicular networks. The numerical experimental results are extracted from software defined-Internet of Vehicle (SD-IoV) platform which shows high stability and reliability of the proposed SSLO under different test scenarios, such as vehicle to vehicle (V2V), vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle to anything (V2X). The proposed SSLO and Baseline algorithms are compared in terms of performance metrics e.g. packet loss ratio, transmission power (i.e., stability), average throughput, and average delay transfer. Finally, the validated results reveal that SSLO algorithm optimizes connectivity (95%), energy efficiency (67%), throughput (4Kbps) and delay (3 sec). © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

This type of data is paramount to help decision makers in different contexts, such as smart cities, mobile social networks, and e-commerce. In addition, the behavior of mobile users can be extracted and exploited to improve the quality of the services offered by mobile providers. However, raw location data needs to be semantically enriched to be useful, which is an arduous task because it requires queries on different data sources of different formats and complex joins. To mitigate this difficulty, this work proposes MoreData, a flexible and expandable framework for the semantic enrichment of geospatial data. The framework accepts different input formats, provides connectors to different sources (APIs, Relational Database, Fast Search Engine Tool, and Open Street Map), and is easy to extend to new sources. To evaluate the framework's benefits, we use it to enrich a real database comprised of thousands of mobile users' locations with data. We observe that the adoption of the framework leads to less time and effort in the data enrichment process, saving time for the more important tasks, such as building and analyzing models. © 2021 ACM.},

The goal is to determine whether this market tends towards a scenario where an electric car is perceived as a substitute for a fossil-fuel vehicle, with new technology but the same function (transportation) or if it tends towards a reinterpretation, seeing integration with the electricity grid.

Thus, this paper aims to create a real-time system to alert drivers of inattention moments, and thus reduce the number of traffic accidents. For this, we use computer vision algorithms to determine the driver's gaze direction which, together with vehicle data such as speed and acceleration, infer whether the driver is distracted. The key idea is to calibrate the drive's head rotation thresholds as a function of vehicle speed and acceleration. If the vehicle is at low speed or low acceleration, the head rotation can be more pronounced. In addition to head rotation, we also use blind eye detection as a criterion for determining distraction. The system uses a temporal sliding window procedure to prevent oscillations between inattention and attention states. The implementation is based on hardware and software architectures composed of cost-effective and open source libraries. Experimental results in controlled and real environments show accurate results and quick detection time.  © 2021 IEEE.},

In this context, one of the applications under development intends to track the recyclable garbage collector trucks in real time over the Internet. Actually, fleet vehicle tracking is one of the main applications for smart cities. LoRaWAN stands out among network technologies for smart cities due to operating in an open frequency range, covering long distances with low power consumption and low equipment cost. However, the coverage and performance of LoRaWAN is directly affected by both the environment and configuration parameters. In addition, tracking devices must be able to send its coordinates to the Internet even when the vehicle goes through zones where there are obstacles for electromagnetic waves such as elevated buildings or valleys. In this paper we perform experimental investigations to evaluate four LoRaWAN tracking devices, two available out of the box and two assembled and programmed. The behavior of each tracking device is analyzed when moving at a constant speed through three representative urban areas totaling 10.71 km2. The two most efficient tracking devices are analyzed in a stretch of 3.5 km with speeds ranging from 0 to 30 km/h, 0 to 50 km/h and 0 to 100 km/h. Results include a quantitative and qualitative aspects, including the received signal strength indication (RSSI), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), packet delivery ratio (PDR), and spreading factor (SF) for the received geographic coordinates. As the devices depend on the quality of the signal offered by the network, we also present the results of the development and evaluation of the LoRaWAN network, by planning its coverage throughout the city. © 2021, The Author(s).},

The main conclusions are: (i) there is a symbiosis between the urban innovation ecosystem and the HSSC implementation mainly involving the ICTs, (ii) there is a positive mindset for innovation in the city, (iii) the participation of the stakeholders in the innovation ecosystem and in the HSSC decisions facilitates the development of actions, (iv) the organized civil society plays a major role, and (v) co-creation and co-management based on a triple helix approach provide stability and reduce vulnerability. At the end, this paper presents some considerations about the framework to support the decision-making processes of innovation managers and urban planners. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.

With the potential to save millions of lives, the identification of abnormal driving, like drunk or fatigued drivers, is the central topic of this paper. The efficiency and cost of the algorithms of the driver behavior applications, alongside the data acquisition and analysis of a high number of drivers, are among the main challenges of this field of study. We present a method to detect abnormal driving through standard deviations of the vehicle’s trajectory, velocity, and acceleration. Also, the neural network Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier was applied to analyze the efficiency of predictions. The dataset used was the HighD, which contains post-processed data collected with a drone equipped with a high-resolution camera. The detection of abnormal driving is an important topic in the safety validation of autonomous vehicles.

	abstract = {Vision sensors in Internet of Things (IoT)-connected smart cities play a vital role in the exponential growth of video data, thereby making its analysis and storage comparatively tough and challenging. Those sensors continuously generate data for 24 hours, which requires huge storage resources, dedicated networks for sharing with data centers, and most importantly, it makes browsing, retrieval, and event searching a difficult and time-consuming job. Video summarization (VS) is a promising direction toward a solution to these problems by analyzing the visual contents acquired from a vision sensor and prioritizing them based on events, saliency, person's appearance, and so on. However, the current VS literature still lacks focus on resource-constrained devices that can summarize data over the edge and upload it to data repositories efficiently for instant analysis. Therefore, in this article, we carry out a survey of functional VS methods to understand their pros and cons for resource-constrained devices, with the ambition to provide a compact tutorial to the community of researchers in the field. Further, we present a novel saliency-aware VS framework, incorporating 5G-enabled IoT devices, which keeps only important data, thereby saving storage resources and providing representative data for immediate exploration. Keeping privacy of data as a second priority, we intelligently encrypt the salient frames over resource-constrained devices before transmission over the 5G network. The reported experimental results show that our proposed framework has additional benefits of faster transmission (1.813.77 percent frames of a lengthy video are considered for transmission), reduced bandwidth, and real-time processing compared to state-of-the-art methods in the field.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) based applications have recently experienced a remarkable diffusion in many different contexts, such as automotive, e-health, public security, industrial applications, energy, and waste management. These kinds of applications are characterized by geographically distributed sensors that collect data to be processed through algorithms of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Due to the vast amount of data to be processed by AI algorithms and the severe latency requirements of some applications, the emerging Edge Computing paradigm may represent the preferable choice for the supporting infrastructure. However, the design of edge computing infrastructures opens several new issues concerning the allocation of data flows coming from sensors over the edge nodes, and the choice of the number and the location of the edge nodes to be activated. The service placement issue can be modeled through a multi-objective optimization aiming at minimizing two aspects: the response time for data transmission and processing in the sensors-edge-cloud path; the (energy or monetary) cost related to the number of turned on edge nodes. Two heuristics, based on Variable Neighborhood Search and on Genetic Algorithms, are proposed and evaluated over a wide range of scenarios, considering a realistic smart city application with 100 sensors and up to 10 edge nodes. Both heuristics can return practical solutions for the given application. The results indicate a suitable topology for a network-bound scenario requires less enabled edge nodes comparatively with a CPU-bound scenario. In terms of performance gain, the VNS outperformed in almost every condition the GA approach, reaching a performance gain up to almost 40% when the network delay plays a significant role and when the load is higher. Hence, the experimental tests demonstrate that the proposed heuristics are useful to support the design of edge computing infrastructures for modern AI-based applications relying on data collected by geographically distributed IoT sensors. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) demand technologies so they can not only fly autonomously, but also communicate with base stations, flight controllers, computers, devices, or even other UAVs. Still, UAVs usually operate within unlicensed spectrum bands, competing against the increasing number of mobile devices and other wireless networks. Combining UAVs with Cognitive Radio (CR) may increase their general communication performance, thus allowing them to execute missions where the conventional UAVs face limitations. CR provides a smart wireless communication which, instead of using a transmission frequency defined in the hardware, uses software transmission. CR smartly uses free transmission channels and/or chooses them according to application's requirements. Moreover, CR is considered a key enabler for deploying technologies that require high connectivity, such as Smart Cities, 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), and the Internet of Flying Things (IoFT). This paper presents an overview on the field of CR for UAV communications and its state-of-the-art, testbed alternatives for real data experiments, as well as specifications to build a simple and low-cost testbed, and indicates key opportunities and future challenges in the field.},

One reason is that cities in the country are different in geography, development, economics, education, and technology environments. In the context of digital transformation, cities are promoting innovative trends by adopting smart cities initiatives, in which Information and Communication Technology (ICT) represents a transversal enabler. Studies and frameworks were applied worldwide to characterize cities' smartness, but few focused on ICT governance, especially in subnational governments. From this perspective, this research, based on the fundamentals of digital government, ICT governance, and smart cities, analyzed ICT governance requisites and practices in fifteen Brazilian municipalities best ranked in the Smart City Connected index. The methodology procedures encompassed cities' official websites and transparency portals searches and information requests based on Brazilian Access Information Law. The results evidenced that most Brazilian cities lack a smart city program approach, several cities did not implement ICT governance mechanisms and were not compliant with the Information Access Law, and ICT governance was not conceived as active transparency in some cities portals. Future studies should focus on developing an ICT governance catalog practices for Brazilian's smart cities and a methodology for ICT governance open database as a smart city approach. © 2021 ACM.},

	abstract = {The objective of the study is to investigate the efficient packet transfer among vehicles in the smart city. With the evolution of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communication is becoming more prominent for safety and non-safety related applications. The V2V communication facilitates vehicles to interconnect with each other to support numerous applications that will be highly helpful for drivers and passenger's welfare. However, due to the extreme dynamic nature of transportation, the Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) faces many challenges for transferring information among vehicles. Therefore, efficient clustering and dynamic routing are becoming a supreme area of improvement to increase the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and reduce the End-to-End delay for data transfer. In order to overcome the major obstacle, in this paper, we propose an intelligent self-learning approach-based hybrid clustering by integrating Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and dynamic Dijkstra routing for packet transfer between vehicles. Also, experiments were carried out to support the data transfer with the help of drones to provide higher coverage in high dynamic vehicle mobility scenarios. The proposed algorithm is modeled, trained, and tested for performance evaluations metrics such as Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), End to End delay, CH selection delay.  © 2021 ACM.},

	abstract = {IoT is rapidly progressing and gaining focus in the domain of smart cities. It copes with a lot of economy sectors by enabling to save resources efficiently, be human or material. Also, it allows creating simple applications to ease some tasks of people's daily lives. However, the development of IoT applications is not always a straightforward task, as sensors and actuators are not always readily usable. Furthermore, in scenarios where IoT devices can move unrestrictedly and are not continuously available, the dynamism can pose some challenges for developers. In this sense, the Internet of Mobile Things (IoMT) is an IoT instance where devices are mobile (i.e. not attached to fixed power supplies). To address this issue, we developed the ObsAct programming model. ObsAct is a layer built on top of the ContextNet IoMT middleware that allows programming reactive rule-based applications. In this paper, we will present use case scenarios where ObsAct is used to cope with the Smart Cities challenges. In addition, we show an evaluation of our solution and discuss its outcomes.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a cornerstone building block of smart cities to provide better traffic safety and mobile infotainment. Recently, improved efficiency in WLAN-based dense scenarios has become widespread through Wi-Fi 6, a license-free spectrum technology that can complement the cellular-based infrastructure for IoV. In addition, Named Data Networking (NDN) is a promising Internet architecture to accomplish content distribution in dynamic IoV scenarios. However, NDN deployments, i.e., native (clean-slate) and overlay (running on top of IP stack), require further investigation of their performance over wireless networks, particularly regarding the IoV scenario. This paper performs a comparative simulation-based study of these NDN deployments over Wi-Fi 6 for IoV using real vehicular traces. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort that extends ndnSIM 2 with an overlay-based NDN implementation and that compares it with the native approach. Results show that the overlay-based NDN consistently outperforms the native one, reaching around 99% of requests satisfied, against only 42.35% in the best case of native deployment. © 2022, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

It is a challenge to understand limitations, advantages, and disadvantages of the signals analysis from inertial sensors embedded in IoT devices for monitoring this phenomenon. Landslides can take a long time to collapse completely, and collecting data in real situations can imply a long-term collection, with no guarantees of recording the phenomenon. Promoting accelerated experiments can be an alternative for evaluating algorithms to detect soil movement. Therefore, this paper presents the results of two experiments performed for data collection by inertial sensors deployed in sandy soil in a dump truck. The signals were collected during sand unloading to evaluate the performance of the IoT devices in events similar to a landslide phenomenon.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {NB-IoT is the most suitable mobile network technology for IoT applications that require exceptionally extensive coverage added with extremely low power consumption, since these applications will generally be characterized by low data rates and moderate reaction times, usually in a few seconds, enabling the creation and development of solutions aimed at smart cities and smart environments. The NB-IoT technology can be characterized as a cellular LPWAN technology operating in a downlink within a bandwidth of 180 kHz and a sub-carrier space of 15 kHz and in the uplink, in general with a single tone transmission ranging between 3.75 kHz or 15 kHz, using coverage enhancement techniques, with characteristics of battery life for more than a decade and with specific battery-saving features. The ease that technological solutions of internet of things (IoT) make available through applications connected through intelligent sensors in traffic lights and parking lots; city pollution sensors; meters for energy, water, and sewage in cities, among other possibilities make systems more efficient, considering NB-IoT connectivity in relation to the treatment of information collected by devices allowing applications to be developed to address market needs.

In such context, this study proposes an algorithm to address the vehicle allocation scheduling with a request list unknown a priori, and is revealed along the operation horizon. Based on the OSCO (online stochastic combinatorial optimization) problem, it is presented a framework to operate such problem in a last-mile delivery system where customers requests from e-commerce (or food delivery) along an operations day. The deterministic calculation was realized using a permutational flowshop scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing makespan. Experiments indicated convergence in the algorithm along the planning trials, and a satisfactory makespan prediction, before the orders are revealed, with accuracy. The probability distribution adheres with a bell-shaped (normal) distribution with its population parameters estimated using classical statistics inference theory. Incorporating uncertain in such type of mathematical modeling could open doors for a new era of systems in current days with cloud computing, big data, smart cities, and artificial intelligence. © 2003-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The pervasiveness of mobile devices is a common phenomenon nowadays, and with the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT), an increasing number of connected devices are being deployed. In Smart Cities, data collection, processing, and distribution play critical roles in everyday quality of life and city planning and development. The use of Cloud computing to support massive amounts of data generated and consumed in Smart Cities has some limitations, such as increased latency and substantial network traffic, hampering support for a variety of applications that need low response times. In this chapter, we introduce and discuss aspects of distributed multi-tiered Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) architectures, which offer data storage and processing capabilities closer to data sources and data consumers, taking into account how mobility impacts the management of such infrastructure. The main goal is to address topics on how such infrastructure can be used to support content distribution from and to mobile users, how to optimize the resource allocation in such infrastructure, as well as how an intelligent layer can be added to the MEC/Fog infrastructure. Furthermore, a multifaceted literature review is given, as well as the open issues and challenging aspects of resource and application management will also be discussed in this chapter. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.},

	abstract = {Objective: The perspective of development of smart cities is a trend for the Brazilian Public Administration. It is a technological, interconnected and efficient management model that supplies the urgency of indicators and strategies for innovative and sustainable planning. The concept starts from the use of information and communication technologies (ICT), but progressively evolves towards a holistic view of the urban system, considering its dimensions: Technology (infrastructure), people (education) and institutions (governance). This article aims to analyze the action potential of public libraries for the development of smart cities in order to contribute to a broader, necessary and humane view of the smart cities model. Methods: The research is characterized as bibliographical and documentary, with an exploratory character. To achieve the objective of the article, a literature review was carried out with subsequent content analysis as a technique for treating the qualitative data obtained, which allowed inferring the contributions of public libraries in the context under study. Results: The recovery of only one Brazilian work that discusses the relationship between libraries and smart cities demonstrates this gap in the national literature on Library Science and Information Science. From the content analysis carried out in the 53 works retrieved, the following contributions of public libraries to the development of smart cities were identified: Internet availability, promotion of informational and media literacy, fostering and encouraging innovation, access and dissemination of utilitarian information. Conclusions: It concludes that, in the context of smart cities, the public library has the potential to be a public space that enables citizen participation and community development. © 2021, Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina.

	abstract = {Smart cities are a natural evolution of the concept of sustainable cities. These cities can be analyzed by social, economic, environmental, and technological biases. For this work, we chose the social and economic vision, with a special focus on the poorest and most vulnerable territories of Brazilian cities. These territories in Brazil are called slums, places of poverty but with opportunities for the development of the creative economy with its own brand. Seen by many in a simplistic way, summed up to be geographic spaces of drug circulation dominated by trafficking, Brazilian favelas have been consolidating themselves as a storehouse of innovative minds, a creative territory with multiple and complex cultures. These places today are capable of producing a positive image with potential for market exploitation. Therefore, the objective was to draw a relationship between the creative economy, branding and favelas, considering the concept of smart cities that include products and services from the slums. The present study shows the results of a survey and a bibliographic analysis based on the methodology Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) and with parameters that took into account the favela, branding and the creative economy. Thus, we expect that it will be possible to point out ways to accelerate entrepreneurial actions and foster the development of these locations. © 2021 by the authors.

Still, UAVs usually operate within unlicensed spectrum bands, competing against the increasing number of mobile devices and other wireless networks. Combining UAVs with Cognitive Radio (CR) may increase their general communication performance, thus allowing them to execute missions where the conventional UAVs face limitations. CR provides a smart wireless communication which, instead of using a transmission frequency defined in the hardware, uses software transmission. CR smartly uses free transmission channels and/or chooses them according to application’s requirements. Moreover, CR is considered a key enabler for deploying technologies that require high connectivity, such as Smart Cities, 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), and the Internet of Flying Things (IoFT). This paper presents an overview on the field of CR for UAV communications and its state-of-the-art, testbed alternatives for real data experiments, as well as specifications to build a simple and low-cost testbed, and indicates key opportunities and future challenges in the field. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {License plates are the primary source of vehicle identification data used in a wide range of applications including law enforcement, electronic tolling, and access control amongst others. License plate detection (LPD) is a critical process in automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) that reduces complexity by delimiting the search space for subsequent ALPR stages. It is complicated by unfavourable factors including environmental conditions, occlusion, and license plate variation. As such, it requires training models on substantial volumes of relevant images per use case. In 2018, the new Mercosur standard came in to effect in four South American countries. Access to large volumes of actual Mercosur license plates with sufficient presentation variety is a significant challenge for training supervised models for LPD, thereby adversely impacting the efficacy of ALPR in Mercosur countries. This paper presents a novel license plate embedding methodology for generating large volumes of accurate Mercosur license plate images sufficient for training supervised LPD. We validate this methodology with a deep learning-based ALPR using a convolutional neural network trained exclusively with synthetic data and tested with real parking lot and traffic camera images. Experiment results achieve detection accuracy of 95% and an average running time of 40 ms. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {When designing and implementing visual sensor networks, mathematical models are frequently used to support better deployment strategies and quality assessment metrics in applications such as Smart Cities and Industry 4.0. However, the literature in this subject is not uniform and there are more than one way to model a visual sensor. This paper presents existing mathematical models and useful equations that can be employed when computing coverage, organizing and comparing them for different scenarios when analyzing coverage performance and computational costs. Moreover, a simulation scenario is defined considering a typical visual monitoring application in an industrial plant, presenting coverage results for different visual sensing models. Analyzing their mathematical costs, researchers can better decide which model and configuration parameters are more suitable for their needs, benefiting new works in this area.  © 2021 IEEE.},

In this context, the classification of Macrocauses can help governments better understand some aspects of public security related to the analysis of violent crimes in a state. In the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Norte (RN), these analyses are currently done by analyzing raw data done by an expert without any specific auxiliary system, known as traditional approaches. It is a time-consuming task, and different experts may have different views on the same case. With this in mind, in this work, we intend to assist these criminal experts by providing a predictive model that classifies the Macrocauses of crimes into a set of pre-defined types to guide the work of the experts and, as a consequence, to speed up the analysis and management processes. Thus, a feature preprocessing was performed in which three different classification techniques are analyzed. The results show that when using XGBoost, the model accuracy reached 0.932378, which is considered excellent for this application.  © 2021 IEEE.},

The Smart City Index (SCI) data can reach a higher quality of living by observing aspects as mobility, health, safety, transparency, smart management, and many others, like the waste management. Thus, this set of indicators was used to evaluate the e-waste management as an emergent challenge in urban cities, providing both, the generation of waste from the intense consumption of electronic devices, as well meeting the questions arising from urbanization from the integration of digital solutions. This study proposes a model of analysis using simple linear regression and k-mean clustering as correlation methods. The findings suggested correlation between the SCI ranking, the E-waste generated, and the economic situation of the entire set of smart cities. Nevertheless, it was found weak correlation for the best rated cities. The results provided the perception that it is possible to identify correlation from the Smart City Index and aspects from the e-waste management system, enabling the discussion over the importance of next smart city indexes and given a new perspective to the e-waste management.  © 2021 IEEE.},

However, due to the growth of number of devices, it becomes necessary to implement techniques to select most suitable sensors for each task. This approach is important to make possible to execute applications, where low latency requirements are present. Thus, several works were dedicated to the study on how to search, index, and rank sensors to overcome these challenges. A method, called GoAT, is presented in this paper to rank sensors based on the theory of active perception. The solution was evaluated using four real datasets. Our results successfully demonstrate that the proposal solution can provide an interesting level of reliability of the utilization of sensor data. Furthermore, GoAT requires a low computational resource, and at the same time, reduces latency in the sensor selection process.

Such vehicles, notably ambulances, fire trucks, police cars and transit agents vehicles, may be tracked and monitored in some applications for different functions. When such emergency vehicles are not equipped with GPS receivers, cameras can be used to view emergency signs printed on them, allowing indirect identification of emergency vehicles, although many complexities have to be considered when performing visual sensors-based tracking and monitoring. In this context, this paper proposes a mathematical model focused on the evaluation of the coverage efficiency of a group of visual sensors over moving vehicles, aimed at visual coverage of emergency signs. For that, vehicles, emergency signs and visual sensors are mathematically modelled in this paper, with coverage interactions among these elements being computed based on proposed geometry equations and algorithms. Doing so, the effectiveness of the positioning and configurations of visual sensors can be evaluated without requiring actual deployment, potentially reducing costs when assessing visual monitoring systems in this scenario.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) allows monitoring and automation in diverse contexts, such as hospitals, homes, or even smart cities, just to name a few examples. IoT data processing may occur, at the edge of the network or in the cloud, but frequently the processing must be divided between the two layers. Aiming to guarantee that the IoT systems works efficiently, it is essential to evaluate the system even in initial design stages. However, evaluating hybrid systems composed by multiple layers is not an easy task as a myriad of parameters are involved in the process. Thus, this paper presents two SPN models (one base and extended one) that can represent an abstract distributed system composed of IoT, edge and cloud layers. The models are highly configurable to be used in diverse simulation scenarios. Besides a sensitivity analysis evidenced the most impacting components in the studied architecture and made it possible to optimize the base SPN model. Finally a case study explores multiple metrics of interest concurrently and works as a guide of the model utilization. Ultimately, the proposed approach can assist system designers to avoid unnecessary investment in original equipment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

This paper presents a comprehensive literature review of 227 documents contextualizing outdoor lighting with SDGs, showing its potential to resolve some existing issues related to the SDG targets. From a list of 17 goals, six SDGs were identified to have relevant synergies with outdoor lighting in smart cities, including SDG 3 (Good health and well-being), SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities), SDG 14 (Life below water) and SDG 15 (Life on land). This review also links efficient lighting roles partially with SDG 7 (Affordable and clean energy) and SDG 13 (Climate action) through Target 7.3 and Target 13.2, respectively. This paper identifies outdoor lighting as a vector directly impacting 16 of the 50 targets in the six SDGs involved. Each section in this review discusses the main aspects of outdoor lighting by a human-centric, energy efficiency and environmental impacts. Each aspect addresses the most recent studies contributing to lighting solutions in the literature, helping us to understand the positive and negative impacts of artificial lighting on living beings. In addition, the work summarizes the proposed solutions and results tackling specific topics impacting SDG demands. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {The effective deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as smart cities, smart farming and smart transport systems must ensure the network robustness, scalability and longevity. Therefore, guaranteeing the successful delivery of information and extending the lifetime of the nodes that make up a wireless sensor network (WSN) are two essential aspects for IoT applications. This work evaluates the performance of a cooperative WSN by adopting two multiantenna schemes: antenna selection (AS) and beamforming transmission using the singular value decomposition (SVD) technique. In addition, cooperation is established according to an ON–OFF probability, so that the RF receiving circuits of the relays are activated in a probabilistic way, aiming at reducing the energy consumption of the sensors, extending their useful lifetime. Our main goal is to increase the amount of information effectively transmitted by the network, keeping an outage probability constraint. The results show that, when both techniques are used, there is a significant gain in the amount of information effectively transmitted by the network, with emphasis on the AS scheme at short transmission distances. By increasing the number of antennas, it was found that a lower ON–OFF probability is required, i.e., a trade-off is established between the nodes’ hardware complexity and their need for cooperation. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {This paper presents a new holistic approach that combines solutions for the future power systems. It describes clearly how solar energy is definitely the best outlet for a clean and sustainable planet, either due to their use in both vertical (V) or horizontal (H) forms such as: hydroelectric V&H, wind V&H, thermo‐oceanic V&H, water movement sea V&H (tides and waves), solar ther-moelectric, PV, and surface geothermal energy. New points of view and simple formulas are sug-gested to calculate the best characteristic intensity, storage means and frequency for specific places and how to manage the most well‐known renewable sources of energy. Future renewables‐based power system requires a huge amount of flexibility from different type and size of controllable energy resources. These flexible energy resources can be used in an aggregated manner to provide different ancillary services for the distribution and transmission network. In addition, flexible energy resources and renewable generation can be utilized in different kinds of energy communities and smart cities to benefit all stakeholders and society at the same time with future‐proof market structures, new business models and management schemes enabling increased utilization of flexible energy resources. Many of the flexible energy resources and renewable‐based generation units are also inverter‐interfaced and therefore the authors present future power converter systems for energy sources as well as the latest age of multilevel converters. © 2021 by the authors.

	abstract = {The rise of distributed sensors-based monitoring applications has allowed the gathering of important information in urban areas, strongly supporting the maturation of smart cities. In those scenarios, alternative transportation has been leveraged as viable solutions for the complex challenges of urban mobility, bringing cycling to a new setting. Actually, when assessing the quality of cycling paths, safety and quality parameters can be retrieved from distributed sensor nodes attached to bikes, allowing better perceptions of the adverse conditions faced by cyclists in modern cities. However, such IoT-based procedures require proper modelling of cycling paths, since quality parameters are expected to have spatiotemporal significance. Therefore, this paper discusses and proposes solutions for some important modelling and visualization issues related to the quality monitoring of cycle paths. Such solutions are concerned with the mathematical modelling of this problem, as well as the proposal of a generic computer-assisted solution to handle environmental parameters retrieved by sensors attached to bikes. Doing so, it is defined a uniform representation model and an expected data flow that can be exploited by any monitoring application in urban areas. As an important step in that direction, a reference implementation is described, allowing formal representation, structured processing and graphical visualization of bike-centric monitoring parameters, potentially supporting new developments in the area of smart cycling. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Surveillance monitoring systems are highly necessary, aiming to prevent many social problems in smart cities. The internet of things (IoT) nowadays offers a variety of technologies to capture and process massive and heterogeneous data. Due to the fact that (i) advanced analyses of video streams are performed on powerful recording devices; while (ii) surveillance monitoring services require high availability levels in the way that the service must remain connected, for example, to a connection network that offers higher speed than conventional connections; and that (iii) the trustworthy dependability of a surveillance system depends on various factors, it is not easy to identify which components/devices in a system architecture have the most impact on the dependability for a specific surveillance system in smart cities. In this paper, we developed stochastic Petri net models for a surveillance monitoring system with regard to varying several parameters to obtain the highest dependability. Two main metrics of interest in the dependability of a surveillance system including reliability and availability were analyzed in a comprehensive manner. The analysis results show that the variation in the number of long-term evolution (LTE)-based stations contributes to a number of nines (#9s) increase in availability. The obtained results show that the variation of the mean time to failure (MTTF) of surveillance cameras exposes a high impact on the reliability of the system. The findings of this work have the potential of assisting system architects in planning more optimized systems in this field based on the proposed models. © 2021 by the authors.

In addition, large, public datasets are made available on the Internet by open government programs, providing ways for citizens, NGOs, scientists, and public managers to perform a multitude of data analysis with the goal of better understanding the city dynamics to provide means for evidence-based public policymaking. However, it is challenging to visualize huge amounts of data from mobility datasets. Plotting raw trajectories on a map often causes data occlusion, impairing the visual analysis. Displaying the multiple attributes that these trajectories come with is an even larger challenge. One approach to solve this problem is trail bundling, which groups motion trails that are spatially close in a simplified representation. In this paper, we augment a recent bundling technique to support multi-attribute trail datasets for the visual analysis of urban mobility. Our case study is based on the travel survey from the São Paulo Metropolitan Area, which is one of the most intense traffic areas in the world. The results show that bundling helps the identification and analysis of various mobility patterns for different data attributes, such as peak hours, social strata, and transportation modes. © 2021, The Author(s).},

Due to the growing developments in digital technologies, Smart Cities have been equipped with different electronic devices based on IoT and several applications are being created for most diverse areas of knowledge making systems more efficient. However, Assistive technology is a field that is not enough explored in this scenario yet. In this work, an integrated framework with an IoT architecture customized for an electronic cane (electronic travel aid designed for the visually impaired) has been designed. The architecture is organized by a five-layer architecture: edge technology, gateway, Internet, middleware and application. This new feature brings the ability to connect to environment devices, receiving the coordinates of their geographic locations, alerting the user when it is close to anyone of these devices and sending those coordinates to a web application for smart monitoring. Preliminary studies and experimental tests with three blind users of the Cane show that this approach would contribute to get more spatial information from the environment improving mobility of visually impaired people. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Facing the increasing complexity of large urban centers caused by population growth and the dynamic nature of cities, their managers seek to optimize services and infrastructures in terms of scalability, environment, and security to adapt to demand, making their cities smarter. Therefore, these new modern centers’ administrators should apply smart governance techniques to manage the physical and data infrastructure and seek alignment with the global open data initiative. As a point of intersection between physical and data infrastructure, 3D models of cities have been playing an important role in people’s daily lives, being a fundamental element for several applications. In this context, CityGML, a semantic model for 3D data representation adopted by several cities, appears as a possible solution for modeling. This paper presents an approach of integrating open data in the semi-automatic generation of 3D models based on CityGML, “enriching” semantic information about the instances with the association with the OpenStreetMaps database. A case study was performed using data provided by the Municipality of Porto Alegre, BR. The model generated in CityGML goes through semantic, geometric, and schema level validations, proving the proposed approach’s feasibility.

	abstract = {From its emergence to the present day, traffic light control systems have been widely used to monitor and control the flow of vehicles. However, with the increasing number of public (bus) and private vehicles (car, motorcycle, and truck), urban centers are becoming more and more populous. Such phenomenon leads to traffic congestion and increases environmental and noise pollution. In order to stem the rise of such problems, large cities are adopting technological solutions, materializing the concept of smart cities. While observing traffic management systems themselves, several hardware and software solutions have been studied and implemented around the world. This article aims to contribute to traffic signals improvement by developing a centralized traffic light control system, using a unique wireless communication network. In order to prove the system's effectiveness, the most common types of urban intersections were analyzed. Direct control routines were implemented for network traffic lights, providing a complete control system for extraordinary events, such as closing roads due to accidents or public events. Finally, safety routines were formulated to report the operating status of the traffic light system lamps to a central management. With the aid of a logic analyzer connected to the outputs for each focal group, it was possible to set up an operating stages timing diagram of each traffic light. Thus, the system validation was achieved based on theoretical and practical timing diagrams similarities. © 2014 IEEE.},

This paper proposes a task optimization mechanism based on the meta-heuristic algorithm of the Grey Wolf Optimizer, called TOVEC. It aims to improve the usage of the available resources in a VC and maximizing task allocation. Simulation results showed that the TOVEC increases the number of tasks served by up to 34.2%, maximizes the use of resources by up to 21.5%, and improves the allocation reward by up to 24.7% compared to Greedy and Dynamic Programming (DP) methods. © 2021 IEEE},

	abstract = {Digital technologies are changing the way people interact with the world. The Digital Twin (DT) is one of the key enablers of Industry 4.0. It provides a virtual representation of an observable element of the real world. These elements can be both physical objects such as devices or non-physical such as interactions and processes. Digitalization of the real world enables new business models, transforming traditional products into services, as for instance, the Car-as-a-Service (CaaS). To integrate all components that will be part of systems like CaaS or Smart Cities, it is necessary to have well-defined standards for modeling and defining an architecture especially taking into consideration the granularity level of the system. This paper proposes the main components needed for building DT-based systems with different levels of granularity. These components have been arranged in layers to specify the concerns of each part of the system. A case study has been developed to demonstrate the modeling and the deployment of the Digital Twin, highlighting how this concept can be one of the key enablers for CaaS. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This article aims to advance the debate on gender and smart cities. Smart cities, with technology as a basic component in urban management, are initiatives seen as a path towards sustainability and inclusiveness. Discussed by academics and practitioners to promote better living in urban spaces, gender issues have been neglected when studying and designing smart cities. Gender (in)equalities affect women's and men's lives in many ways, which include the different experiences and unequal situations in cities. By failing to address gender issues, urban spaces can potentially exacerbate inequalities. Additionally, disregarding gender issues through gender-blind policies does not make cities neutral but rather gendered only for a universal Subject. Based on a systematic and integrative literature review, we sought to answer the research question: Why gender shoud be considered when studying and designing smart cities? In addition to addressing the question, the intersectionality approach is presented as a means to promote gendered smart cities.  © 2021 ACM.},

	abstract = {The current trend of the modern smart cities applications towards a continuous increase in the volume of produced data and the concurrent need for low and predictable latency in the response time has motivated the shift from a cloud to a fog computing approach. A fog computing architecture is likely to represent a preferable solution to reduce the application latency and the risk of network congestion by decreasing the volume of data transferred to cloud data centers. However, the design of a fog infrastructure opens new issues concerning not only how to allocate the data flow coming from sensors to fog nodes and from there to cloud data centers, but also the choice of the number and the location of the fog nodes to be activated among a list of potential candidates. We model this facility location issue through a multi-objective optimization problem. We propose a heuristic based on the variable neighborhood search, where neighborhood structures are based on swap and move operations. The proposed method is tested in a wide range of scenarios, considering a smart city application’s realistic setup with geographically distributed sensors. The experimental evaluation shows that our method can achieve stable and better performance concerning other literature approaches, supporting the given application. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The growth of the Internet of Things (IoT) led to the deployment of many applications that use wireless networks, like smart cities and smart agriculture. Low Power Wide Area Networks (LPWANs) meet many requirements of IoT, such as energy efficiency, low cost, large coverage area, and large-scale deployment. Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) networks are one of the most studied and implemented LPWAN technologies, due to the facility to build private networks with an open standard. Typical LoRaWAN networks are single-hop in a star topology, composed of end-devices that transmit data directly to gateways. Recently, several studies proposed multihop LoRaWAN networks, thus forming wireless mesh networks. This article provides a review of the state-of-the-art multihop proposals for LoRaWAN. In addition, we carried out a comparative analysis and classification, considering technical characteristics, intermediate devices function, and network topologies. This paper also discusses open issues and future directions to realize the full potential of multihop networking. We hope to encourage other researchers to work on improving the performance of LoRaWAN mesh networks, with more theoretical and simulation analysis, as well as practical deployments. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {In Smart Cities, the city's IT infrastructure must facilitate the development, deployment and operation of smart city applications for a number of different application domains that need to access a variety of heterogeneous resources. Building these applications becomes a great challenge since: they are used on large scale systems, have dynamic behavior, must access heterogeneous resources, can share resources from different domains, and must deal with the semantics of different domains. In this sense, platforms are commonly used to support application development, but they do not reduce complexity, are generic and deal with resource abstractions, while applications deal with domain abstractions. To overcome this semantic gap, this work proposes the use of domain specific middleware (DSM) with support for the development of model-driven applications defined in terms of a domain specific modeling language (DSML). To facilitate the definition of languages in different domains and, consequently, the execution of applications built according to these languages, a meta-meta language was defined that wraps the generic concepts used for the management of several domains. Furthermore, operational semantics are represented by models that describe domain-specific operations. The set of these elements associated with a middleware built according to the model-driven approach is defined as Model-Driven Domain-Specific Middleware (MDDSM). Therefore, this work proposes an integrated architecture that combines the use of MD-DSM and a smart cities platform to provide a flexible, robust and complete approach to facilitating the creation and execution of applications for different smart city domains. Thus, in the context of Smart Cities, middleware must deal with both application domain-related abstractions and platform-related abstractions (resources). Furthermore, the use of the model-driven approach allows representing such abstractions and relating domain semantics to generic resources. As a result, we have the construction of middleware and related elements in different domains and associated with a smart cities platform, demonstrating the expressiveness of the proposed approach. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Internet of Things devices are responsible for collecting and transmitting data in smart cities, assisting smart cities to release greater potential. As Internet of Things devices are increasingly connected to smart cities, security and privacy have gradually become important issues. Recently, research works on mitigating security challenges of Internet of Things devices in smart cities mainly focused on authentication. However, in most of the existing authentication protocols, the trustworthiness evaluation of Internet of Things devices in smart cities is ignored. Considering the trustworthiness evaluation of Internet of Things devices is an important constituent of data source authentication, in this article, a cloud-aided trustworthiness evaluation mechanism is first designed to improve the credibility of the Internet of Things devices in smart cities. Furthermore, aiming at the problem that the user’s privacy is easy to leak in the process of authentication, an anonymous authentication and key agreement scheme based on non-interactive zero knowledge argument is proposed. The proposed scheme can ensure the privacy preservation and data security of Internet of Things devices in smart cities. The security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme is secure under q-SDH problem. The experimental simulation indicates that the performance of the proposal is greatly improved compared with other similar schemes. © The Author(s) 2021.},

These are all important components of an ecosystem that offers a better quality of life to society. However, to develop systems to be part of the smart city, it is necessary to understand the challenges and opportunities involved on it, especially the informal systems that are used by citizens and do not belong to the formal structure of public administration. Informal systems are created to meet the needs of citizens. As such, this work aims to present challenges and opportunities identified in this scenario. The method adopted to increase information on this topic was an online survey research. As a result, “transport” was highlighted as the most cited opportunity and “lack of investment” as the most cited challenge to be overcome according to the participants. As a contribution, a discussion about the results is carried out and allows the analysis of the identified opportunities and challenges so that professionals can take advantage and develop systems that citizens recognize as necessary to make a smart city. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Large cities are paying a lot of attention to the dramatic challenges resulted from increasing air pollution and the global warming, struggling to find new promising solutions to face them. As a result, alternative transportation in urban areas has been sought, trying to reduce urban pollution while also addressing mobility issues in crowded cities. Actually, although bikes have been considered as a promising resource for more efficient and cleaner urban mobility, there are several concerns that must be considered when using bike paths already implemented in urban areas. In fact, some environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, noise pollution, ultraviolet radiation and light intensity can bring several problems to the health of cyclists who are constantly exposed to them, thus requiring constant and historical analysis of these conditions. In this context, this paper proposes an environmental monitoring system based on low-cost mobile sensors-based devices attached to bikes, which allow the identification of the most recommended areas for cycling in relation to possible damage to the health of cyclists. For that, the electronic components chosen for the construction of those devices must be highly accessible and affordable, supporting large-scale development. Additionally, the proposed approach is based on a hybrid communication model that does not require any urban communication infrastructure, easing its practical exploitation. The proposed approach seeks then to provide better support to governments when assessing the conditions of the currently installed bike paths and also when planning the implementation of new paths, potentially bringing important contributions to the management of modern cities.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The adoption of sensors-based monitoring approaches has opened up a range of possibilities for data recovery, distributed processing, and quality evaluations in urban scenarios. In this evolving scenario, efficient emergency management systems provides a fundamental service for modern cities, exploiting different sensing and processing technologies for the real-time handling of critical situations. Actually, such systems are expected to implement emergency detection, alerting and mitigation services in order to avoid or relieve the negative impacts of critical events on the inhabitants' perceived quality of life. In this sense, after a critical event is properly detected, emergency vehicles may be dispatched as quickly as possible to respond to such detected situations, potentially reducing the probability of deaths and injuries. Therefore, this paper proposes a selection algorithm to dispatch emergency vehicles in smart cities, assuming that emergency alerts are dynamically released exploiting any support system. Then, dispatched vehicles are prioritized as they move on a city, by optimizing the operation of traffic lights. Such an optimization approach is implemented and evaluated using different simulation tools and programming libraries, providing important contributions to emergency management in smart cities. © 2021 IEEE.},

In this study, we propose a framework to evaluated changes in the environmental quality of forest fragments using open-access satellite data. The environmental quality of forest fragments was obtained using landscape ecology analysis and the prediction of future scenarios by Markov Chain Analysis and Celular Automata. We demonstrate this framework using a location that comprises an environmental preservation area, the JundiaíMirim river basin, containing the remnants of Atlantic forest near the Saõ Paulo state capital, southeast of Brazil. The results showed a constant trend of deterioration in the environmental quality of natural vegetation, attributed to the intense occupation process of urbanization in the watershed. The proposed methodology showed great potential to prevent the deterioration of urban forests, allowing the understanding of driving factors and disturbance dynamic in forest fragments. The locations of very low environmental quality proved to be the most vulnerable to the occupation process, highlighting the need of actions to preserve the Atlantic forest in Jundiaí-Mirim river basin.  © 2020 IEEE.},

Automatic Drone Identification (ADI) is a protection mechanism to detect and avoid malicious drones, where different techniques have been used, such as acoustic signals. In this field, the sound generated by propellers and motors has particular characteristics, being a potential aspect to explore; however, this investigation is still missing. This study examines the use of rhythm-based descriptors as input features to ADI, based on the hypothesis that the acoustic signal generated by different drones has different rhythmic properties. Aiming to explore and validate our approach, we formulate an ADI methodology using rhythm-based features. We use a freely available drone audio dataset, comparing our results with a baseline study. As a result, our classification model improves 3.47% the baseline binary classification and 2.97% the multiclass classification, reaching accuracy rates of 0.9985 and 0.9591, respectively. Although the improvements are narrow, they point out that acoustic features have a great potential to enhance ADI mainly in dense drone-based environments, where drone identification is an essential task.  © 2021 IEEE.},

The development of highly accurate machine learning models is yet harder when considering the optimization of hyperparameters, which is an expensive computational task. To tackle these challenges this work proposes the Distributed Evolutionary Hyperparameter Optimization (DEHO) for the Weighted Multivariate Fuzzy Time Series method (WMVFTS), a simple and non-parametric forecasting method with high scalability and accuracy, comprising a sequential training and forecasting procedure and a MapReduce extension for distributed processing. The proposed methods were evaluated using a cluster with commodity hardware and two big time series, showing increasing speed up for training and test times as new CPU cores are added to cluster. Then the DEHO method was executed in the computational cluster, achieving fast convergence and feasible processing time and generating highly accurate WMVFTS models.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart ecosystems combine various heterogeneous and independent software-intensive systems to enable complex functional-ities for highly dynamic smart applications, such as Industry 4.0, smart cities, transportation, automotive, and many other critical domains. Due to their complex nature, such ecosystems, which are often referred as to Systems-of-Systems (SoS), should be completely reliable and work without interruption or failures that could cause serious losses and damages. During the smart-ecosystem architectural design, the impact of eventual failures or architectural changes should then be predicted to avoid potential losses or damages. This tutorial presents a simulation-based approach to support the prediction, at design time, of the structure and behavior of smart-ecosystem architectures (which are inherently dynamic at runtime), aiming to evaluate whether the smart ecosystems can sustain their operation. To do that, we present the foundations and concepts associated with smart ecosystems/SoS and simulation, as well as the results of our multiple studies. We also offer hands-on experience in the simulation of software architectures, using artifacts associated with a pre-specified smart-ecosystem architecture and a free commercial simulator. We share with the European Conference on Software Architecture (ECSA 2021) audience the theoretical knowledge and practical experience that could leverage the adoption of simulation approaches during the development of software-intensive systems, in particular, those so complex and dynamic as smart ecosystems. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

With this in mind, the combination of information technology and sensors capable of capturing and sharing energy data with other devices can help solve power consumption problems. However, large volumes of these data are collected and stored uninterrupted, becoming a challenge to analyze it to confirm trends, identify hidden patterns, and outliers to aid in decision-making. As an alternative to address the issue, this paper presents an interactive visual analytics system to understand energy data coming from a smart building or city. This system provides ways to analyze the data at different levels of time granularities for the identification of energy trends, patterns, and data outliers. Moreover, it combines different algorithms that allow fulfilling predictive analysis. An analysis with domain experts demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of using the system to monitor energy data.  © 2020 IEEE.},

Among these applications, we can highlight smart city, smart farms, smart campus and applications in health and industry. The technologies belonging to the IoT, LoRa is one of the most used due to its wide range and high number of sensors in the network. This work uses this technology in order to optimize the physical layer parameter, spread factor (SF), in order to adapt the LoRa channel to variations in the environment, mobile nodes, and to plan links between the LoRa node and gateway. Through the conditions for receiving the packages, the SF variation increases the probability of receiving the packages. To determine the best SF based on the channel conditions, we propose a fuzzy logic initially with input parameters: RSSI and SNR, with the possible SF values output in the range 7 to 12.

Even though hundreds of cities around the world offer some form of Wi-Fi access, there are no widely available results regarding the network Quality of Service (QoS), user Quality of Experience (QoE), and overall utilization profile. The Municipality of São Paulo operates a free Wi-Fi Internet program in 120 public spaces called digital squares. We collected user connection data, network performance, and service availability for more than 2 years from the 120 squares and undertook experiments with video streaming in five squares. We used this unique large dataset to evaluate the impact of current admission control practices in public Wi-Fi networks on the network QoS, user QoE and service availability, also providing insights into the most common QoS/QoE issues and their causes. We also leveraged the data set to establish and verify a correlation between the number of users access in the network and specific events occurring in the area. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Deep learning offers precise information almost all the time when compared to other learning algorithms. On the other hand, the popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) has increased in various areas such as Smart City, Oil Mining, and Transportation. Edge/Fog computing environment helps to handle significant challenges faced by the IoT, viz. latency, bandwidth consumption, and everlasting network connectivity. For analytics in Edge computing, which is distributed in nature, the trend is more towards distributed machine learning. This research work is focused on the integration of data flow and distributed deep learning in the IoT-Edge environment to bring down the latency and increase accuracy starting from the data generation phase. To this end, a novel Data Flow and Distributed Deep Neural Network (DF-DDNN) based IoT-Edge model for big data environment has been proposed.

It is possible to note in the literature that the domains areas are not yet consolidated for structuring the dimensions of a smart city. In this article, the main idea is to describe the extension of a SysML profile to model dimensions of smart cities as native elements of system design. The profile extension, named SmartCitySysML, has been extended from SysML Internal Block Definition diagrams. The conception of this extension arose from the need to think about different dimensions to separate interests and to improve the focus on problem-solving. As a result, the SmartCitySysML profile facilitates the use of common elements of smart cities and provides a visual representation to evaluate the quality of diagrams from a practical point of view, as it provides using common terminology well-known by the stakeholders that are responsible for managing a variety of aspects of a smart city. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

In this concept, a smart city project involves planning, implementing and controlling good practices to obtain value from government investments and to provide better services to citizens. Consequently, an ICT governance approach represents a relevant outcome to evaluate, direct and monitor smart city initiatives to achieve cities' objectives. Considering that COBIT5 is a well-known IT governance framework for organizations of any kind, this work investigated COBIT5 application in smart cities context. By developing a Systematic Literature Review, it was revealed that, so far, COBIT5 framework fundamentals were poorly applied to smart city governance context. Therefore, through exploratory research, this paper proposes a roadmap approach to integrate COBIT5 governance requirements as a strategic ICT driver for smart city government initiatives. The results can be used by cities' governments and IT practitioners to implement ICT governance practices in smart cities context. © 2020 ACM.},

Among such possibilities, emergencies management is expected to play an important role in how modern cities will evolve, reducing the negative impacts of critical events and improving the quality of life perceived by their inhabitants. Actually, when an emergency is detected and alerted, emergency vehicles, notably ambulances, fire trucks, police cars and transit agents vehicles, should be quickly assigned to respond to that situation, as soon as possible. In this context, we propose a dynamic algorithm to automatically assign emergency vehicles in smart city scenarios, exploiting for that a sensors-based emergency detection system to provide emergency alerts. The proposed algorithm can then be used to quickly assign a number of emergency vehicles in the first moments of an emergency, which can potentially save lives and improve existing crisis management applications in smart cities.  © 2020 IEEE.},

These services can improve life quality, minimize environmental impacts, improve health service, improve security, and bear the increasing number of people in the cities. Life quality encompasses many subjects, and accessibility for People with Disabilities (PwD) is one. In this article, smart cities focused on helping PwD are called Assistive Smart Cities (ASCs). In this sense, the article proposes a Model for Assistive Smart Cities called MASC. Related works do not cover geographically broad areas, such as cities and metropolitan regions. Moreover, they are not generic in terms of disabilities and are usually intended only for one type of disability. Given this scenario, the MASC covers large regions and supports various disabilities, such as hearing, visual impairment, and limitation of lower limb movements. Unlike the related works, MASC uses the interactions of PwD to compose histories of contexts offered as services. MASC proposes an ontology-based on ubiquitous accessibility concepts. The model evaluation focused on performance, functionality, and usability. Performance and functionality evaluations were performed using data generated by a context simulator called Siafu and data from the Open Street Maps (OSM) platform. Usability was evaluated using a smart wheelchair prototype. The results of usability show 96% acceptance regarding ease of use and 98% regarding system utility. The results indicate that the model supports massive applications, managing information to generate trails. Besides, MASC provides services for different types of users, namely PwD, healthcare professionals, and public administration.  © 2021-IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

Mobile apps have played an unprecedented role during this pandemic to enable citizens to participate and interact with social issues while raising concerns about privacy and surveillance. In a partnership of the Natal smart city initiative of the university and the public ministry, we deployed the 'Tô de Olho' (TdO) platform for integrating different sectors of society against coronavirus spreading in the state of RN, Brazil. In less than four months, TdO reached more than 20,000 users with several user roles, functionalities and a strictly defined privacy policy. Location data allows TdO to notify users when they have possible suspicious contact with an infected person or have gone through virus hot zones. The platform also helps city health officials to select people for infectious testing, according to user information on symptoms, comorbid diseases, contact with infected people, risk status and QR health code. Our integration with private institutions enables employers to know which employees have tested positive to protect work environments. We discuss the partnerships involved with TdO's deployment and compare our context with related apps around the world, suggesting that public scrutiny, government investments and integration with active applications in the city are essential to achieving massive use. Further, we evaluate the feedback of active users (N=175), analyzing the positive points and advising improvements for future work on participatory applications during an epidemic.  © 2020 IEEE.},

One emerging application in this scenario is Platooning, a stable stream of connected autonomous vehicles. This application improves safety, vehicle flow on the road, energy consumption, among other variables. However, vehicles using this technology need to share space with vehicles not connected or with other automation levels. Among the bottlenecks in scenarios like this, Platoons formation and splits stand out, as these maneuvers involve costs and risk. Therefore, our contribution is developing a new strategy for Platoons formationin a mixed universe of vehicles to bring some of these desired benefits. The results show that the proposed solution achieved an accuracy of 89% of the entire amount of platoons in the datasets. Ourexperiments demonstrate cases with collisions, and the proposed solution provides a solution to a more safe operation on roads. Finally, we conclude that our solution provides more determinism in the traffic conditions, as vehicles achieving stationary speeds with low variation.  © 2013 IEEE.},

We evaluated an ITS application in three different scenarios: in the cloud using a 4G connection, in the cloud using broadband, and in MEC. We compare scenarios using quantitative metrics such as requests per second, average response time, and request loss rate. The experimental results indicate that MEC has a lower loss of requests and it can work with a greater number of requests per second, which makes it a good solution for ITS applications.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart city services are typically defined according to domains (e.g., health, education, safety) and supported by different systems. Consequently, the analysis of smart city data is often domain-specific, thus limiting the capabilities of the offered services and hampering decision-making that relies on isolated domain information. To support a suitable analysis across multiple domains, it is necessary having a unified data model able to handle the inherent heterogeneity of smart city data and take into account both geographic and citizen information. This paper presents an ontology-based information model to support multi-domain analysis in smart cities to foster interoperability and powerful automated reasoning upon unambiguous information. The proposed information model follows Linked Data principles and takes advantage of ontologies to define information semantically. The semantic relationships and properties defined in the model also allow inferring new pieces of information that improve accuracy when analyzing multiple city domains. This paper reports an evaluation of the information model through ontological metrics and competence questions. © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {Breaking boundaries in transistor technology has allowed the increase in the number of cores within a single chip. This, in turn, enables High-Performance Computing (HPC) systems with better capabilities to exploit thread-level parallelism (TLP). However, this also leads to unforeseen issues related to the temperature of these systems. Reaching high temperatures speeds up the aging process of hardware components by influencing their causes (e.g., negative bias temperature instability-NBTI), and that is not only dependent on the number of cores, but also the distance between them and their usage. On top of that, parallel applications present various patterns, such as irregularity, unbalanced computations, or high rates of communications. These different characteristics may accentuate such adverse effects. Given these considerations, we propose the aging-Aware thread scheduling (AATS) optimization strategy that automatically finds the ideal combination of TLP exploitation and thread allocation strategy to execute applications with a key objective: improve the trade-off between performance and processor aging so the number of times an application may execute until the processor's end-of-life is maximized. With the execution of thirteen well-known benchmarks on three different multicore architectures, we demonstrate that AATS converges to an ideal or near-ideal solution spending only 4.74% of the time spent by a design space exploration that tries all possible combinations. We also show that processor lifetime can be significantly extended when running applications with the solution found by AATS. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is believed to bring new unprecedented development to our society and will impact and enable new, more powerful applications in many areas. When considering Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), there is potential to enhance applications in emergency response situations, smart cities, industry and others. UAVs are expected to provide and consume services as one of the things in the IoT environment. However, the intrinsic IoT heterogeneity regarding devices, platforms, and communication protocols makes the task of service provision and management much harder to be done in the application layer. In previous work, we have presented how HAMSTER can enable secure service provision using the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol with enhanced security. In this paper, we show how HAMSTER deals with service management and exchange with minimum effort from the application. We introduce the Service Exchange Operator (SEO) in HAMSTER and present preliminary results. Keywords - Drone, UAV, IoT, Services, HAMSTER.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The growing aging of the world’s population along with several environmental, social and economic factors, end up posing major challenges for public health. One challenge is the detection and treatment of high cost patients, i.e., a small percentage of patients associated with majority of expenditures in healthcare. The early detection of patients who may become high cost in the future can be used to better target interventions focusing on preventing their transition or, in the case of those who are already in such condition, to allow appropriate approaches, rather than generic ones. In both cases, the detection of such patients can be beneficial, reducing avoidable costs and improving patients’ condition. In order to make such detection, this work has focused on using deep learning techniques, specifically, Neural Networks, along with a dataset composed of survey answers applied by the United States government, called Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and attributes gathered from the literature. For the purposes of this work, 11 years of the MEPS dataset were considered, including the years from 2006 to 2016. The models created have shown results ranging between 83 % to 90 % on metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, specificity and f1-score. This work also aimed to make the creation and testing of such networks easier, by providing the tools developed during its evolution on GitHub. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The adoption of emergency alerting systems can bring countless benefits when managing urban areas, industrial plants, farms, roads and virtually any area that is subject to the occurrence of critical events, supporting in rescue operations and reducing their negative impacts. For such systems, a promising approach is to exploit scalar sensors to detect events of interest, allowing for the distributed monitoring of different variables. However, the use of cameras as visual sensors can enhance the detection of critical events, which can be employed along with scalar sensors for a more comprehensive perception of the environment. Although the particularities of visual sensing may be challenging in some scenarios, the combination of scalar and visual sensors for the early detection of emergency situations can be valuable for many scenarios, such as smart cities and industry 4.0, bringing promising results. Therefore, in this article, we extend a sensors-based emergency detection and alerting system to also exploit visual monitoring when identifying critical events. Implementation and experimental details are provided to reinforce the use of cameras as a relevant sensor unit, bringing promising results for emergencies management. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In recent years, the domain of applications and information systems for Smart Cities (SC) has emerged and motivated researchers and practitioners to develop relevant solutions. The development of applications for SC involves many specificities, such as: (i) processing and analysis of large volumes of data; (ii) context-awareness; (iii) perception and actuation on physical elements of the city; and (iv) maintaining citizens' privacy and security. It is important to ensure that these specificities have an adequate level of quality that enables the daily use of these applications in these cities. However, there is still no consolidated set of properties and / or characteristics that should be considered when evaluating the quality of this specific type of application. The goal of this work is to identify the characteristics and sub-characteristics of product quality that are being considered in the evaluation of applications and information systems in the context of SC. To do this, a Mapping Study was conducted, aiming to present an overview of the current state of the art in product quality for this context. Additionally, an analysis was carried out between the product quality characteristics of the ISO / IEC 25010: 2011 model with the characteristics identified in this mapping. As a result, eight related works, which deal with characteristics, such as Reliability, Compatibility, Maintenance, and Safety have been identified. Finally, there is a need for more detailed specifications of characteristics that enable the quality assurance of SC applications. © 2020 ACM.},

Focused efforts to improve the energy efficiency of buildings have been and will be even more essential to achieve desired sustainability goals. The energy benchmarking enables an understanding of the relative energy efficiency of buildings and identifying potential energy saving opportunities. In this sense, this paper aims to develop an energy performance benchmark for office buildings using data mining techniques that have been widely used in literature, showing robustness and reliability results. Specifically, we used techniques such as a wrapper model based on regression analysis for feature selection and the K-prototypes algorithm for classifying buildings. The key idea is to cluster the buildings containing mixed-type data (both numeric and categorical) and establish a benchmarking in each group according to the relative significance (weight) of each building. As a result, eight types of energy benchmarks were developed for each cluster of office buildings, and these were validated in terms of Adjusted R-squared. The results showed that the proposed approach outperformed the Energy Star method by 18%.  © 2020 IEEE.},

In this work, we present an intelligent fall-detection system based on IoT to monitor the elderly with your privacy-protected. Currently, fall detection has attracted significant research attention and deep learning has shown promising performance in this task using conventional cameras. However, these traditional methods pose a risk of the leakage of personal privacy. This work proposes a novel fall-detection system that uses a continuous-wave Doppler radar sensor to acquisition the elderly movements and sends this information thought the internet to a server with deep learning using a convolutional neural network (CNN) that identifies the fall. The radar sensor is inexpensive, completely camera-free, and collects no personally identifiable information, thereby allaying privacy concerns. Additionally, unlike traditional cameras, it has environmental robustness and dark/light-independence. The proposed system obtained 99.9% accuracy in detecting falls by using the GoogleNet convolutional neural network. The proposed system is also capable of detecting other types of movements in addition to those tested, including the detection of diseases such as COVID-19 through the cough movement.  © 2020 IEEE.},

In order to serve IoT data collected across different locations, the MSP dynamically negotiates and rescales bandwidth and service functions. 5G network slicing functions are key to lease appropriate amount of resources over heterogeneous access technologies and different site types. Also, different infrastructure providers will charge slicing service depending on specific access technology supported across regional sites and IoT data collection patterns.We introduce a pricing mechanism based on Age of Information (AoI) to reduce the cost of MSPs. It provides incentives for devices to smooth traffic by shifting part of the traffic load from highly congested and more expensive locations to lesser charged ones, while meeting QoS requirements of the IoT service. The proposed optimal pricing scheme comprises a two-stage decision process, where the MSP determines the pricing of each location and devices schedule uploads of collected data based on the optimal uploading policy. Simulations show that the MSP attains consistent cost reductions tuning the trade-off between slicing costs and the AoI of uploaded IoT data. © 2020 ITC Press.},

	abstract = {Context: Smart Cities and other Systems-of-Systems (SoS) have attracted attention due to their potential for innovation in the services provided to the society. SoS are composed of several independent systems and often support critical domains. As such, failures can cause serious damage or even financial losses that can be avoided by performing quality assurance (QA). Among QA techniques, software testing is an essential activity that checks software behaviors against a subset of parameters. However, testing SoS can be even more complex since several other factors further elevate the complexity of the test, such as interoperability links and multiple independent systems. Goal: Our goal in this paper is to analyze the current state of research on software testing for SoS domain. Method: A protocol was formulated and executed according to the guidelines for performing systematic literature mappings in Software Engineering. Results: This study identified the tools, approaches, methods and processes that the literature has addressed to test SoS. Conclusions: Software Testing for SoS still faces several problems and presents many questions to be answered, particularly in the definition of processes and metrics.  © 2020 ACM.},

The goal of the app is that users are notified if they were in contact with others infected. It also allows creating a heat map identifying streets, squares, and commercial locations to which contaminated users were, allowing more assertive hygiene actions and eliminating infectious disease outbreaks. Our methodology aimed on finding whether people would be willing to share their location, as well as their health issues related to COVID-19. It is composed by a survey for verifying the interest of the proposed application; the prototype of the application; and the use of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). We can see that the vast majority of respondents to the first survey were interested in using a contact tracking application, even though they need to share their location and report when they become infected. In addition, the proposed RISCOVID application proved to be accepted for use by participants in the second survey.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Vehicular networks are mobile networks designed for the domain of vehicles and pedestrians. These networks are an essential component of intelligent transportation systems and have the potential to ease traffic management, lower accident rates, and offer other solutions to smart cities. One of the most challenging aspects in the design of a vehicular network is the distribution of its infrastructure units, which are called roadside units (RSUs). In this work, we tackle the gamma deployment problem that consists of deploying the minimum number of RSUs in a vehicular network in accordance with a quality of service metric called gamma deployment. This metric defines a vehicle as covered if it connects to some RSUs at least once in a given time interval during its whole trip. Then, the metric parameterizes the minimum percentage of covered vehicles necessary to make a deployment acceptable or feasible. In this paper, we prove that the decision version of the gamma deployment problem in grids is NP-complete. Moreover, we correct the multiflow integer linear programming formulation present in the literature and introduce a new formulation based on set covering that is at least as strong as the multiflow formulation. In experiments with a commercial solver, the set covering formulation widely outperforms the multiflow formulation with respect to running time and linear programming relaxation gap. © 2019 The Authors.

Digital technologies (DTs) have demonstrated a potential synergy to achieve circular goals at the micro, meso, and macro-level. Although several studies in literature explore DTs and CE linkage, they have not been identified according to their primary research themes. This paper aims to identify the main research streams addressing CE and DTs. From a Systematic Literature Review and Content Analysis, we reviewed 40 articles and classified three primary research streams. (1) Industry 4.0 (I4.0) focuses on the relevance and role of I4.0 in the transition to a CE. (2) The Business research stream evaluated the connection between digital transformation and business. (3) The Sustainability research stream discusses sustainability issues such as waste management and smart cities. Based on the analyzed studies' purposes and gaps, we provide a research agenda for further research. Additionally, we explain the implications of DTs and CE to research on engineering design. Our paper guides researchers in their future research to focus on gaps that have not been answered and position their studies according to their research streams. © ICED 2021.All right reserved.},

To support these applications, different blockchain architectures, data structures and consensus algorithms have been proposed, tailored to IoT. One such proposal, appendable-block blockchain, is a promising blockchain framework for use in IoT environments. It provides a scalable data structure that allows parallel insertions between independent nodes. However, it has some limitations, in particular related to the possible eclipse attack by malicious gateways and the lack of consensus for transactions insertion. To solve these issues, we propose a new consensus mechanism for appendable-block blockchains, called context-based consensus. Using context-based consensus, information can be inserted in parallel across devices (called context) while ensuring that light-weight consensus is performed to guarantee that a transaction is well-formed and it is placed in the correct order. We implemented context-based consensus and show that using multiple contexts reduces latency and increases the throughput of transaction insertions when compared to consensus without contexts or using single transaction consensus.  © 2020 IEEE.},

Despite increasing efforts to maximize the vehicle flow in large cities, to provide greater accuracy to estimate the traffic jam and to maximize the flow of vehicles in the transport infrastructure, without increasing the overhead of information on the control-related network, still consist in issues to be investigated. Therefore, using artificial intelligence method, we propose a solution of inter-vehicle communication for estimating the congestion level to maximize the vehicle traffic flow in the transport system, called TRAFFIC. For this, we modeled an ensemble of classifiers to estimate the congestion level using TRAFFIC. Hence, the ensemble classification is used as an input to the proposed dissemination mechanism, through which information is propagated between the vehicles. By comparing TRAFFIC with other studies in the literature, our solution has advanced the state of the art with new contributions as follows: (i) increase in the success rate for estimating the traffic congestion level; (ii) reduction in travel time, fuel consumption and CO2 emission of the vehicle; and (iii) high coverage rate with higher propagation of the message, maintaining a low packet transmission rate. © 2020},

Such participation, which is seen as social, is considered an essential element for the design of a smart city. This study aims to identify the factors that contribute to social participation in the definition of budgetary instruments’ planning. Design/methodology/approach: Concerning the methodological instruments, this study is characterised by a quantitative and descriptive approach and uses a multivariate data analysis with a sample of 235 respondents. Findings: The study’s findings identified a framework that portrays elements that collaborate with the social participation in the definition of the public administration’s budgetary instruments, which are considered as elements that are able to develop the role of the popular participation and are characterised by the definition of a smart city by enabling more assertiveness in society’s needs. Practical implications: Identification of a framework that brings out elements that are able to develop the popular participation in the definition of budgetary instruments. Then, one scale of elements that contribute to social participation in the definition of the public administration’s budgetary instruments theoretically represented and statistically validated, thus contributing to the continuity of studies on social participation. Social implications: Through studies on social participation in budgetary planning, it is possible to guarantee a better allocation of public resources through intelligent governability. Originality/value: The research can bring theoretical elements about social participation in the definition of budget instruments for a statistical convergence through the perception of the sample. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {High crime rates have become a public health problem in many important cities, according to World Health Organization. Many researchers have been developing algorithms to predict crime occurrences to tackle this problem. The smart cities' environment can provide us enough ubiquitous data, e.g., traffic flow, human mobility, and Points of Interest (POI) information, to feed those predictive policing algorithms and reflect city dynamics. POIs data provide essential information such as geographical location, category, customer reviews, and busy hours. Recent studies have shown that POI geographical locations are useful for predictive policing. In this paper, we aim at predicting crimes in a delimited region around the POIs of a city with new environmental features. We investigate the relevance of POIs location and the semantic and the temporal features from POIs data in our problem. We also propose and analyze different machine learning approaches to train prediction functions based on these features and conduct experiments on real crime data over multiple years. The experiments demonstrate that the popular time feature is more relevant than the historical information about the number of crimes around a POI, but both information is much less critical than the spatio-temporal information. This work is the first that studies the popular time feature extracted from POIs data and historical criminal information for predictive policing from the authors' knowledge. © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {Throughout the last decade, researchers have proposed different frameworks for studying cities and to guide practitioners in designing, implementing and evaluating smart city strategies. Some of these frameworks have emerged as more salient or relevant than others. This ongoing research paper seeks to understand if the dimensions, components, and elements proposed in the well-recognized framework called 'A comprehensive view of smart city components and elements' originally developed by Gil-Garcia, Pardo, and Nam [5], are present in the Brazilian context and if and how the framework might be revised to better understand the particularities of Brazilian cities. Through the use of a case study, it appears that the framework, in general terms and at the component level of the framework is useful as is, however, the results also indicate that there are some elements that could be reconsidered through elaborations and modifications to the current descriptions of some elements. Future research is needed with additional cities in the Brazilian context and beyond, but this first study seems to indicate the potential practical value of the preliminary elaborated framework. © 2020 ACM.},

The plan also states that to establish a basis for solutions in these domains, investments in the following strategic fronts are needed: human capital, innovation, technology, and regulation. We here summarize important scientific and technological advances in IoT, conducted by Brazilian institutions in the aforementioned strategic fronts: Code IoT education platform (human capital); Caninos Loucos SBC family and SwarmOS (technology); telecommunication regulation and the General Law for Personal Data Protection (LGPD) (regulation, security and privacy); and five applications (innovation) - Smart traffic lights, Smart surveillance, health monitoring of childhood cancer patients, Sleep apnea diagnosis, and Internet of Turtles.We also discuss regulatory aspects towards flexibilizing IoT services, and a recent law that protects the privacy of citizens in Brazil. These efforts clearly show a growing development of IoT in Brazil, particularly in areas that solve urgent problems, such as health and the environment. Additionally, the existence of a national IoT platform leverages the massive creation of high-impact applications in the near future. © 2020 River Publishers. All rights reserved.},

The time window considered was February 2016, 2017, and 2018. By means of information visualization techniques, we describe the location of accidents across São Paulo region and later associate important factors (such as climate and radar) to the occurrence of traffic jams. Subsequently, a spatial study is conducted to visualize the bus routes and observe possible transit bottlenecks. As result, we deploy a visualization tool named SmartViz Traffic to emphasize the importance of monitoring accidents, aiming prevention and road safety, as well to inform the traffic dynamic in São Paulo city. © 2020 IEEE.},

Over the years, the growth of data sources from distinct online social networks has enabled new perspectives to applications that provide mechanisms to aid in comprehension of how people displaces between different regions within a city. To support enterprises and governments better understand and compare distinct regions of a city, this work proposes a web application called PlaceProfile to perform visual profiling of city areas based on iconographic visualization and to label areas based on clustering algorithms. The visualization results are overlayered on Google Maps to enrich the map layout and aid analyst in understanding region profiling at a glance. Besides, PlaceProfile coordinates a radar chart with areas selected by the user to enable detailed inspection of the frequency of categories of points of interest (POIs). This linked views approach also supports clustering algorithms’ explainability by providing inspections of the attributes used to compute similarities. We employed the proposed approach in a case study in the São Paulo city, Brazil. Copyright © 2021 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda. All rights reserved.},

According to the Corruption Perceptions Index 2017, for 180 countries/territories studied, most of them are making little or no progress in ending corruption in the public sector. The public money laundered affects direct investments in infrastructure to improve the city’s performance. The corruption encourages directly the illicit activities formation and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimates that hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue from illicit activities are handled globally every year and was identified in the context of National Risk Assessments as part of the major risks that could affect countries in development. These practices have generated negative effects in society and the cities are the context in which all these issues occur. Then, this paper has aimed to conduct a qualitative reflection of how smart cities, which represent efficiency and effectiveness places, can contribute through your intelligent environment to mitigate the corruption process and illicit market operations. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {In day-to-day life, all could witness the odor of scattered garbage and unkempt garbage bins because there is no proper time interval schedules and routines, which results in garbage overflow. It also creates hygienic problems, land pollution, and landscape unpleasantness. This scenario demands a system that observes the garbage bin status and provides evidence to the authorities administrating the collection intervals for emptying the bins. The so-called Digital Garbage Bin Monitoring System (DGBMS) is a smart garbage management system relying on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology that can solve this problem. This system monitors the garbage excess and the moisture in the garbage bin. In this project, a sensor network detects the garbage level and the garbage moisture in the dustbin via an Infrared (IR) sensor and then sends evidence to the decision-making party through an IP address. The UNO ARDUINO board interfaces the sensors with the IP address and handles the actuators. An RFID channel constantly monitors the necessary garbage information regarding the different locations of the wastebaskets. Developing countries, especially the rural areas, are severely concerned with these issues that can cause severe health problems among the population. Implementing this solution could contribute to addressing many health-related issues in these countries. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The main objective of this work is to group data from official sources to evaluate these social aspects. This type of study has the characteristic, in addition to being a data collector, of providing a conjuncture reference for future works. Issues that present as critical factors in the Brazilian context were selected and presented with relevance within the international indicator frameworks. Data and indicators available in national and municipal databases are used to highlight quantitative results. Finally, a discussion is held to synthesize the social landscape of the evaluation and provoking a reflection on the distance between the concept of smart cities and the social problems experienced in Brazil, mainly regarding social inequality.  © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Current approaches to smart cities have focused on implementing technologies to harvest and analyse data through sensors and artificial intelligence to improve urban performance from the top-down. However, cities are complex systems of interconnected layers that change at different speeds. More persistent layers, like networks and occupation, must have smartness embedded in them through smarter design processes. In recent years, there has been an increase in digital tools for urban design, applying computational design methods and data analytics strategies, enabling collaborative and evidence-based approaches that support sustainable urban design. A critical evaluation of their potential to inform design is necessary to aid practitioners to choose and adopt these novel strategies and tools in practice.

	abstract = {NUMA systems have become commonly used in HPC. However, to fully take advantage of these systems, the right thread-To-core allocation and page placement are essential. On top of that, considering that many parallel applications have limited scalability, applying thread throttling (i.e., artificially reducing the number of active threads) most of times will further improve energy and/or performance. Because it involves many variables, most of the previous research has not considered applying the aforementioned approaches altogether. Therefore, not using a smart method to converge to a satisfactory solution precludes an efficient design space exploration, not unlocking NUMA systems' full potential. Considering that, we propose a new methodology, which involves evaluating the number of threads, thread-To-core allocation, and page placement independently (i.e., we apply a local search to each one). By evaluating and using the right sequence of local searches, we significantly reduce the design space exploration and still maintain the quality of results (w.r.t to an exhaustive global search), making it applicable to real-world scenarios. Our experiments using several parallel applications running on two different NUMA systems show that our methodology speeds up the search by to 9 \times, on average, reducing the search space in at least 70% and up to 86%, while finding optimal or near-optimal solutions. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Machine Learning techniques have been employed in virtually all domains in the past few years. New applications demand the ability to cope with dynamic environments like data streams with transient behavior. Such environments present new requirements like incrementally process incoming data instances in a single pass, under both memory and time constraints. Furthermore, prediction models often need to adapt to concept drifts observed in non-stationary data streams. Ensemble learning comprises a class of stream mining algorithms that achieved remarkable prediction performance in this scenario. Implemented as a set of (several) individual component classifiers whose predictions are combined to predict new incoming instances, ensembles are naturally amendable for task parallelism. Despite its relevance, an efficient implementation of ensemble algorithms is still challenging. For example, dynamic data structures used to model non-stationary data behavior and detect concept drifts cause inefficient memory usage patterns and poor cache memory performance in multi-core environments. In this paper, we propose a minibatching strategy which can significantly reduce cache misses and improve the performance of several ensemble algorithms for stream mining in multi-core environments. We assess our strategy on four different state-of-Art ensemble algorithms applying four widely used machine learning benchmark datasets with varied characteristics. Results from two different hardware show speedups of up to 5X on 8-core processors with ensembles of 100 and 150 learners. The benefits come at the cost of changes in predictive performances. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Sensors are being extensively deployed and are expected to expand at significant rates in the coming years. They typically generate a large volume of data on the internet of things (IoT) application areas like smart cities, intelligent traffic systems, smart grid, and e-health. Cloud, edge and fog computing are potential and competitive strategies for collecting, processing, and distributing IoT data. However, cloud, edge, and fog-based solutions need to tackle the distribution of a high volume of IoT data efficiently through constrained and limited resource network infrastructures. This paper addresses the issue of conveying a massive volume of IoT data through a network with limited communications resources (bandwidth) using a cognitive communications resource allocation based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) with SARSA algorithm. The proposed network infrastructure (PSIoTRL) uses a Publish/Subscribe architecture to access massive and highly distributed IoT data. It is demonstrated that the PSIoTRL bandwidth allocation for buffer flushing based on SARSA enhances the IoT aggregator buffer occupation and network link utilization. The PSIoTRL dynamically adapts the IoT aggregator traffic flushing according to the Pub/Sub topic’s priority and network constraint requirements. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {In the Internet of Things (IoT), extending the average battery duration of devices is of paramount importance, since it promotes uptime without intervention in the environment, which can be undesirable or costly. In the IoT, the system’s functionalities are distributed among devices that (i) collect, (ii) transmit and (iii) apply algorithms to process and analyze data. A widely adopted technique for increasing the lifetime of an IoT system is using data fusion on the devices that process and analyze data. There are already several works proposing data fusion algorithms for the context of wireless sensor networks and IoT. However, most of them consider that application requirements (such as the data sampling rate and the data range of the events of interest) are previously known, and the solutions are tailored for a single target application. In the context of a smart city, we envision that the IoT will provide a sensing and communication infrastructure to be shared by multiple applications, that will make use of this infrastructure in an opportunistic and dynamic way, with no previous knowledge about its requirements. In this work, we present Heracles, a new data fusion algorithm tailored to meet the demands of the IoT for smart cities. Heracles considers the context of the application, adapting to the features of the dataset to perform the data analysis. Heracles aims at minimizing data transmission to save energy while generating value-added information, which will serve as input for decision-making processes. Results of the performed evaluation show that Heracles is feasible, enhances the performance of decision methods and extends the system lifetime. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Smart cities are those that use science, engineering, artificial intelligence, digital knowledge, and other technologies to progress the well-being of residents, boost economic development, and at the same time, promote and favor sustainability, as also to improve infrastructure, optimize urban mobility, and engender solutions sustainable, to generate efficiency in urban operations, this is, improving the population’s quality of life. Smart cities are automated and more sustainable cities, considering that technology is fundamental, but it is only a means to resolve a set of urban issues and attain purpose and goals that are increasingly essentials for large urban centers. This is achieved through the employment of advanced ICT (Information and Communications Technology) to stimulate sustainable development, and improvement in the quality of life, in which everything becomes connected. Through this, for example, it is possible to count on the fastest free public WiFi, i.e., high-speed internet for all residents and visitors and the interconnected functioning of traffic, lighting, public transport systems, among others. There are also discussions on reducing public spending and transparency in the relationship between government and citizens. It is evident, especially in large cities, that something must be done to increase the quality of life, public services, and sustainability. In addition to urban planning, it is necessary to invest in technological solutions that can be accepted and used by the residents of each smart city. Therefore, this chapter aims to provide a scientific major contribution related to the current overview of Smart City, approaching its essential concepts and fundamentals, with a concise bibliographic background, addressing its evolution and relationship with other technologies, as also categorizing and synthesizing the potential of technology. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Considering the COVID-19 pandemic scenario, the importance of monitoring and controlling pollution emissions becomes more relevant and fundamental for combating the disease. Seeking to contribute with technological tools, this work presents a proposal for a system based on IoT using low sensors to monitor the most novice pollutants to health, according to the recommendations of the World Health Organization. The proposal presents the development in the hardware layer of a device able to measure the concentrations of the following pollutants: Particulate Material (PM2.5 and PM10), Ozone, Carbon Monoxide, Nitrogen Dioxide and Ammonia by means of three sensors, respectively, PMSA003, MICS-6814 and MQ-131. The device is be equipped with the ESP-WROOM-32 microcontroller that has a Wi-Fi and Bluetooth wireless interface that will allow data to be sent to a server in the cloud. It is important to note that what differentiates from the proposal from others is the implementation of periodic notifications and the sending of alerts for cases in which a given pollutant has reached the maximum acceptable concentration.  © 2020 IEEE.},

This justifies the undergone research aiming at increasing their performance under certain conditions. Taking the example of the single-phase PLLs, researchers have worked out ways to cope with the characteristic doubly-frequency oscillation, which can undermine the performance of the frequency and phase tracking and compromise the extraction of the fundamental component from the input signal. In this sense, the present article aims at analysing a single-phase PLL circuit providing a methodology to adjust the control gains and minimise low-frequency oscillation. As for the analysed PLL, simulations in the time domain were carried out for modified versions of the well-known E-PLL, SOGI-PLL, and APF-PLL, all of them comprising notch filters and to cope with the doubly-frequency oscillation. © 2021, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

	abstract = {The fifth generation (5G) of mobile networks has started its operation in some countries and is aimed at meeting demands beyond the current system capabilities such as the huge amount of connected devices from IoT applications (e.g., smart cities), explosive growth of high-speed mobile data traffic (e.g., ultrahigh definition video streaming), and ultrareliable and low latency communication (e.g., autonomous vehicle). To attend to these needs, the electromagnetic spectrum must be made available, but the static spectrum allocation policy has caused a spectrum shortage and impaired the employment/expansion of the wireless systems. To overcome this issue, the dynamic spectrum access (DSA) has been promoted in 5G/6G networks, which is enabled by the cognitive radio (CR) technology. Although diverse mechanisms have been developed to tackle the challenges that emerge in different CR layers/functionalities, a standardized testing methodology and system for CR is still immature. Existing standards or methodologies and systems for CR only focus on the definition of network technologies (e.g., IEEE 802.22 and IEEE 802.11af), performance evaluation of CR algorithms/mechanisms, or definition of the device cognition level via performance results or psychometric approaches, not covering systems/methodologies to verify if the device meets the CR capabilities and regulatory policies, neglecting the conformance testing. In this respect, this paper proposes a flexible methodology and system for CR conformance testing under two perspectives, functionalities and limits. We instantiate it by using the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) software-defined radio platform and present a proof-of-concept with a conformance metric. The results show the feasibility of our proposal. © 2021 Francisco S. S. Silva et al.},

The large-scale use of microservices and their increasing adoption in the industry in recent years has motivated researches on the most diverse aspects related to microservice-based development. However, as it is a relatively new topic, there is still no consolidated body of knowledge in the area. Objective. The present work intends to investigate the current state of research on microservices based on the formulation of six research questions covering fundamental aspects, such as: main interest topics and adopted standards, techniques and tools have been used and application areas. Method. From four digital libraries, 22 secondary studies were selected as a data source, which were analyzed and synthesized in the present study following the proposed research protocol. Results. Among the main topics of interest addressed, we highlight researches related to the applicability of microservice architecture, both by industry and academia. Results indicated that standards focus on challenges related to communication have been the most commonly considered by researchers of the area. Finally, the predominance in the use of the Docker container and the presence of DevOps practices in the automation of operations are noteworthy. Conclusions. The present mapping study points to some directions of research based on the identified gaps, such as modeling and testing of microservice applications, and addressing security aspects. Another promising point to be explored involves the combined use of microservice architecture with other related concepts such as IoT, smart cities, FOG computing and reactive systems, in order to reinforce the use of microservices, as well as creating new solutions and challenges to be researched. © 2020 ACM.},

Usually, IoT devices communicate via machine-to-machine protocols such as Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Due to the heterogeneous structure in IoT and the absence of security by design methodologies, security mechanisms in environments with MQTT traffic are needed, and they can be deployed as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). This paper proposes a Deep Learning (DL) based Network IDS trained using a public dataset containing MQTT attacks. We assess the proposal using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and weighted average. When evaluating the performance of our DL-based Network IDS, it obtained, in average, 97.09% of accuracy and an F1-score equal to 98.33% in the detection of MQTT attacks. Another important contribution of our work is the sharing of the experiments on GitHub, which guarantees the reproducibility of the research.  © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This last decade, the amount of data exchanged on the Internet increased by over a staggering factor of 100, and is expected to exceed well over the 500 exabytes by 2020. This phenomenon is mainly due to the evolution of high-speed broadband Internet and, more specifically, the popularization and wide spread use of smartphones and associated accessible data plans. Although 4G with its long-term evolution (LTE) technology is seen as a mature technology, there is continual improvement to its radio technology and architecture such as in the scope of the LTE Advanced standard, a major enhancement of LTE. However, for the long run, the next generation of telecommunication (5G) is considered and is gaining considerable momentum from both industry and researchers. In addition, with the deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) applications, smart cities, vehicular networks, e-health systems, and Industry 4.0, a new plethora of 5G services has emerged with very diverging and technologically challenging design requirements. These include high mobile data volume per area, high number of devices connected per area, high data rates, longer battery life for low-power devices, and reduced end-to-end latency. Several technologies are being developed to meet these new requirements, and each of these technologies brings its own design issues and challenges. In this context, deep learning models could be seen as one of the main tools that can be used to process monitoring data and automate decisions. As these models are able to extract relevant features from raw data (images, texts, and other types of unstructured data), the integration between 5G and DL looks promising and one that requires exploring. As main contribution, this paper presents a systematic review about how DL is being applied to solve some 5G issues. Differently from the current literature, we examine data from the last decade and the works that address diverse 5G specific problems, such as physical medium state estimation, network traffic prediction, user device location prediction, self network management, among others. We also discuss the main research challenges when using deep learning models in 5G scenarios and identify several issues that deserve further consideration. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The industrial sector is reinventing itself to find improved production processes. Industry 4.0 brings opportunities for growth productivity with the IIoT. There is a range of IIoT-related technologies to manage vast volumes of data that should be stored and processed for the decision-making process. Cloud computing is a reliable option for remote storage and data processing. However, in situations where the requirement is response time, intermittent connectivity, and low latency, edge computing processing is a more suitable option. Any device with computational resources can implement an edge computing capability with functions like gateway and data aggregator capabilities. These devices need to be classified to avoid an uncontrolled proliferation of appliances in the enterprise’s environment, which easily create cybersecurity vulnerabilities and transform device management into chaos. This study proposes a taxonomy for edge computing and defines industrial application guidelines as a strategy to facilitate their sustainable implementation. © 2021, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

To date, more than half of world’s population live in urban areas and, by 2050, one estimates that almost 70% of them will live in cities. Thus, in order to avoid a total collapse, cities’ urban planning must be rethought urgently by means of new planning and management models largely supported by robust digital technologies, innovations and a sustainable agenda. In this scenario, the concept of smart city emerges yet without a formal consensus. Smart city definitions have been derived from interdisciplinary concepts applied to cities most of them based on the management and heavy use of information and communication technology in cities. Thus, to allow a better comprehension of what is understood by smart city mainly under the perspective of emerging markets, this work seeks to identify what is the social representation of smart city amongst Brazilian citizens, comparing same to the extant literature on smart city definition. © 2021, IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

	abstract = {Large cities seek to incorporate intelligent systems into their infrastructure, industrial, educational, and social activities to improve the quality of service provided to citizens and make all processes more efficient. To this end, these cities use technologies that involve the areas of the Internet of Things, Big Data, and Governance to make decisions by governments and authorities. In the field of Urban Computing, it is possible to use open data in the GTFS format to solve the problems of the urban transport system using complex network metrics that make it possible to model complex interactions between objects in high dimensionality. Stops and routes are modeled as a graph, characterized by complex network metrics. According to the literature, if there is an interruption of the urban transport system, we make an evaluation of the degree of vulnerability of the system in the search for solutions. The main goal of this paper is to propose an approach to analyze the vulnerability of the urban transport system using complex network metrics along with GTFS data in scenarios targeted failures. As a contribution, the proposed approach uses the concept of skewness in the methodology established in the literature. The skewness enables a better understanding and differential the failure conditions from the evaluation of the vulnerability the urban transport system, through a quantitative indication of which local metrics most influence the decay of network metrics. The analysis of the results obtained in the proposed approach serves as a subsidy for studies in the search for solutions to the problems of the urban transport system, providing a tool to the set of technological options for the planning of urban transport systems of smart cities available to governments and authorities. The proposed approach can be applied in different cities, regardless of their size and location, as long as you have access to open geographic data in the GTFS format.  © 2020 IEEE.},

A systematic literature review was conducted and merged with the existing e-government literature on critical success factors for adopting IT in the public sector. Identifying the government characteristics of smart governance sheds light on key organizational attributes that can pave the way for the transition from government to smart urban governance. The qualitative analysis of 96 articles on the governance of smart cities identified three main characteristics. The first is local government governance, related to the nature of the relationship among individuals, interest groups, institutions, and government. The second is government assets, which we believe are useful for providing support to smart urban governance in the form of funding, technology, and human capital. The third includes local government management, involving elements of strategy and the positioning of local public administration. Compared to literature in e-government, the governmental characteristics are quite similar, however, the focus of e-government is to transform the organization internally, while in smart urban governance literature, the focus is to transform both internally and externally. Future research should focus on understanding how governments could develop organizational capabilities to achieve internal and external transformation. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic imposes a whole new way for cities to deal with crises. More than ever, in order to protect the citizens, cities need to rely on data to address such a public health emergency. In this sense, the Urban Control and Command Centers (CCCs) are an important governance organism to help the monitoring and the management of the complex dynamic of contemporary cities. These centralized and integrated management structures in the form of a governmental agency can aid the decision makers into a more coordinated, systemic, strategic, and data-driven intervention. In Rio de Janeiro's case, the city Urban CCC-called Rio de Janeiro Operations Center (COR in the Portuguese abbreviation)-is mostly designed to monitor the daily routine of the different systems and infrastructures that compose the city's dynamic, to plan and integrate operations for big events like Rio 2016 Olympic Games and to manage emergency situations. With the monitoring center, Rio is able to identify abnormalities and make sure that any interference in the city can be resolved in a timely manner, in order to ensure that the city comes back to normal in the face of a disruption and runs as smoothly as possible. Regarding the context of the pandemic of the COVID-19, Urban CCCs can also be an important tool to manage health emergencies. In this paper, the case of the COR is presented, showing how this Brazilian city is using its Urban CCC to monitor and assist the authorities with real time data intelligence to respond to this unprecedented emergency.  © 2020 IEEE.},

It aims to find out what alternatives have been proposed to guide IoT application developers in the implementation of security measures through all development phases. In this literature review, we identified 21 security frameworks, and we analyzed them from IoT application domains addressed and IoT elements protected. We find four application domains: generic, smart cities, smart car/VANET, and smart infrastructures. Concerning elements protected, we analyzed the frameworks through protected application resources and we also consider security properties in this paper. Our two principal findings are: (i) Even though there are a wide variety of security frameworks, we did not find a proposal that addresses all the layers of an IoT application (device, network, service and application) and all development phases (analysis, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance), (ii) Addressing security from the design phase allows IoT developers to have a broader perspective of the system, avoiding massive changes to be made in later stages, saving costs and time. This gap and concerns enable various research on security by design and secure development to be carried out, and proposed frameworks to address the identified problems. © 2021 J.

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly present in our daily activities, connecting the most varied types of physical devices present around us to the internet. IoT is the basis for smart cities, e-health, precision agriculture, among others. With this growth, the number of cyber-attacks against these types of devices and services has also increased. Each type of attack has its specific characteristics that allow its identification and prevention through machine learning techniques. However, classic machine learning techniques may have their performance compromised due to the non-stationary characteristics of these environments, together with the search for different types of vulnerabilities by attackers, attacks can suffer different types of mutations, in addition to the great possibility of new types of attacks arising over time. In this article, we propose an algorithm called Fuzzy Intrusion Detection System for IoT Networks (FROST) to identify cyber-attacks on IoT networks. FROST uses the concepts of fuzzy set theory to make the learning task more flexible, seeking to improve the performance in the classification of inaccurate data. In addition, FROST has a mechanism for identifying new types of intrusion online, during the classification of new instances. To evaluate our approach, we used the UNSW-NB15 data set and compared our method with another approach, very consolidated in the literature, which performs the same type of task. The results showed that FROST has a good performance in the classification of different types of attacks and that the fuzzy technique used helped to reduce errors and identify anomalies.  © 2020 IEEE.},

Despite the positive results on accidents and traffic jams indicators, a major part of society did not approve the new policy, and two years later, the speed limits returned to the previous values. This example shows the importance of the population’s participation in the creation of urban policies. Conclusively, we discuss the impact of communication for success in public policy planning and its implementation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Therefore, focusing on the convergence of the concepts of smart tourism destinations and smart cities, a qualitative research was conducted based on semi-structured interviews and content analysis. According to the theoretical-conceptual perspective and the opinion of the experts, Lisbon is recognized as a very attractive and competitive tourist destination but is still in the process of establishing itself as a smart destination. Considering the factors that constitute smart cities and smart tourist destinations, the results show that Lisbon stands out especially in relation to culture and creativity, innovation, information and communication technologies, sustainability, and governance. Although the city of Lisbon has a consolidated strategic plan for tourism and a strong public-private relationship, to become a smart tourism destination, it is essential that there is greater investment in technological infrastructure, greater involvement of citizens in the process of tourism governance and better information management as a strategic tool for tourism. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Recommender systems are an alternative to automatically integrate the data generated in such environments with predictive models and recommend actions content or services. The data produced by smart devices are accurate and reliable for predictive and decision-making contexts. This study main purpose is to assist patients and doctors in the early detection of disease or prediction of postoperative worsening through constant monitoring. To achieve this objective this study proposes an architecture for recommender systems applied to healthcare which can prioritize emergency cases. The architecture brings an ensemble approach for prediction which adopts multiple Machine Learning algorithms. The methodology used to carry out the study followed three steps. First a systematic literature mapping second the construction and development of the architecture and third the evaluation through two case studies. The results demonstrated the feasibility of the proposal. The predictions are promising and adherent to the application context for accurate datasets with a low amount of noises or missing values.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Currently, Internet applications running on mobile devices generate a massive amount of data that can be transmitted to a Cloud for processing. However, one fundamental limitation of a Cloud is the connectivity with end devices. Fog computing overcomes this limitation and supports the requirements of time-sensitive applications by distributing computation, communication, and storage services along the Cloud to Things (C2T) continuum, empowering potential new applications, such as smart cities, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR). However, the adoption of Fog-based computational resources and their integration with the Cloud introduces new challenges in resource management, which requires the implementation of new strategies to guarantee compliance with the quality of service (QoS) requirements of applications. In this context, one major question is how to map the QoS requirements of applications on Fog and Cloud resources. One possible approach is to discriminate the applications arriving at the Fog into Classes of Service (CoS). This paper thus introduces a set of CoS for Fog applications which includes, the QoS requirements that best characterize these Fog applications. Moreover, this paper proposes the implementation of a typical machine learning classification methodology to discriminate Fog computing applications as a function of their QoS requirements. Furthermore, the application of this methodology is illustrated in the assessment of classifiers in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness to noise. The adoption of a methodology for machine learning-based classification constitutes a first step towards the definition of QoS provisioning mechanisms in Fog computing. Moreover, classifying Fog computing applications can facilitate the decision-making process for Fog scheduler. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

At the same time, the popularization of sensing devices has enabled the acquisition of a vast amount of vehicular mobility data (mobility traces). In this sense, a recent trend is to use mobility traces to extract hidden knowledge and apply it to improve solutions for vehicular networks. In this article, we present and discuss a workflow, through a short survey, related to the process of generating mobility traces, preprocessing these datasets, and obtaining knowledge to create intelligent vehicular networks. We describe the main types of mobility data highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. We classify the primary methods for obtaining knowledge from mobility data. Also, we exemplify how these mobility traces and methods can be applied to vehicular networks by reviewing recent contributions. Furthermore, we illustrate through a case study how to obtain knowledge from a specific type of mobility trace. Finally, we point out new research directions that involve mobility traces and intelligent vehicular networks. © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

The publish-subscribe paradigm is a suitable approach to connect users and service providers. For many private and public services, including transport and emergency services, only some subscribers should receive event notifications. This paper proposes and investigates the performance of a new ENS framework which allows the sending of events to a subset of subscribers with the best conditions to handle it. The event model implemented by the ENS framework is derived from the publish-subscribe approach. It allows the best subscribers to receive the event based on a specific fitness function. An application of the ENS to the transport service is presented. The results show that when the best subscribers are chosen according to a specific desired metric, the travel time can be reduced or the best drivers can be selected. Therefore, this strategy can improve passengers' experience and optimize service performance. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Automated license plate recognition (ALPR) technology is a powerful technology enabling more efficient and effective law enforcement, security, payment collection, and research. A common license plate standard was adopted by the member states of the Mercosur trading bloc (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) and consequently requires an upgrade to the ALPR software used by law enforcement and industry. Due to the scarcity of real license plate images, training state-of-the-art supervised detectors is unfeasible unless data augmentation techniques and synthetic training data are used. This paper presents an accurate and efficient automated Mercosur license plate detector using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained exclusively with synthetic imagery. In order to obtain the synthetic training data, Mercosur license plates were faithfully reproduced. Digital image processing techniques were employed to reduce the domain gap and a CNN with basic image manipulation was used to embed the artificial licensed plates in to realistic contexts. The trained model was then validated on real images captured from a parking lot and a publicly available traffic monitoring video stream. The results of experiments suggest detection accuracy of about 95% and an average running time of 40 milliseconds. © 2019 IEEE.},

The treated results of several measurements of EV charging characteristics provided the basis to estimate the increase in electricity demand. Deterministic and stochastic analyzes considering the influence of the distance previously traveled by the vehicle and the moment of its connection to the network were compared, allowed to obtain the diversity factor. This study shows the influence of the connection moment to recharge EVs in predicting the capacity of transformers as well as the need for their stochastic treatment. Therefore, the results recommended implementing communication systems to offer attractive tariffs aiming at shifting the recharging of EVs to daily times of lower demand.  © 2020 IEEE.},

In this context, this article presents the collaborative model for detection and alert of potholes (CoMDAP), which provides a distributed framework that automatically collects, analyses and shares pothole and traffic data among users and drivers without any human interaction. Our differential idea consists of using particular hardware in the vehicles to automatically detect the potholes in the roads with better accuracy. The evaluation methodology first considers a prototype executed in simulated (a toy and in-home lanes) and real (a car in a particular road) scenarios in order to observe the accuracy of detecting the potholes. Furthermore, we implement an Android application that notifies the drivers as they approach a pothole. The results were encouraging, highlighting the benefits of using CoMDAP as a counterpart to enable smart cities. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

Due to CAPEX/OPEX problems, a small cell deployment is not an economic strategy in scenarios of intense data traffic, so the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to improve network coverage and performance becomes feasible. In order to improve the Quality of Service of the network, a computational system was proposed to perform decision making that receives as input network information such as network throughput, packet loss rate, and delay, and returns the network quality for a specific type of network application. The system as a whole verifies the necessity or not of using UAVs to improve the quality of the network and the coverage of the area of highest demand. If UAVs are required, they are shifted to these areas. Otherwise, the UAVs remain in the base station. Through the proposed method there were significant improvements in the Quality of Service (QoS) of the network, allowing a reduction in packet loss ratio and delay, and an increase in the network throughput rate. © 2019 IEEE.},

IoV forms a solid backbone for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), which paves the way for technologies that better explain about traffic efficiency and their management applications. IoV architecture is seen as a big player in different areas such as the automobile industry, research organizations, smart cities and intelligent transportation for various commercial and scientific applications. However, as VANET is vulnerable to various types of security attacks, the IoV structure should ensure security and efficient performance for vehicular communications. To address these issues, in this article, an authentication-based protocol (A-MAC) for smart vehicular communication is proposed along with a novel framework towards an IoV architecture model. The scheme requires hash operations and uses cryptographic concepts to transfer messages between vehicles to maintain the required security. Performance evaluation helps analyzing its strength in withstanding various types of security attacks. Simulation results demonstrate that A-MAC outshines other protocols in terms of communication cost, execution time, storage cost, and overhead. © 2020 by the authors.},

Most of the time the citizens are not provided information about the buses in real-time (location, route, etc). This paper address this lack of information on public bus services and presents ShareBus, an information system to improve urban mobility. The system architecture and its main functionalities are described. A preliminary implementation of the system is also presented which is evaluated through real tests.

	abstract = {Software vendors are currently concerned to the development of software-intensive Information Systems (IS) that interoperate among themselves using web and/or mobile platforms. This phenomenon has risen the concept of System-of-Information Systems (SoIS), which is a set of interoperable and independent IS that exchange data and combine synergistic services to achieve broader business goals. Since new types of sociotechnical relations can be established to increase gains and productivity in this context, considering technical, business and social dimensions, Software Ecosystems (SECO) emerge as a theoretical lens to study SoIS. We claim that the software ecosystem perspective can foster the comprehension about SoIS by exploring the existing relations among constituent ISs within a SoIS as well as the nature of such relations. The main contribution of this work is to offer a conceptual model to support SoIS analysis under a SECO perspective, rising the idea of EcoSoIS. Coding analysis was applied to extract the main concepts of SoIS and SECO from experts and to link these concepts to compose the conceptual model. Smart city was used as an example to illustrate how the model could be instantiated. Once the model enables a conformant representation of the smart city SoIS under a SECO lens, we believe that the model can be used for other SoIS. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Wireless visual sensor networks are commonly employed on several applications contexts such as smart cities, intelligent transportation systems and industrial management, aiming at the use of visual data from cameras to provide enhanced information and to expand the networks utilities. In these scenarios, some applications may require high-definition images when performing more specialized tasks, for example in face and text recognition, adding an important monitoring requirement when using camera-based sensors. In fact, it is important to ensure that the network is able to gather visual data with the associated required quality to each task, and such perceived quality may be processed as a function of the Field of View (FoV) of the visual sensors. In order to address this issue, new quality metrics are proposed for wireless visual sensor networks that are deployed to perform area coverage, exploiting for that different perceptions of the FoV. Those metrics are proposed along with redeployment optimization methods for visual sensor nodes aiming at the improvement of the perceived monitoring quality, which are based on greedy and evolutionary-based approaches. The proposed metrics and algorithms are expected to be more realistic than previous solutions, allowing flexible processing of variables as cameras' positions, orientations and viewing angles, providing then high flexibility on the definition of parameters and significantly contributing to the development of sensor networks based on visual sensors. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As we all know that the technology is projected to be next to humans very soon because of its holistic growth. Now-a-days, we see a lot of applications that are making our lives comfortable such as smart cars, smart homes, smart traffic management, smart offices, smart medical consultation, smart cities, etc. All such facilities are in the reach of a common man because of the advancement in Information and Communications Technology (ICT). Because of this advancement, new computing and communication environment such as Internet of Things (IoT) came into picture. Lot of research work is in progress in IoT domain which helps for the overall development of the society and makes the lives easy and comfortable. But in the resource constrained environment of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and IoT, it is almost inconceivable to establish a fully secure system. As we are moving forward very fast, technology is becoming more and more vulnerable to the security threats. In future, the number of Internet connected people will be less than the smart objects so we need to prepare a robust system for keeping the above mentioned environments safe and standardized it for the smooth conduction of communication among IoT objects. In this survey paper, we provide the details of threat model applicable for the security of WSN and IoT based communications. We also discuss the security requirements and various attacks possible in WSN and IoT based communication environments. The emerging projects of WSNs integrated to IoT are also briefed. We then provide the details of different architectures of WSN and IoT based communication environments. Next, we discuss the current issues and challenges related to WSN and IoT. We also provide a critical literature survey of recent intrusion detection protocols for IoT and WSN environments along with their comparative analysis. A taxonomy of security and privacy-preservation protocols in WSN and IoT is also highlighted. Finally, we discuss some research challenges which need to be addressed in the coming future. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With populations in cities increasing in a very accelerated pace, the problem of collecting and handling the waste produced becomes a major concern to governmental authorities. Indeed, the amount of garbage they create is increasing even faster than their populations, worsening the problem and turning garbage collection into a very challenging task. In this paper, we see garbage collection through the spectacles of the emerging concept of smart cities, accounting for new performance measures defined on the grounds of sustainability, energy efficiency, optimum resource allocation, and low carbon emission and footprint. We thus devise a smart garbage collection management system, coined SmartGC, whose architecture is detailed and explained. Abstracting out garbage collection from a smart mobility perspective, the underlying methodology supporting the proposed architecture relies on the concept of artificial transportation systems. For the sake of demonstration we have implemented a routing strategy to generate improved itineraries accounting for the content of garbage containers, which are continuously monitored through IoT-based smart meters. Also, we discuss on how the architecture is instantiated and integrated into the smart city agenda of Natal, a medium-size capital in Northeastern Brazil.

This increase is mainly due to the emergence of new technologies such as Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT). Some of the biggest challenges in applying these systems, relate to the processing, visualization, and analysis of the generated data, since most systems tend to work connected, thus generating a large mass of data that deviates from the standard of previously used systems. For data visualization, one of the main devices used is the reduction of dimensionality, in an attempt to bring data from one dimension N to two or three dimensions and thus be noticeable to human eyes. There are several algorithms used for dimensionality reduction, the linear ones that as the name implies, solve linearly separable problems and so these are very limited and the nonlinear ones, that solve more complex problems, but usually have an excessive runtime, making them or often inappropriate to apply. This article presents the parallel implementation of the nonlinear dimension reduction algorithm t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), showing better results than its conventional version in terms of runtime, thus showing that parallelism can make the problem of dimensionality reduction treatable, bringing greater scalability and delivering results within an acceptable time frame. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {There will be a profound impact from 5G to develop smart cities. Questions such as 'How telecommunication operators will efficiently provide network infrastructure', 'When and where the quality of service parameters are degraded or below expected' are to be considered. In this context, the use of base stations carried by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) acting as flying cells to compensate areas where telecommunications systems are challenged by abnormal conditions during their operation has attracted attention. In this paper, we propose an intelligent solution based on a novel multilayered cellular automata for positioning flying cells and improvement of network capacity in context heavy traffic situations as congested cars in avenues in some hours of the day, crowded events, disaster or hot spot traffic. In our distributed approach, all UAV base stations operate in parallel. The self-organisation arises from an emergent pattern based on applying simple rules in a defined neighbourhood. The proposed scheme considers both backhaul and radio access network constraints, and user requirements in terms of downlink throughput. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs favourably compared with other schemes in terms of all metrics considered. Therefore, we provide a solution for rapid and efficient positioning of multiple UAV base stations to respond in real time to urgent network changes. © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) have a strategic goal to achieve service delivery in roads and smart cities, considering the integration and communication between vehicles, sensors and fixed road-side components (routers, gateways and services). VANETs have singular characteristics such as fast mobile nodes, self-organization, distributed network and frequently changing topology. Despite the recent evolution of VANETs, security, data integrity and users privacy information are major concerns, since attacks prevention is still open issue. One of the most dangerous attacks in VANETs is the Sybil, which forges false identities in the network to disrupt compromise the communication between the network nodes. Sybil attacks affect the service delivery related to road safety, traffic congestion, multimedia entertainment and others. Thus, VANETs claim for security mechanism to prevent Sybil attacks. Within this context, this paper proposes a mechanism, called SyDVELM, to detect Sybil attacks in VANETs based on artificial intelligence techniques. The SyDVELM mechanism uses Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) with occasional features of vehicular nodes, minimizing the identification time, maximizing the detection accuracy and improving the scalability. The results suggest that the suitability of SyDVELM mechanism to mitigate Sybil attacks and to maintain the service delivery in VANETs. © 2020 IEEE.},

Smart cities, smart agriculture, and e-health systems are examples of IoT applications that can exploit the opportunities generated by these technologies. However, due to the scale and complexity of the IoT and the heterogeneity of the devices and service level expectations, resource management is not a trivial task. While facilitating storage and processing at the end device (the edge), at the intermediary layer (the fog), or centrally (the cloud), new points of failure are introduced at and between each layer. In some use cases, such as e-health, device availability also has high criticality. Any downtime impacting one or more components in the architecture can result in adverse effects and/or additional logistical effort and cost.

Stream machine learning is an approach where data becomes available sequentially, called data stream, which adapts the prediction model with fixed window-sized data stream. The objective of this work is to analyze the effectiveness of buildings energy consumption using stream learning. To achieve this goal, MOA11Massive Online Analysis tool was used to evaluate the performance of the selected stream learning algorithms on an an open database. Batch algorithms were also used as testbed, to analyze the performance of stream algorithms related to them. Our work shows that stream learning can show good results in this scenario. © 2020 IEEE.},

Still, in most current IoT systems, actuation control is hard-wired and device-specific, making it impossible to deal with a dynamic and variable set of smart (and mobile) devices that have also intermittent wireless connectivity with the Internet. These are typical problems of Internet of Mobile Things (IoMT) settings, where smart objects (e.g., medical equipment, robots, UAVs, and vehicles) are not stationary.

The literature present applications and analysis of cities dynamics, citizens mobility, and others. In this work, we propose a ranking method to detect different functional regions through virtual sensors using location-based categorical data of multiple sources. Also, we computed a diversity index according to the categories contained in regions of a study area. As a result, we found patterns associated with the characteristics of these regions, that influenced the inferring of functional regions by the ranking method in temporal analyzes. We evaluated our method using real-world datasets from Foursquare (200,339 check-ins) and NYPD Motor Vehicle Collision (209,908 occurrences) in New York City in 2017. The aim was to evaluate the outcomes of the proposed method concerning different types of categorical data. Also, we presented a case study considering the integration of these data. The generated results can be used in applications related to urban planning and can benefit citizens, entrepreneurs, and the government. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Building Information modeling (BIM) can be used in a variety of ways to support real estate management. BIM models are the product of a comprehensive digital design process, serving as the basis for representing and storing a large amount of data and information about a real estate investment project, which can be new construction, renovation, expansion, acquisition or even the renting of a building. These digital building models are, therefore, excellent sources of information for performing analysis and simulations, such as the one proposed in this article. Recently, technical standards have been created in Brazil to guide Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) representatives, as well as public officials, regarding the use of BIM in new projects. An information portal on the Brazilian dissemination strategy for BIM has been created, as well as a national BIM library, which contains digital components uploaded by qualified suppliers and vendors, available for entrepreneurs to download and use in their projects. The analysis proposed here uses an automatic evaluation of real estate projects, represented as BIM models. These models are verified in relation to the Brazilian regulatory framework on BIM. This process aims to conduct a compliance assessment of digital building models based on the appropriate use of BIM components in accordance with the construction information classification system prescribed by the Brazilian technical standards. An evolutionary prototype was then implemented as an extension application to run within a BIM platform. This application is designed to perform a rule checking process. Rules are defined from Brazilian BIM regulations, and their compliance is are verified from information retrieved from BIM models, which range from generic components to families of objects supplied by the manufacturers themselves, including the stages of execution of the work. Thus, the various levels of detail of the information obtained from the assessment of BIM models are very useful for real estate management, and from them it is also possible to generate some indicators to be used, for example, in the context of smart buildings and smart cities.

	abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is evolving to multi-application scenarios in smart cities, which demand specific traffic patterns and requirements. Multi-applications share resources from a single multi-hop wireless networks, where smart devices collaborate to send collected data over a Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL) emerged as a routing protocol to be used in IoT scenarios where the devices have limited resources. Instances are RPL mechanisms that play a key role in order to support the IoT scenarios with multiple applications, but it is not standardized yet. Although there are related works proposing multiple instances in RPL on the same IoT network, those works still have limitations to support multiple applications. For instance, there is a lack of flexibility and dynamism in management of multiple instances and service differentiation for applications. In this context, the goal of this work is to develop a solution called DYNAmic multiple RPL instanceS for multiple ioT applicatIons (DYNASTI), which provides more dynamism and flexibility by managing multiple instances of RPL. As a result of this, the traffic performance of multiple applications is enhanced through the routing, taking into consideration the distinct requirements of the applications. In addition, DYNASTI enables the support of sporadic applications as well as the coexistence between regular and sporadic applications. DYNASTI achieved results that demonstrate a significant improvement in reducing the number of control messages, which resulted in increased packet received, decreased end-to-end delay, reduced energy consumption, and an improvement in service differentiation to multiple applications. © 2020 by the authors.},

To obtain knowledge for determining suitable routing paths as users go about their daily routine, nodes maintain history of every encounter and exchange the information through summary vectors. Due to large node populations, the size of summary vectors makes it challenging to implement real-world city-scale applications with the technology. In this paper, we take the technology a step towards real-world implementation by proposing a set of adaptive and privacy-preserving mechanisms that can be incorporated into existing encounter-based routing protocols to reduce summary vector sizes without compromising delivery guarantees. We validate our proposals with real-world human movement traces and simulation experiments. In terms of network performance, our proposals reduce the average summary vector size by 75% to achieve up to 21% less energy consumption with about 28% improvement in throughput. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.},

However, this trend inevitably leaves a massive amount of information and infrastructure connected to the public Internet, which exposes the data to many security threats and challenges. In this paper, we discuss the need for fine-grained user access control for IoT smart devices. The inherently distributed nature of IoT environment necessitates the support of multi-authority attribute-based encryption (ABE) for the implementation of fine-grained access control. Therefore, we present a secure fine-grained user access control scheme for data usage in the IoT environment. The proposed scheme is a three-factor user access control scheme, which supports multi-authority ABE and it is highly scalable as both the ABE key size stored in the user's smart card and ciphertext size needed for authentication request are constant with respect to the number of attributes. Through the formal and informal security analysis, we show that the proposed scheme is secure and robust against several potential attacks required in an IoT environment. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs at par or better than existing schemes while providing greater functionality features. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The need and importance of Smart Spaces have been potentially realized by the researchers due to its applicability in the current lifestyle. Opportunistic network, a successor of mobile ad hoc networks and a budding technology of network, is a best-suited technology for implementing Smart Spaces due to its wide range of applications in real-life scenarios ranging from building smart cities to interplanetary communication. There are numerous routing protocols which are available in opportunistic network, each having their pros and cons; however, no research till the time of listing has been done which can quantitatively demonstrate the maximum performance of these protocols and standardize the comparison of opportunistic routing protocols which has been a major cause of ambiguous performance evaluation studies. The work here presents a categorical view of the opportunistic routing protocol family and thereby compares and contrasts the various simulators suited for their simulation. Thereafter, the most popular protocols (selecting at least one protocol from each category) are compared based on node density on as many as 8 standard performance metrics using ONE simulator to observe their scalability, realism, and comparability. The work concludes by presenting the merits and demerits of each of the protocols discussed as well as specifying the best routing protocol among all the available protocols for Smart Spaces with maximum output. It is believed that the results achieved by the implemented methodology will help future researchers to choose appropriate routing protocol to delve into their research under different scenarios. © 2020 Puneet Garg et al.},

	abstract = {Global industry is undergoing major transformations with the genesis of a new paradigm known as the Internet of Things (IoT) with its underlying technologies. Many company leaders are investing more effort and money in transforming their services to capitalize on the benefits provided by the IoT. Thereby, the decision makers in public waste management do not want to be outdone, and it is challenging to provide an efficient and real-time waste management system. This paper proposes a solution (hardware, software, and communications) that aims to optimize waste management and include a citizen in the process. The system follows an IoT-based approach where the discarded waste from the smart bin is continuously monitored by sensors that inform the filling level of each compartment, in real-time. These data are stored and processed in an IoT middleware providing information for collection with optimized routes and generating important statistical data for monitoring the waste collection accurately in terms of resource management and the provided services for the community. Citizens can easily access information about the public waste bins through the Web or a mobile application. The creation of the real prototype of the smart container, the development of the waste management application and a real-scale experiment use case for evaluation, demonstration, and validation show that the proposed system can efficiently change the way people deal with their garbage and optimize economic and material resources. © 2020 by the authors.

Understanding, design, and operation of such a system should be supported by a comprehensive ontology. The paper gives a short introduction to the structure of ontologies as consisting of a schema-level ontology - an elaborated entity-relationship model - and many entity-value-level ontologies - for each entity type a list or taxonomy of entity values or a specification how entity values should be formatted (such as the XML format for date and time). The paper outlines a process of developing a comprehensive ontology by collecting and integrating specifications from many sources and illustrates this process by building a very preliminary taxonomy of (smart) ecosystem functions from seven sources. Making ecosystems smart can improve the quality of life and contribute to more sustainable communities. All rights reserved.

	abstract = {Inefficient parking solutions in metropolitan areas contribute to the creation of traffic jams that lead to stress for the drivers and contribute toward greenhouse emissions. Since parking issues affect most of the citizens, it is hard to imagine future smart cities with efficient parking solutions. With the introduction of the Internet of things (IoT), objects are able to connect to the Internet and may collect data in real time. The potential of these data is enormous and may allow cities to move from estimates to concrete data, which enable precise predictive models to be created and improves urban area planning and scaling. For this reason, parking solutions would benefit from the introduction of the IoT concept of connecting everything. The paper overviews the most common parking solutions, analyzing their pros and cons. Then, it introduces an IoT-oriented smart parking system that can be deployed indoor and/or outdoor. With the proposed solution, drivers can remotely monitor the vacancy status of parking spots in real time through a mobile app (or even Web). Furthermore, the solution acts as a repeater, extending the wireless signal to parking slots that are distant from the primary access point. This solution is evaluated, demonstrated, and validated through a prototype, and it is ready for use. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.},

However, besides from research in environmental criminology, few studies are known in urban computing evaluating the effect of street network features on crime occurrences for predictive and pattern recognition models. In this work, we analyze several street network features—from the perspectives of graph theory—and evaluate their impact on predictive policing models. Our results—based on years of historical crime incidents from San Francisco—suggest that although some street network features are spatially autocorrelated, others have a high mutual dependency to certain sort of crime occurrences. We then leverage selected street networks features in our exemplary use-case scenario for Crime Hotspot Detection, discussing the relationship between street network design and criminal activity. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

A critical assessment of the respected criteria for sustainable urban and rural areas is presented in order to further clarify its boundaries with other related topics, as well as providing a clear benchmark for future studies. After screening the search results between 1900 and 2018 on the Web of Science database, 7397 publications explicitly related to sustainable urban and rural areas were extracted and analyzed by the CiteSpace software via the relevant bibliometric indicators. The results of this study shed light on the trends and patterns, consisting of kernel research areas, countries, journals, institutions, and how these entities have been concatenated, inside the bibliographic records around sustainable urban and rural areas.

	abstract = {Innovative, low-cost, environmentally friendly and renewable resource-based solutions are emerging to meet growing global energy demand. Hydroelectric technology is quite old and mature. Despite its importance, it is associated with large plants, with environmental impact. On contrary, small-scale systems, called pico-hydro systems (up to 5 kW) are not yet explored. Anyway, the exploration of pico-hydro systems has been increasing consistently, from the first off-grid applications in remote places to distributed generation, with the injection of the generated energy in the main grid or microgrids. Very recently, there have been advances in grid connection of these small-scale systems, using off-the-shelf components. Indeed, pico-hydro systems can be connected to the grid using off-the-shelf components, namely photovoltaic inverters. Thus, grid-connected pico-hydro systems have gained an enormous potential in distributed production. However, in situations of over-power, or whenever the generator is under no load, there is a need for effective over-voltage protection, unlike photovoltaic systems. The goal of this paper is to propose an over-voltage protection circuit, designed to ensure the integration of low-power pico-hydro systems connected to the grid using conventional photovoltaic microinverters. Extensive tests were performed on an experimental platform using three microinverters easily found on the market and a low power generator (300 W) developed for small wind turbines. The experimental results, demonstrated the performance of the proposed over-voltage protection circuit in four different situations, presented in this work, thus avoiding irreversible damages of generators and microinverters, in the context of the above described grid connection approach. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

Floods can negatively affect the structure and operations of a railway network, causing travel delays, train service cancellations, and major fines for the railway. The objective of this article is to conduct a bibliographic review of what is available in publications on natural disasters, particularly landslides and floods, big data techniques, and railroads, at international and national levels. A bibliometric analysis was carried out according to the “PRISMA Flow Diagram” guidelines. The analysis in this study was conducted through searches of the following reference databases: Scopus, Web of Science, Scielo, and Google Scholar. After the keyword search was completed, the absence of available data and references relating to Brazil was verified. This justified the development of this and other related papers, and the efforts necessary to turn these data into useful information for the managers of cities and environmental institutions. The aim of this study is to fill the gap in the research, focusing on Brazil, related to big data, smart cities, and natural disasters (particularly, landslides and floods), and to propose other papers that can be developed in this subject area. © 2020 by the authors.

The capacity to provide more detailed consumption information and more accurate consumer feedback is an essential step towards energy sustainability. On the end-user side, a system that supports the measurement of several points of consumption and provides visual information can help consumers reduce energy waste. On the other side, electric utilities can use a real-time measurement system to infer the energy consumption behavior, to find metering inconsistencies, to optimize the system, or to maintain the reliability of the supply system based on data information. This work presents a demand-side management Framework for smart cities which aims to provide integration between consumers and energy distribution utilities. This Framework can help the electricity demand control, presenting real-time consumption data and presenting relevant data on their consumption points to consumers.

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted much attention from the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) community in recent years. One of the main reasons for this is the availability of techniques provided by this paradigm, such as environmental monitoring employing user data and everyday objects. The facilities provided by the IoT infrastructure allow the development of a wide range of new business models and applications (e.g., smart homes, smart cities, or e-health). However, there are still concerns over the security measures which need to be addressed to ensure a suitable deployment. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are among the most severe virtual threats at present and occur prominently in this scenario, which can be mainly owed to their ease of execution. In light of this, several research studies have been conducted to find new strategies as well as improve existing techniques and solutions. The use of emerging technologies such as those based on the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm has proved to be a promising alternative as a means of mitigating DDoS attacks. However, the high granularity that characterizes the IoT scenarios and the wide range of techniques explored during the DDoS attacks make the task of finding and implementing new solutions quite challenging. This problem is exacerbated by the lack of benchmarks that can assist developers when designing new solutions for mitigating DDoS attacks for increasingly complex IoT scenarios. To fill this knowledge gap, in this study we carry out an in-depth investigation of the state-of-the-art and create a taxonomy that describes and characterizes existing solutions and highlights their main limitations. Our taxonomy provides a comprehensive view of the reasons for the deployment of the solutions, and the scenario in which they operate. The results of this study demonstrate the main benefits and drawbacks of each solution set when applied to specific scenarios by examining current trends and future perspectives, for example, the adoption of emerging technologies based on Cloud and Edge (or Fog) Computing. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {Large cities are increasingly investing in efficient mobility and sustainable transportation as an alternative to expensive and pollutant traditional vehicles. In parallel, people are also seeking cleaner and healthier options for short and last-mile distances. In order to cope with this trend, which has boosted the adoption of bikes in urban areas, a major concern of the governments has been to build bike paths and tracks that allow cyclists to move safely and through shorter distances. However, such initiatives may result in bicycles infrastructure built alongside traditional vehicular roads or on inadequate regions. Therefore, there should be a flexible way to assess the quality of bike paths and tracks, combining variables that indicate adverse conditions for the health and safety of cyclists, such as statistical risk of accidents, air and noise pollution, excessive sunlight exposure, dangerous UV radiation, among others. This article then proposes a new comprehensive quality metric that combines sensed environmental data and historical reported incidents related to bike paths and tracks, which may be employed for traditional physical signaling or to support computer-assisted solutions for cycling monitoring and alerting. Such new metric exploits fuzzy logic to model a group of variables to ultimately provide a unified safety and health quality level, referred as BikeWay. Doing so, we expect to allow dynamic and historical perceptions of how healthy and safe the bike paths and tracks are for cyclists in modern cities. © 2013 IEEE.},

The heterogeneity of domains, systems, data, and relationships among them requires defining a data model able to express information in a flexible, extensible way while promoting interoperability between systems and applications. Furthermore, smart city systems can benefit from georeferenced information to allow for more effective actions over the real-world urban space. Aiming at tackling challenges related to data heterogeneity while considering georeferenced information, this work introduces LGeoSIM, a semantic-based information model for smart cities as means of fostering interoperability and powerful automated reasoning upon unambiguous information. LGeoSIM relies on the recent NGSI-LD Specification, thereby encompassing the principles of Linked Data to allow semantically defining information through ontologies and their interconnection.

Saliency detection is a fundamental step in surveillance data analysis for providing help to the subsequent tasks, but unsuitable to IoT applications owing to the neglect of image similarity and difference from diverse IoT devices. To solve this problem, we enable the co-saliency detection in IoT, which detects the common and salient foreground regions in the group surveillance images. The main contributions include: 1) enable a multistage context perception scheme to efficiently extract the contextual information corresponding to different-size receptive fields in the single image; 2) construct a two-path information propagation to extract the interimage similarity and difference from the high-level image feature representations of the group images; and 3) propose the stage-wise refinement to allocate the label information to different parts of the network for helping the network to learn the enriched semantically common knowledge. The extensive experiments performed on three public data sets can demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its superiority to four state-of-the-art co-saliency detection methods. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The trend of an ever-increasing number of geographically distributed sensors producing data for a plethora of applications, from environmental monitoring to smart cities and autonomous driving, is shifting the computing paradigm from cloud to fog. The increase in the volume of produced data makes the processing and the aggregation of information at a single remote data center unfeasible or too expensive, while latency-critical applications cannot cope with the high network delays of a remote data center. Fog computing is a preferred solution as latency-sensitive tasks can be moved closer to the sensors. Furthermore, the same fog nodes can perform data aggregation and filtering to reduce the volume of data that is forwarded to the cloud data centers, reducing the risk of network overload. In this paper, we focus on the problem of designing a fog infrastructure considering both the location of how many fog nodes are required, which nodes should be considered (from a list of potential candidates), and how to allocate data flows from sensors to fog nodes and from there to cloud data centers. To this aim, we propose and evaluate a formal model based on a multi-objective optimization problem. We thoroughly test our proposal for a wide range of parameters and exploiting a reference scenario setup taken from a realistic smart city application. We compare the performance of our proposal with other approaches to the problem available in literature, taking into account two objective functions. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model is viable for the design of fog infrastructure and can outperform the alternative models, with results that in several cases are close to an ideal solution. © Copyright 2020 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

	abstract = {Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) in sustainable smart cities are taking advantage of moving vehicle nodes for data communication. VANETs support many applications related to safety, infotainment, and accident detection. The routing protocols are using for data communication in the presence of high mobility nodes and dynamic topologies. Due to high mobility and unpredictable topologies, the data communication becomes unreliable which causes data loss, delay, and link disconnections among vehicle nodes. To address these routing limitations, various types of routing protocols have developed. In all existing routing protocols types, geographic routing protocols are one of the efficient types due to its low overhead processes. Geographical routing protocols are able to handle vehicular environment constraints. However, with many advantages, geographic routing protocols are not considering many constraints of the vehicular environment. Geographical routing protocols should have well-defined routing metrics to deal with high mobility and other data loss and link disconnection issues. This research designs a Beaconless Traffic-Aware Geographical Routing Protocol (BTA-GRP) by considering traffic density, distance and direction for next forwarder node and route selection. The protocol is feasible for urban dense and sparse traffic conditions and addresses delay, disconnection and packet dropping issues. The proposed protocol has simulated with state of the art routing protocols. The simulation results indicated that the proposed protocol has higher performance in VANETs. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.. All rights reserved.},

Nonetheless, the existing platforms do not offer high-level interfaces to provide developers with proper tools that could reduce the complexity of developing applications, neither an interface to organize data visualization to end-users. Aiming at tackling such limitations, this work presents Web-based dashboards to support development and data visualization in smart city applications: the former is tailored to application developers, whereas the latter is suited to visualize data. This paper presents the use of these dashboards in association with a platform that integrates heterogeneous urban data with geographical information while supporting the development of smart city applications on top of this data. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.},

In these cities, IoT devices generate spatial data constantly. Thus, data get increasingly voluminous very fast. In this paper, we investigate the challenge of managing these data through the use of a spatial data warehouse and spatial on-line analytical processing designed over a parallel and distributed processing framework extended with a spatial analytics system. We propose a novel architecture aimed to assist a smart city manager in decision-making, which integrates a cloud layer where these technologies are located with a fog computing layer for extracting, transforming and loading. Furthermore, we introduce a set of guidelines to aid smart cities managers to implement the proposed architecture.

Exposing devices in IoT should impact these persons activities. Then, we present the Resource Management Architecture, where several IoT Objects endowed with sensors and actuators can be added to environments that are represented virtually in the architecture. The IoT Objects become available to be consumed by users through the use of applications. The architecture is composed of three layers: one representing devices, the cloud solution, and applications, and how they interact with each other.

	abstract = {A Smart City can be defined as a high-tech city with several public and private services capable to strategically solve (or mitigate) problems normally generated by rapid urbanization. Different models of indicators have been developed to follow cities’ evolution to become a Smart City. An example of such model is the standard 37120 from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that proposes a set of dimensions and indicators (e.g. Transportation, Recreation, Solid Waste) for services and quality of life for sustainable cities and communities. It has been common to find official social network profiles of organizations and governmental entities related to the services they provide or are responsible for (water, waste, transportation, cultural events, etc.) and that are used by citizens as a gateway to directly interact and communicate their complains and problems about those services. The present paper proposes to apply machine learning algorithms over the urban data generated by social networks in order to create classifiers to automatically categorize citizens messages according to the different cities services dimensions. For that, two distinct text datasets in Portuguese were collected from two social networks: Twitter (1,950 tweets) and Colab.re (65,066 posts). The texts were mapped according to the different ISO 37120 categories, preprocessed and mined through the use of 8 algorithms implemented in Scikit-Learn. Initial results pointed out the feasibility of the proposal with models achieving average F1-measures around 55% for F1-macro and 78% for F1-micro when using Linear Vector Classification, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Complement Naive Bayes. However, as the datasets were highly unbalanced, the performances of the models vary significantly for each ISO category, with the best results occurring for Wastewater, Water & Sanitation, Energy and Transportation. The classifiers generated here can be integrated on a number of different city services and systems such as: governmental support decision systems, customer complain systems, communities dashboards, police offices, transportation's companies, cultural producers, environmental agencies, and recyclers’ companies. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

Today, an increasing number of vehicles may send data to the Internet, helping car manufacturer to implement the Industry 4.0 paradigm. The collected data during the lifetime of the vehicles can be used to improve both product and production facilities. Moreover, the availability of additional data coming from onboard sensors could be used to obtain information about the environment surrounding the vehicle. The Smart City scenario includes an extraordinary number of new sensors (in urban area) and vehicles can be thought as additional mobile sensors. This paper describes the prototype of a Vehicle-to-Cloud interface with OBD-II (On Board Diagnostic) communication, 3G/4G connectivity, and LoRaWAN [used as backup channel]. LoRaWAN infrastructures are largely diffused in Smart Cities and they can provide a suitable alternative to cover some areas when 3G/4G fails. Last, considering the Smart City scenarios, this paper discusses the application constrains and design directions to achieve a correct integration between LoRaWAN infrastructure and the Internet of Intelligent Vehicles. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Edge computing (EC) is a promising technology capable of bridging the gap between Cloud computing services and the demands of emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Most EC-based solutions, from wearable devices to smart cities architectures, benefit from Machine Learning (ML) methods to perform various tasks, such as classification. In these cases, ML solutions need to deal efficiently with a huge amount of data, while balancing predictive performance, memory and time costs, and energy consumption. The fact that these data usually come in the form of a continuous and evolving data stream makes the scenario even more challenging. Many algorithms have been proposed to cope with data stream classification, e.g., Very Fast Decision Tree (VFDT) and Strict VFDT (SVFDT). Recently, Online Local Boosting (OLBoost) has also been introduced to improve predictive performance without modifying the underlying structure of the decision tree produced by these algorithms. In this work, we compared the four-way relationship among time efficiency, energy consumption, predictive performance, and memory costs, tuning the hyperparameters of VFDT and the two versions of SVFDT with and without OLBoost. Experiments over 6 benchmark datasets using an EC device revealed that VFDT and SVFDT-I were the most energy-friendly algorithms, with SVFDT-I also significantly reducing memory consumption. OLBoost, as expected, improved the predictive performance, but caused a deterioration in memory and energy consumption. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The development of more efficient communication technologies and the affordability of powerful hardware platforms have brought the smart cities prospects to a more realistic setting. Actually, this promising scenario has fostered the development of different monitoring and control applications aimed at improving the quality of life in modern urban areas, often implemented through sensors and actuators networks. Nevertheless, multiple concurrent sensing applications may have different levels of criticality according to the impact of the performed tasks for the protection of people's integrity and thus they should be treated in different ways. This article then proposes a prioritization approach to guide the development of sensors-based applications in smart city scenarios, which will be differentiated based on their monitoring objectives, some contextual prioritization parameters and the detection of critical events. This approach will also define security mechanisms to ensure that all sensor nodes will follow the defined prioritization policies for the considered smart cities. Besides simulation results, the proposed definitions and mechanisms were completely implemented for additional validation, resulting in a set of codes to facilitate the construction of practical sensor applications based on the proposed approach. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The role of transport in sustainable development was first recognized at the 1992 United Nations (UN) Earth Summit and reinforced in its outcome document—Agenda 21. It is also part of objective 11 of UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The improvements in the traditional methods of transportation lag behind the necessities. This paper shows that Magnetic Levitation (MagLev) can fulfill the demand and fits with smart grid concepts. Moreover, the levitation method based on the diamagnetic property of high-temperature superconductors in the proximity of rare-earth permanent magnets presents advantages in comparison with other levitation methods. This technological solution was tested with the operation of a real scale prototype inside the campus of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), operating since 2014. The paper presents a historical and technological overview of the steps necessary to turn this prototype into a commercial product. The development is framed within NASA’s Technological Readiness Levels (TRL). A new transportation paradigm is on the verge of becoming a reality. © 2020 by the authors.

As a result of the increase in population in large cities and the number of vehicles, the consequences of accidents and congestion can be even more significant, considering the impacts on the economy, environment and people's quality of life. Therefore, aiming to minimize these impacts, we present ALIVE, a distributed and Vanet-based solution that reduces congestion caused by different sources and, especially, from accident sources, contributing to efficient urban mobility in smart cities. The solution performs the detection of accidents and the dissemination of warning messages in multiple hops. Besides, the system can share the road traffic information with the nearby streets to improve traffic efficiency. We evaluated the proposed solution with PANDORA and NRR Traffic Management solutions. Simulation results indicate that the proposed solution reduces the average travel time, time lost, and the number of transmitted messages. © 2020 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Human concentration in urban environs is under intense investigation as city leaders and urban planners attempt to develop and deliver services to these people. Urban design to service the needs of large concentrations of people faces significant social, technical, environmental, and economic challenges. Urban design and city service delivery is being transformed by Digital Innovation (DI). At its core, DI is driven by the collection, analysis and dissemination of increasing complex data. The transformation of data into information that informs these city leaders and planners is fundamental to the design of any “Smart” City. In this paper we present a novel approach to identifying the DI transformation of Smart Cities. We build a functional indicator model grounded in socio-technical (Smart), socio-environmental (Sustainable), and socio-economic (Quality of Life) informed by sixteen specific Service Themes. We find that the framework offers cities an ability to quantify performance, target investments, and benchmark DI evolution to improve Smart, Sustainable, Quality of Life design for cities. This model extends the typical Smart City framework through the inclusion of the two other social transformation activities critical to meeting needs of the population. The resulting proposal contains indicators of smart city, sustainability and quality of life. © 2020 WMSCI 2020 - 24th World Multi-Conference on Systemics, Cybernetics and Informatics, Proceedings.

New transportation systems are being built in order to meet sustainability and efficiency criteria, as well as being adapted to the current possibilities. Moreover, citizens are becoming aware about the power and possibilities provided by the current generation of autonomous devices. In this sense, this paper presents and discusses state-of-the-art transportation technologies and systems, highlighting the advances that the concepts of Internet of Things and Value are providing. Decentralized technologies, such as blockchain, are been extensively investigated by the industry, however, its widespread adoption in cities is still desirable. Aligned with operations research opportunities, this paper identifies different points in which cities' services could move to. This also study comments about different combinatorial optimization problems that might be useful and important for an efficient evolution of our cities. By considering different perspectives, didactic examples are presented with a main focus on motivating decision makers to balance citizens, investors and industry goals and wishes. © 2020 by the authors.},

Considering the particularities of each, the approach embraces two concepts known as social machines and data artifacts. On the one hand, social machines act as wrappers over applications (e.g., social media) that allow citizens and things to have an active role in their cities by reporting events of common interest to the population, for example. On the other hand, data artifacts abstract citizens’ and things’ contributions in terms of who has done what, when, where, and why. For successful smart cities, the approach relies on the willingness and engagement of both citizens and things. Smart cities’ initiatives are embraced and not imposed. A case study along with a testbed that uses a real dataset about car-traffic accident in a state in Brazil demonstrate the technical doability and scalability of the approach. The evaluation consists of assessing the time to drill into the different generated data artifacts prior to generating useful details for decision makers. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.},

In this context, population growth in urban centers manifested challenges in the economic and cultural aspects of society. Issues such as mobility and sustainability come up. ICT plays an important role in this scenario, as it enables innovative services to citizens to improve their quality of life. Objective: To identify and analyze technological solutions (tools, services, applications or products) of urban public monitoring in order to characterize them, with respect to smart cities and ubiquitous devices, from the point of view of researchers and public agents in the field. context of theoretical and applied research in the literature. Method: A Systematic Literature Mapping (SLM) was performed to characterize the research in the area. Results: It was found that most studies treat as important and global trend urban public monitoring through ubiquitous devices in the context of smart cities. Conclusion: Urban public monitoring can be performed through appropriate ICT infrastructures, using devices such as sensors to capture and transmit data in real-time. This communication takes place without the use of wires and it is necessary to worry about the energy efficiency and accuracy of these ubiquitous devices.

	abstract = {Over the years, knowledge on how to engineer software-intensive system-of-systems (SoS) have been expanded and advanced. With the emergence of smart cities, which is a remarkable example of SoS, there is also an emerging need that almost any type of system should be prepared to join the smart city system and become a constituent of that SoS, even temporarily. However, several attempts to build a real SoS have stumbled on the limitations of single systems, also known as Constituent System (CS), to fully interoperate in the context of a SoS. The majority of the existing systems were not designed to be part of a SoS, interoperate in a instantaneous way, or maintain their operational independence despite their participation in one or more SoS. Based on this context, the main contribution of this paper is to exploit how to design a software architecture for systems that are intended to become part of a SoS in the future. We conducted a software architecture design process to conceive a constituent architecture for Urban Mobility domain as CS. We evaluated the architecture by means of simulation. Preliminary results reveal that our proposal comply with the requirements raised during the architectural design process and can increase the possibility of a system to be a constituent of SoS. © 2020 IEEE.},

Recently, several smoke and fire detection methods are presented with reasonable accuracy and running time for normal IoT environment. However, these methods are unable to detect smoke in foggy IoT environment, which is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient system based on deep convolutional neural networks for early smoke detection in both normal and foggy IoT environments. Our method takes advantage of VGG-16 architecture, considering its sensible stability between the accuracy and time efficiency for smoke detection compared to the other computationally expensive networks, such as GoogleNet and AlexNet. Experiments performed on benchmark smoke detection datasets and their results in terms of accuracy, false alarms rate, and efficiency reveal the better performance of our technique compared to state-of-the-art and verifies its applicability in smart cities for early detection of smoke in normal and foggy IoT environments. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Spatial concentrations (or spatial clusters) of moving objects, such as vehicles and humans, is a mobility pattern that is relevant to many applications. Fast detection of this pattern and its evolution, e.g., if the cluster is shrinking or growing, is useful in numerous scenarios, such as detecting the formation of traffic jams or detecting a fast dispersion of people in a music concert. On-Line detection of this pattern is a challenging task because it requires algorithms that are capable of continuously and efficiently processing the high volume of position updates in a timely manner. Currently, the majority of approaches for spatial cluster detection operate in batch mode, where moving objects location updates are recorded during time periods of a certain length and then batch-processed by an external routine, thus delaying the result of the cluster detection until the end of the time period. Further, they extensively use spatial data structures and operators, which can be troublesome to maintain or parallelize in on-line scenarios. To address these issues, in this paper we propose DG2CEP, a parallel algorithm that combines the well-known density-based clustering algorithm DBSCAN with the data stream processing paradigm Complex Event Processing (CEP) to achieve continuous and timely detection of spatial clusters. Our experiments with real-world data streams indicate that DG2CEP is able to detect the formation and dispersion of clusters with small latency while having higher similarity to DBSCAN than batch-based approaches. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Theworld's population growth and climate changes increase the demand for high-qualitywater. This fact forces humankind to create new water management strategies. Smart cities have successfully applied the Internet of Things (IoT) technology inmany sectors. Moreover, Complex Event Processing (CEP) can analyze and process large data sets produced by IoT sensors in real-time. Traditional business processes are too rigid in expressing the dynamic behavior of water supply systems. Every execution pathmust be explicitly specified. On the other hand, declarative business processes allow execution paths that are not prohibited by the rules, providing more flexibility for water supply managers. This paper joins together IoT, CEP, and declarative processes to create a powerful, efficient, and flexible architecture (REFlexWater) to manage water supply systems. To the knowledge of the authors, REFlexWater is the first solution to combine these technologies in the context of water supply systems. The paper describes the REFlexWater architecture and demonstrates its application to a real water system from a Brazilian municipality. Results are promising, and the managers from the Brazilian water company are expanding the use of REFlexWater to other sectors of their water supply system. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm that aims at making people's life easier, e.g., through highly automated production processes in Smart Factories. In the IoT, heterogeneous interconnected devices communicate through standardized internet protocols to reach common goals. Well known applications of the IoT are Smart Homes, Smart Factories, or Smart Cities. However, setting up new IoT environments can be cumbersome, since this oftentimes requires many complex manual steps, such as setting up devices, configuring sensors, or writing scripts. The heterogeneity and high distribution in the IoT makes this task even more complex and time consuming. To ease the setup of IoT environments, we propose a new approach composed of (i) a toolbox with common building blocks of the IoT, and (ii) a business process based approach to orchestrate the setup of these building blocks. Through our approach, domain experts can select the building blocks they require for their IoT application and generate a step-by-step manual for their setup.

The blockchain authorizes all devices in the network to improve their credibility and authenticity. What's more, a blockchain-based data sharing framework that combines a PRE scheme is introduced for secure device-to-device communication in smart communities.

However, even though the index offers greater insight for city management, IQVU does not consider user perception in its measurement. Collaborative mapping initiatives and crowd mapping, are digital cartographic methods capable of collecting and transmitting information about urban behavior, using citizens itself as the observer and regulator of events. This paper aims to validate areas with the highest quality of urban life through the overlap of IQVU information and crowd mapping initiatives in Belo Horizonte.

	abstract = {In recent years, there has been an increase in demand for food of animal origin. The number of intensive production systems such as pig and poultry farming has been increasing more and more and exerting great impacts on the environment, due to a large amount of particulate material and gaseous pollutants that are generated within these facilities. Thus, low-cost devices emerge as a cheap alternative that provides farmers with information on indoor air quality in its facilities. However, it is important that these devices make precise and accurate measurements, providing reliable concentration readings. Therefore, the objective of this study is the construction and validation of a low-cost system capable of measuring, storing and sending, via the mobile network, the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, carbon dioxide, PM2.5, PM10, temperature, and relative humidity. Preliminary inter-comparison tests showed that the built system had a reliable behavior in relation to all variables, even though the CO2 sensor was the one with the highest determination coefficient. The built device is able to provide continuous monitoring of atmospheric pollutants concentrations, at low cost and with simple handling. © 2020, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

In an emergency situation, mobile units such as police cars, fire trucks, and ambulances should move to the emergency location, thus performing an adequate care. A key question for achieving high performance in the service is to define and apply criteria to select and activate mobile units for each emergency situation. This paper presents an event-based protocol with event filtering by subscriber’s fitness, named Event to Most Suitable Subscribers (EMSS), by which the most appropriate mobile units are activated. A publish-subscribe middleware that implements the EMSS protocol was also developed. An application of the middleware to the police and the firefighter services is presented. The results show that, in the case where the most suitable mobile units are chosen, the service response time can be reduced. Therefore, the emergencies are more quickly attended, what is crucial for saving lives. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Context: In contrast to traditional software systems that are mostly created from scratch, current software systems are engineered as a junction of systems already in operation. Examples can be found in domains, such as smart cities, crisis and emergency, IoT, big data, industry 4.0, and connected health systems. Most of them can be considered systems-of-systems (SoS), since they refer to alliances of operational and managerial independent software-intensive systems, which are sometimes distributed over different environments. Therefore, SoS software architectures must be dynamic, evolve over time, and support the execution of emergent behaviors to accomplish SoS missions. They must be also designed to enable the connection of heterogeneous systems, making possible their interoperation, communication, coordination, cooperation, and collaboration, most of the times, in a seamless way. Similar challenges have been addressed by using software mediators as architectural entities. However, the application of mediators in SoS has not been properly explored. Goal: This article introduces MediArch, a layered architecture that considers mediators as first-class software entities to be used in the construction of SoS architectures. Our objective is to present evidence about how MediArch’s can support the construction of SoS architectures. Methods: The following four steps were conducted to define MediArch: (1) identification of mediation requirements to allow SoS properties; (2) establishment and categorization of twelve types of mediators, for enabling capabilities of communication and control of constituent systems interactions and conversion of heterogeneous messages exchanged through a mediation infrastructure; (3) specification of duties, behaviors, assumptions, and guarantees of mediators; and (4) organization of MediArch in three layers, namely, the constituents & consumer systems layer; the communication, conversion, & coordination layer; and the control layer. This architecture was used as the backbone for the software architectures of two SoS in different domains, namely, flood monitoring system-of-systems (FMSoS), and health-care supportive home system-of-systems (HSH-SoS), for providing evidence on how MediArch supports the architecting process of SoS. Results: MediArch (1) supports the integration of independent constituent systems, (2) provides strategies to manage emergent behaviors, (3) defines different schemes of control authorities, (4) offers elements to support SoS evolution, and (5) promotes the resilience and adaptability of SoS architectures. Conclusions: Although MediArch contributes to the establishment of SoS architectures, some challenges related to performance, resource consumption, security, safety, and non-disruptive reconfigurations must still be overcome. © 2019, The Author(s).},

A consequence of the wide implementation of Internet of Things-based devices in smart city applications clearly reflects the mentioned dynamics by the huge amount of data to be handled. To extract useful information from such data, a clever approach to conduct data analysis is the interdisciplinary one, i.e., engineering and computer scientists as close partners of the problem domain experts. This paper addresses IoT data of a Public transportation System (PTS) aiming at contributing to the data analysis process for new insights about bus based PTS applications.

	abstract = {The software architecture community has played a crucial role in the development of mobile software. Many of the ideas used in the design of these systems came from traditional software architecture and those ideas have contributed to mobile computing becoming ubiquitous. Mobile applications in the context of smart cities are very challenging since they need to operate within the power, processor, and capacity limitations of mobile devices, the exacting demands of life critical smart city requirements, and the constantly changing and exposed environment which may not always be trusted. Since there are no widely accepted design models for this type of software, developers must resort to primitive design decisions to meet all the needs of these applications, which takes additional time and expertise. For this reason, this study aims to investigate the design process for mobile applications in the context of smart cities. In order to address the lack of verified information about designing mobile apps, we conducted a multi-case study with 9 applications from 4 different development groups to build a grounded theory. The applications were reverse engineered to expose the architecture of each application. Based on all the data, an initial grounded theory was constructed to explain how the selected design process produces an app with the desired characteristics. The resulting theory offers explanations for how software engineering teams design mobile apps for smart cities. This knowledge will serve as a basis to further understand the phenomena and advances towards more effective design and development process definitions. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Therefore, our proposal develops a simple gateway access node that virtualizes the domains to which the devices connect. A prototype for services of security and quality of service has been implemented and its evaluation shows that virtualization of the access node does not impact the performance of virtual network functions.

In such a complex environment, a one-size-fits-all approach does not adapt well to varying demands and may hinder the adoption of IoT Smart Applications. In this paper, we propose a 5-layer IoT Architecture and a 5-stage IoT Computing Continuum, as well as provide insights on the mapping of software components of the former into physical locations of the latter. Also, we conduct a performance analysis study with six configurations where components are deployed into different stages. Our results show that different deployment configurations of layered components into staged locations generate bottlenecks that affect system performance and scalability. Based on that, policies for static deployment and dynamic migration of layered components into staged locations can be identified. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Extracting knowledge from unstructured data silos, a legacy of old applications, is mandatory for improving the governance of today's cities and fostering the creation of smart cities. Texts in natural language often compose such data. Nevertheless, the inference of useful information from a linguistic-computational analysis of natural language data is an open challenge. In this paper, we propose a clustering method to analyze textual data employing the unsupervised machine learning algorithms k-means and hierarchical clustering. We assess different vector representation methods for text, similarity metrics, and the number of clusters that best matches the data. We evaluate the methods using a real database of a public record service of security occurrences. The results show that the k-means algorithm using Euclidean distance extracts non-trivial knowledge, reaching up to 93% accuracy in a set of test samples while identifying the 12 most prevalent occurrence patterns. © 2020 IEEE.},

This article presents a survey on the provisioning of ubiquitous intelligent services for vehicular users. It also identifies clusters of research interest on this subject. To this end, an evaluation of results from six scientific research databases supports these goals. This process initially identified 37 328 publications; after filtering and clustering, the scope of analysis became 39 articles. The main contributions points to (i) the existence of five active research clusters, as a result of the inclusion of a visual clustering step in the systematic mapping protocol; (ii) an indication of a string of studies starting in the late '90s from traffic issues, intelligent transport systems and profiling, to smart cities, the Internet of Things, big data, fog computing and internet of vehicles in recent years; and (iii) that the main challenges associated with the implementation of ubiquitous intelligent services for vehicular users are related to data security, infrastructure, connectivity and high mobility. © 2019 The Authors 2019.

	abstract = {Current infrastructures in modern cities are highly dependent on complex software-intensive systems, which are composed of many elements, including software, sensors, actuators, and processes. Citizens and managers are also important stakeholders in these systems, as they provide data, provide and retrieve information and also manage the many systems that control the city infrastructures’. UML has been often considered for designing these types of systems, mostly with focus only on designing the software elements of the system. However, these infrastructures systems are composed of many more elements than software, including processes, constraints, sensors, networks, laws and further documents. SysML is a UML profile that has gained attention in past years, as SysML also models systems elements that are not software. In this paper, the main idea is to describe a SysML profile for modeling smart cities applications, which is useful as it specifies common elements of a city as native elements of system design. The profile, named SmartCitySysML, extended from SysML Requirements, Sequence and Block Definition diagrams in order to model system and software elements for smart cities. Design of a road traffic control system regarding a group of intersections is used as a case study. As a result, SmartCitySysML facilitates the use of common elements in smart city infrastructures and provides a visual representation to assess quality of diagrams from a practical point of view. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Examples of smart city services are traffic efficiency, security, surveillance, localization, healthcare services, infrastructure support among others. Any of these services will be able to get information from their users and from the network through our model, once an important issue in smart city is the challenge to collect or deliver useful and processed data to stakeholders. In this proposal, the evaluation of the model was conducted through emulations on Mininet and POX controllers.

The advanced meter infrastructure (AMI) measures, collects and analyzes the distribution and consumption of utilities such as water, electricity, and gas, which are of vital importance for the implementation of smart cities. In this paper, we employ LoRa, which is a low power wide area network technology (LPWAN), for the communication of meter devices and network server, and we study the coexistence of two kinds of messages: regular and alarm events. Our focus is on the analysis of the alarm events, which can be characterized by emergency situations and require ultra-reliability. We investigated the feasibility of the alarms for a smart metering scenario through simulation campaigns and a mathematical model. By assigning a different spreading factor (SF) to the device depending on whether the event is regular or alarm, we assessed the system performance. We evaluate the availability, reliability, and quantity of alarms that satisfy the restricted requirements of alarms events and do not compromise the performance of regular events. The best performance for regular events at SF-7 was obtained when alarm events are allocated to SF-8, whereas the other combinations are affected for a stronger interference. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Natural resources management is essential, especially of water distribution within cities. In Brazil, water losses in distribution systems go up to around 38%. In the context of &#x201C;Smart Cities&#x201D;, technologies that use &#x201C;The Internet of Things&#x201D; can be applied to reduce such losses. The present article shows that leakages produce distinctive noise ranging from 100Â Hz to 1000Â Hz. Through digital signal processing techniques, such as the Discrete Fourier Transform and Goertzel Transform, the spectral signals are decomposed, revealing their components of frequency such as the intensity. An architecture that performs the communication between slave nodes through a TCP/IP network is then proposed. The slave nodes are responsible for data collection for leakage identification. The collected data is then sent to the data master where there is greater computing power. The data master will perform the processing according to the paradigm of edge computing, thus obtaining frequency responses and the identification of the leakage itself.

This is due to identified anomaly situations allow replanning traffic in large cities. However, this is a problem of difficult treatment, since it is difficult to label such data. This fact leads to some works in literature tackle the problem using unsupervised or semi-supervised learning algorithms. Techniques for labeling data allow using supervised learning. On the other hand, data streams raises questioning the performance of batch and stream learning algorithms. The purpose of this work is to present a process of anomaly detection in the execution time of vehicle traffic routes. Part of the proposed process was evaluated, using data collected in real scenarios. The results were promising for two of the evaluated routes. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

	abstract = {Sustainable smart cities use technology to improve the quality of life of their citizens and future generations. In this context, electronic waste disposal is still a challenge to be investigated, since electronic devices contain substances that may cause serious damage to the environment. Mobile and IoT technologies may contribute to the design of advanced solutions to this problem. However, it is still necessary to improve design methods so that they consider the citizens’ needs, and to integrate mobile technology with Internet of Things technology to promote the development of sustainable smart cities. In this paper, we propose the Participatory Hackathon Method for Sustainable Smart Cities. This method uses Personas and Design Thinking to structure activities during Hackathon sessions with experts and citizens. The Hackathon’s results are analyzed, and a final prototype is designed in a participatory way. We carried out a case study with students from technical level courses in Computing, Electronics, Logistics, and Work Safety, as well as developers, and citizens. The participants designed a prototype solution to collect electronic waste using smart recycling bins and mobile technology. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Electric mobility has the potential to catalyze the development of transport, contributing to mitigate climate change, and support incipient smart cities projects with an adequate electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) network. This study comes up with the mapping of well-suited locations for EVCS by using geographic information system (GIS) analysis in combination with knowledge from a survey conducted with local electric vehicle (EV) experts. The method was tested to meet the increasing demand for EVs in the municipality of Sao Paulo by 2025, assuming the need for around 3, 300 EVCS stations to support a penetration of 1 percent of EVs in urban private cars. EVCS is ideally situated in one third of the municipal districts of Sao Paulo, namely the Center, South Center, West and Southeast areas. Attributes such as unsafe non-urbanized areas and risk places subject to floods were highlighted as new findings to consider in Sao Paulo, with similar characteristics as others in Latin America areas, providing some insights about the challenges on the way to smart cities. © 2019 IEEE.},

An emerging solution to deal with this scenario is the convergence of information and communication technologies through the implementation of the concepts of smart cities and Internet of Things to provide solutions in diverse fields like infrastructure, transportation, and surveillance. Considering this challenging scenario, in this article a multilevel IoT-based smart cities infrastructure management architecture is proposed and the waste management problem is used as a case study to evaluate the performance of the proposed solution. Results proved the concept of the architecture, showing that it is able to manage up to 3902 garbage bins simultaneously. These bins are able to correctly separate organic and recyclable waste in both indoor and outdoor scenarios, presenting low response times, what leads to a good quality of experience to the users of the system. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

The processing and analysis of these data play a key role in the implementation of initiatives for smart cities. In order to process urban Big Data, it is essential to use high-performance tools to accelerate processing and provide quick answers. However, this use is not trivial because Big Data tools are not interoperable and require from their users knowledge of parallel and distributed computing and databases. In this work, we compare popular open-source Big Data processing frameworks and propose a software system to abstract and facilitate their use in smart city applications. The architecture of the system is composed by an interface to specify dataflow models as well as services to interpret these models and instantiate them in different Big Data tools.

The integration of generic services such as enhanced mobile broadband (eMBB), massive machine-type communications (mMTC), critical machine-type communication (cMTC), and ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) can improve the performance of 5G-based applications. This service heterogeneity can be achieved by network slicing for an optimized resource allocation and an emerging technology, Tactile Internet, to achieve low latency, high bandwidth, service availability, and end-to-end security. In this paper, we discuss the application-specific nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA)-based communication architecture for Tactile Internet which allows nonorthogonal resource sharing from a pool of eMBB, mMTC, cMTC, and URLLC devices to a shared base station. We summarize various variants of NOMA and their suitability for future low latency Tactile-Internet-based applications. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This study aimed to analyze the relationship between carsharing and urban mobility in the context of smart cities. These themes converge with the current trend of the city and the introduction of new technologies to make life easier for citizens. The smart cities offer strategic principles aligning to the three main dimensions integration of infrastructures and technology-mediated services, social learning for strengthening human infrastructure, and governance for institutional improvement and citizen engagement. A growing number of cities are implementing carsharing programs to increase this transportation model, and São Paulo (Brazil) is one of these cities around de world. That model provides the general public with affordable access to public car, and can promote the integration of public transport systems and carsharing programs to improve mobility, traffic and environment related problems. One of the key factors for the success of such programs is the location of car stations in relation to potential transport demand. This study proposes a GIS-based method to calculate the spatial distribution of the potential demand for trips, locate stations using location-allocation models, and determine the best location to settle car-sharing stations. The results obtained shows which are the best places for the implementation of carsharing and its possible partnerships with several types of commercial establishments in the city of São Paulo. © 2019 The Authors.

	abstract = {Contemporary systems are increasingly complex, with both large codebases and constantly changing environments which make them challenging to develop, deploy and manage. We consider two recent efforts to tackle this complexity: Microservices and emergent software. Microservices have gained recent popularity in industry, in which monoliths of software are broken down into compositions of single-objective, end-to-end services running on HTTP which can be scaled out on cloud hosting systems. From the research community, the emergent systems concept demonstrates promise in using real-time learning to autonomously compose and optimise software systems from small building blocks, rapidly finding the best behavioural composition to match the current deployment conditions. We argue that emergent software and microservice architectures have strong potential for synergy in complex systems, offering mutually compatible lessons in dealing with complexity via scale-out design and real-time client-tailored behaviour. We explore self-designing microservices, built with emergent software, to demonstrate the complementary boundaries of both concepts-and how future intersections may offer novel architectures that lie at a compelling point between human- A nd machine-designed systems. We present the conceptual synergy and demonstrate a specific microservice architecture for a smart city example where scoped microservices are continually self-composed according to the demands of the applications and operating environment. For the purpose of reproducibility of the study, we make available all the code used in the evaluation of the proposed approach. © 2018 ACM.},

The low cost, ease of installation and the capacity of fine-tuning the parameters make this network a suitable candidate for the deployment of smart cities. In northern Sweden, in the smart region of Skellefteå, we have deployed a LoRaWAN to enable IoT applications to assist the lives of citizens. As Skellefteå has a subarctic climate, we investigate how the extreme changes in the weather happening during a year affect a real LoRaWAN deployment in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) and the use of Spreading Factors (SFs) when Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) is enabled. Additionally, we evaluate two propagation models (Okumura-Hata and Irregular Terrain Model (ITM)) and verify if any of those models fit the measurements obtained from our real-life network. Our results regarding the weather impact show that cold weather improves the SNR while warm weather makes the sensors select lower SFs, to minimize the time-on-air. Regarding the tested propagation models, Okumura-Hata has the best fit to our data, while ITM tends to overestimate the RSSI values. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The choice of the best location for the installation of gateways, as well as a robust network server configuration, are key to the deployment of a LoRaWAN. In this paper, we present an evaluation of Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) values collected from the real-life LoRaWAN deployed in Skellefteå, Sweden, when compared with the values calculated by a Radio Frequency (RF) planning tool for the Irregular Terrain Model (ITM), Irregular Terrain with Obstructions Model (ITWOM) and Okumura-Hata propagation models. Five sensors are configured and deployed along a wooden bridge, with different Spreading Factors (SFs), such as SF 7, 10 and 12. Our results show that the RSSI values calculated using the RF planning tool for ITWOM are closest to the values obtained from the real-life LoRaWAN. Moreover, we also show evidence that the choice of a propagation model in an RF planning tool has to be made with care, mainly due to the terrain conditions of the area where the network and the sensors are deployed. © 2019 IEEE.},

We examine the potential of the joint design of CRAHNs and ICN, and thoroughly review fundamental aspects and challenges of CR and ICN for smart cities. Subsequently, we qualitatively study the capability of information-centric cognitive radio-based networking for improving network connectivity, content search and distribution, reliability and confined delay in smart city safety and infotainment-based applications.

The term is used to denote the connectivity between electronic devices that allows the collect and sharing of data through the Internet. IoT technologies can be applied to automate and minimize problems related to urbanization in Smart City scenarios. In this context, MQTT brokers (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) are used to enable communication between IoT devices. Brokers are responsible for enabling connection and sending of messages between devices. The current literature presents a wide variety of brokers and to choose the suitable solution for the project, which can lead to performance problems, may become a hard task. Thus, the objective of this paper is to analyze the performance of MQTT brokers regarding latency in the data packets sending, and to present advantages and drawbacks of the solutions in Smart Cities scenarios. Results showed that the computer hardware features and the bandwidth used have a greater impact on the latency, showing that several factors can influence the performance of brokers. © 2019 University of Split, FESB.},

The applications involving the Internet of Things (IoT) concept have been growing around the world. Concerning the problems found in cities with large populations, the IoT applications aim technological solutions that improve the population living conditions. Most traffic light controller systems are locally programmed. In this case, to control all traffic lights in a city, besides to be a slow task, it is not possible to determine the traffic light's operating state. In some cases a centralized control is used, allowing information exchange with all traffic lights on the network. This paper seeks to study and develop a traffic light controller electronic circuit, with centralized control topology, able to communicate with other wireless network traffic lights. All characteristics of the designed circuit were evaluated by practical system control and monitoring tests. Finally, the electronic circuit proved to be viable in terms of smart cities applications. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {By monitoring crime incidence with quantitative techniques, many studies have shown that it is possible to improve decision making through pattern recognition and prediction. In a smart city scenario, such approaches can be used to compose analytical background to improve resource allocation. This work presents a novel framework to improve patrol planning that precisely provides places and times that are likely to be more dangerous than short-term average using a portfolio of machine learning algorithms. Our approach follows an algorithm-as-a-service architecture (AaaS), providing insights to existing public safety systems and platforms. The service comprises the broader ROTA framework, a robust public safety platform devised for the ongoing smart cities initiative of Natal, Brazil. Results of an experimental evaluation provided insights about spatial granularity effects on the performance of the estimators adopted. Furthermore, an evaluation on algorithm selection demonstrates its outcomes on the hotspot detection task. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the Smart Cities context, a plethora of Middleware Platforms has been proposed to support applications execution and data processing. However, just a few of them have explored the overall Smart Cities computing environment. The vast majority focuses on specific domains, typically presenting a sensor-acquisition architecture for processing in Cloud Computing. Most recent initiatives try to include Cloud Computing and Edge Computing, while few of them use the three computing levels (Cloud, Fog, and Edge). Besides, many of these platforms do not define the services that should be deployed at each level, nor how the developer can better use each feature. This work fulfills this gap presenting an architecture for applications classifying services implemented by a typical Computing Environment of Smart Cities. Our architecture uses all the computational levels (Cloud, Fog, Edge) of a city infrastructure, and it defines how to deploy each type of service at each level. We also present an example of the proposed architecture that we are implementing in the city of Natal, where some evaluative tests have been carried out. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Cities are becoming smart environments with the use of information and communication technologies (ICT). Data from these technologies are stored by various devices spread throughout the city and are available in open data portals, which can be used to improve essential services such as public transport and fed into platforms for visualization and analyses. Human and urban mobility analyses demonstrate that understanding movement patterns can assist governments in city’s decision-making process, as well as improve life quality of citizens. Aiming to enable mobility analysis in different cities, this work presents MODAL platform. This platform replicates mobility analyses and algorithms on databases of different cities using data obtained from open data portals. We assess the platform with a case study performing analyses of the transportation displacement within three different cities using complex network metrics. The results demonstrated the public transportation system efficiency showing regions of Chicago, Dubai and Taichung well served and regions which are key points to the transportation city interconnecting various areas. Moreover, we could evaluate how improved the transportation system would be by adding new lines or new transport system. The analyses demonstrated the platform potential to be used as support decision system for governments, showing the possibility of applying open data to improve city services and facilitate the conduction of analyses on various cities. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Although motivated by a research on how tight such parameters should be in a Fifth generation environment, the present study applies also to former networks generations, providing a framework of practical measures to handle a growing traffic close to or greater than nominal cell capacity, and, consequently, in this sense it may constitute a useful contribution to network management methods.

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) acts as an umbrella for the Internet-enabled devices for various applications, such as smart home, smart city, smart grid, and smart healthcare. The emergence of the immense economic potential necessitates a robust authentication mechanism that needs to be lightweight and suitable for real-time applications. Moreover, the physical integrity of these devices cannot be assumed as these are designed to be deployed in an unattended environment with minimum human supervision. A user authentication mechanism for the IoT, in addition to guaranteeing user anonymity and un-traceability functionality requirements, must also be resistant to device physical capture and related misuses. In this paper, we present a novel lightweight anonymous user authentication protocol for the IoT environment by utilizing 'cryptographic one-way hash function', 'physically unclonable function (PUF)' and 'bitwise exclusive-OR (XOR)' operations. The broadly accepted Real-Or-Random (ROR) model-based formal security analysis, formal security verification using the automated software verification tool, namely 'automated validation of internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA)' and also non-mathematical (informal) security analysis have been carried out on the proposed scheme. It is shown that the proposed scheme has the ability to resist various well-known attacks that are crucial for securing the IoT environment. Through a detailed comparative study, we show that the proposed scheme outperforms other existing related schemes in terms of computation and communication costs, and also security functionality features. Finally, a practical demonstration of the proposed scheme using the NS3 simulation has been provided for measuring various network performance parameters. © 2013 IEEE.},

Monitoring network performance is essential to network management and it also plays an important role in making better use of scarce resources. However, obtaining network performance metrics in WSN is not trivial due to energy and computational constraints on the WSN nodes. The main contribution of this paper is a performance monitoring module for IT-SDN, an SDWSN framework. This module collects information about the data packets transmitted, queue delay and available energy on the WSN nodes, and sends the information as requested by the controller. The results showed that the monitoring module neither impacts the delivery rate, delay and overhead of the network, nor the energy consumption of the node. Also, the data collected by the monitoring module is pretty similar to the real values. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Several smart city systems have focused on addressing a specific mobility problem scenario (e.g., air pollution, traffic jam) in a given city. The task of adding, extending, or porting the smart city scenario to other cities can be very challenging due to the rigid structure of such existing systems. To address this issue, in this paper we investigate common programming constructors that can be used to leverage the construction of such dynamic, smart city systems in the mobility domain. We propose Mensageria, a framework based on both the Complex Event Processing data-streaming processing paradigm and relational database management systems, which can dynamically deploy new or extend existing smart city scenarios in near real-time and maintain an updated dataset for provenance purposes. Mensageria provides several real-time primitives, such as filter, join, and enrich, that can be used to integrate, process, and analyze the city entities data streams. We discuss the generality, performance, and limitations of the proposed constructs through a real-world case study that was used in the Olympic Games of Rio in 2016 to detect, in real-time, existing and new situations that could affect the city mobility infrastructure. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Our proposal has two sequential steps: (i) the offline modeling step, where we model the outliers detection problem as a system; and (ii) the online modeling step, where the projection distance of each data vector is decomposed by a multidimensional method as new data arrives and an outlier statistical index is calculated. We used real data gathered and streamed by urban sensors from three cities in Finland, chosen during a continuous time interval: Helsinki, Tuusula, and Lohja. The results showed greater efficiency for the online method of detection of outliers when compared to the offline approach, in terms of accuracy between a range of 8.5% to 10% gain. We observed that online detection of outliers from real-time monitoring through the sliding window becomes a more adequate approach once it achieves better accuracy. © 2019 by the authors.

	abstract = {Smart Cities combine advances in Internet of Things, Big Data, Social Networks, and Cloud Computing technologies with the demand for cyber–physical applications in areas of public interest, such as Health, Public Safety, and Mobility. The end goal is to leverage the use of city resources to improve the quality of life of its citizens. Achieving this goal, however, requires advanced support for the development and operation of applications in a complex and dynamic environment. Middleware platforms can provide an integrated infrastructure that enables solutions for smart cities by combining heterogeneous city devices and providing unified, high-level facilities for the development of applications and services. Although several smart city platforms have been proposed in the literature, there are still open research and development challenges related to their scalability, maintainability, interoperability, and reuse in the context of different cities, to name a few. Moreover, available platforms lack extensive scientific validation, which hinders a comparative analysis of their applicability. Aiming to close this gap, we propose InterSCity, a microservices-based, open-source, smart city platform that enables the collaborative development of large-scale systems, applications, and services for the cities of the future, contributing to turn them into truly smart cyber–physical environments. In this paper, we present the architecture of the InterSCity platform, followed by a comprehensive set of experiments that evaluate its scalability. The experiments were conducted using a smart city simulator to generate realistic workloads used to assess the platform in extreme conditions. The experimental results demonstrate that the platform can scale horizontally to handle the highly dynamic demands of a large smart city while maintaining low response times. The experiments also show the effectiveness of the technique used to generate synthetic workloads. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Thus, there is a need to investigate the level of school performance, especially among high school graduates, who will be the ones who will most quickly enter the labor market. In order to compose the research data, the results of the SAEB large-scale evaluation of the year 2015 in the Portuguese Language and Mathematics proficiency were used. The data were collected, standardized and the results presented in groupings by levels, obeying a scale of 0 to 10. RapidMiner software was used for data mining and decision tree construction. The central objective was to identify the best predictive factors for students' performance equal to or greater than 350 points (level 6). The results showed that there is a significant percentage of students with scores lower than 225 points in the two proficiencies analyzed, considered by the government as a concern, since these students did not learn the necessary minimum. The decision trees demonstrated that the level of schooling of the parents or guardians of students can be considered important and fundamental factors for school performance. © 2019 IADIS Press.

Moreover, the new multicore architectures, besides its various cores, have a SIMD instruction set that can increase application performance when exactly the same operations are to be performed on multiple data objects. The aim of this paper is to efficiently execute the auction algorithm on these architectures. To achieve that, a vectorized version was implemented and evaluated. These versions were then run in parallel using the OpenMP library. Finally, to optimize the number of threads used during the execution, a malleable strategy is proposed and evaluated. Results show that the vectorized version outperforms the sequential one by a factor of 10, while the malleable vectorized version was able to adapt its execution to exploit the full potential of multicore architectures. © 2018 IEEE.},

Thus, practitioners need to be better prepared for these new systems. The area of Smart Cities (SC) is emerging and presents new challenges in conceptual, technical and academical degrees. This paper presents an experience report of SE practices in the development of SC applications. Five teams used the SC platform and developed their projects, creating software documentation, while applying agile practices. As a result, we identified that some UML diagrams were not adequate to model specific SC's aspects and microservices. Furthermore, we identified that there was a low application of the proposed agile practices, such as pair programming and daily meetings. Despite being the first time this class was taught, we identified gaps that need to be investigated in order to identify which SE practices are more adequate for such context. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is composed of different networked objects (i.e., smart devices) which are interconnected to gather, process, refine, and exchange meaningful data over the Internet. These objects are assigned to their respective IP addresses, and they are able to send and receive data over a network without any human assistance. IoT offers different types of applications, such as, but not limited to, smart traffic monitoring, smart home, smart health care and smart cities, to name a few. In a Cyber-Physical System (CPS), computing elements coordinate and communicate with sensor devices, which monitor cyber and physical indicators, and actuators, and also modify the cyber and physical environment where they run. The synergy of computational as well as physical components, specifically the use of CPSs, led to the advancement of IoT implementations. In a cloud-driven IoT-based big data environment, a cloud-based platform is used to store the data generated by IoT devices (normally by sensor devices) which further can be considered as a big data warehouse. This environment is highly scalable and provides important real-time event processing (for example, in critical scenarios like surveillance and monitoring of an industrial plant). In IoT-based critical applications, the real-time data access is obligatory as and when it is required. Such access is possible if we permit only authorized external users to access the real-time data directly from the IoT sensors. Sometimes authorized user may also request for big data query processing and big data analytics over the data stored in cloud servers to figure out hidden patterns of some phenomena (i.e., chances of fire in an industrial plant in future). Therefore, we need secure authentication schemes for cloud-driven IoT-based big data environment in which a legitimate user and an IoT sensor can mutually authenticate each other and establish a common session key for secure communication. In this context, this paper first discusses the network and threat models of the authentication schemes for cloud-driven IoT-based big data environment. Some security requirements, issues and challenges of this environment are then discussed. A taxonomy of various existing authentication schemes applicable for cloud-driven IoT-based big data environment is also discussed, which covers a comparative study of these schemes. We identify and briefly discuss some future research challenges in designing the authentication schemes and other security protocols for cloud-driven IoT-based big data environment that need to be addressed in the future. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Big Data analysis is attracting more and more developers and researchers, and at least five requirements (Velocity, Volume, Value, Variety, and Veracity) show challenges in deploying such solutions. Across the globe, many Smart City initiatives are using Big Data Analytics as a tool for doing predictive analytics which can be helpful to human well being. This work presents a generic architecture named Machine Learning in Microservices Architecture (MLMA) that provides design patterns to transform a monolithic architecture of machine learning pipelines in microservices with separate roles. We present two case studies deployed to a Smart City initiative, where we discuss how each component of the architecture applied in specific applications that use predictions with machine learning. Among the benefits of this architecture, we argue prediction performance, scalability, code maintenance and reusability makes such transition a natural trend in Big Data and machine learning applications. © 2019 IEEE.},

In this sense, the large development community that is being created around popular platforms is also contributing to the construction of Internet of Things applications, which can ultimately support the maturation of the smart-cities era. Popular platforms such as Raspberry Pi, BeagleBoard and Arduino come as single-board open-source platforms that have enough computational power for different types of smart-city applications, while keeping affordable prices and encompassing many programming libraries and useful hardware extensions. As a result, smart-city solutions based on such platforms are becoming common and the surveying of recent research in this area can support a better understanding of this scenario, as presented in this article. Moreover, discussions about the continuous developments in these platforms can also indicate promising perspectives when using these boards as key elements to build smart cities. © 2018 by the authors.

	abstract = {The maturation of Wireless Visual Sensor Networks (WVSN) in the last years, with new communication technologies and continuous releasing of embedded hardware development platforms, has significantly enlarged the number and relevance of visual monitoring applications, better supporting smart city and Internet of Things initiatives. However, there are still several challenges to be addressed, especially when visual sensors are used for critical monitoring. When availability issues are addressed in WVSN, different metrics and algorithms can be employed, but such approaches are usually focused on a single coverage goal. Actually, some monitoring applications may want to simultaneously optimize coverage over targets and areas alike, which requires an appropriate perception of the level of availability of the application at any given time. In this context, this article proposes a new availability metric for WVSN, considering that all targets and areas should be optimally and simultaneously covered by the cameras. In addition, optimization algorithms are proposed and compared, aiming at improving the availability of applications when rotatable visual sensors are employed. © 2019 IEEE.},

Accurate quantification would inform developers and municipalities in space allocation and design, while real-time measurements would provide drivers and parking enforcement with information that saves time and resources. In this paper, we propose an accurate and real-time video system for future Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cities applications. Using recent developments in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and a novel vehicle tracking filter, we combine information across multiple image frames in a video sequence to remove noise introduced by occlusions and detection failures. We demonstrate that our system achieves higher accuracy than pure image-based instance segmentation, and is comparable in performance to industry benchmark systems that utilize more expensive sensors, such as radar. Furthermore, our system shows significant potential in its scalability to a city-wide scale and also in the richness of its output that goes beyond traditional binary occupancy statistics. © 2014 IEEE.},

These systems are presented in different domains as connected health, industry 4.0, military, smart cities, smart grids, and smart agriculture. These systems are realized through the cooperation among heterogeneous, independent, highly distributed, individual, and heterogeneous systems to achieve their business goals. For the success of these larger systems, their individual parts must interoperate among them allowing the execution of more complex functionalities. However, there are many concerns that software engineers must overcome during the composition of these systems, that can be related to (i) the misunderstanding of data formats, data semantic, procedures, contracts, standards, quality, and interfaces structures provided by individual systems; and (ii) the absence of high-level architectures to analyze, comprehend, and guide how interoperability can be addressed. The goal of this work is to present a typology of existing and proven strategies for achieving interoperability. Strategies were identified through a systematic search in scientific databases and patterns repositories. The selected strategies were categorized according to the level of interoperability they support, namely, technical, syntactic, semantic, and organizational. In each level, the strategies were divided by the type of solution their propose, i.e., technique, and architectural styles, patterns, and tactics. Moreover, statements explaining how each strategy address interoperability are given. Results of this work can be used by architects to identify and understand solutions for achieving interoperability requirements during the composition of larger systems. The resulting typology in this study is the first step to consolidate a patterns-language for interoperability in software architectures. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

The increase of waste generation has been considered a significant challenge to large urban centers worldwide and represents a critical issue for countries with accelerated population growth in cities. The Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud computing offer an automation possibility through cyberphysical systems that will change the way solid waste management is performed. Considering IoT requirements, a review analysis of waste management models available in the literature is performed in detail in this paper. Then, a deep review is undertaken of the related literature based on IoT infrastructure for efficient handling of waste generated in urban scenarios, focusing on the interaction among concessionaires and waste generators (citizens) from the perspective of a shorter collection time with reduced costs, as well as citizenship promotion. An IoT-based reference model is described, and a comparison analysis of the available solutions is presented, with the goal to highlight the most relevant approaches and identify open research issues on the topic. © 2019 by the authors},

To this end, this paper describes the architecture, implementation, methodology, technologies, and the developed functionalities of the ChoroLibre tool. © 2019 IEEE.},

The merge of their features would allow the emergence of applications that transmit long-range data (up to 45 km) using low energy consumption, low manufacturing cost, and simplified implementation, eliminating mobile operators dependence. In this work, we integrate LPWAN and WPAN using LoRa and BLE in a paradigm of Fog/Edge Computing, allowing the execution of the procedures at the edges of the network, making possible the transmission of only consolidated data to the cloud. We implemented a LoRa-BLE testbed using Lopy4 - Pycon, and simulated SC scenarios using LoRaSim.

	abstract = {Resources of a city are urban assets such as hospitals and pharmacies (health facilities) or accessible ramps and adapted toilets (accessibility resources). This paper addresses the problem of resource management for smart cities combining crowdsourcing with gamification, and proposes a model called CORE-MM. This model allows the use of crowdsourcing techniques so that the management of cities resources is done by the citizens, without having to rely on an organization or public administration. To encourage participation in this resource management, this model also uses techniques of gamification. CORE-MM proposes the use of crowdsourcing integrated with gamification to manage the resources of a smart city, with two interdependent objectives: to motivate the use of the system by the users, and to encourage their participation in the sharing and management of information. The scientific contribution of this work is that CORE-MM treats the resource management considering a generic resources approach for smart cities. A prototype of CORE-MM was offered to volunteers and a questionnaire was developed to collect data and to evaluate the model, its performance and relevance. Results with volunteers indicated good perceived ease of use and good perceived utility. From the affirmations of the questionnaire that the 10 volunteers that tested the CORE-MM prototype had to answer, 91.67% agreed on the ease of use of the system and 8.33% manifested indifference in their responses. Regarding the utility of the system, 99.17% agreed and only 0.83% were indifferent. These results point to positive perspectives regarding the use of the application in possible situations and real locations. © 2019, IICM. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The plethora of emerging applications and their increasing popularity has led to the cloudification of the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT-cloudification scales up data centers to a high computational resource capacity, to suit the requirements of a large number of users wanting to access multiple services offered by revolutionary IoT applications which, in turn, consume huge amounts of data produced by billions of things. In such systems, IoT-tailored cloud services (e.g., software platforms and middleware) are responsible for running latency-critical IoT applications in different areas (e.g., healthcare, transport systems, safety, Smart Cities, and many others). These applications expect to produce high-density multimedia flows that must be handled appropriately by the underlying communication infrastructure to obtain transport services of the highest standard. In this work, we propose a novel control plane optimization, which leverages the support of the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) substrate so that it can advance beyond today's IP-based communication systems, which reveals weaknesses (e.g. a limited performance and scalability) in delivering multimedia content through per-flow channels. An attempt is made to overcome these limitations by proposing CLASSICO, a Cross-LAyer Sdn SessIon COntrol approach that exploits the SDN substrate to offload the flow streaming network-computing task from the IoT cloud platform to selected SDN branching nodes, and hence ensures high timeliness and scalability for the IoT-cloud system as a whole. To achieve this, CLASSICO dynamically builds application-layer sessions, which comprise multiple participant members sharing same interested content, and connects them into optimal multiuser tree structures, whereby only selected branching nodes apply SDN replication function for quality-enhanced transport service. We applied CLASSICO to a multimedia use case, and the results show that it outperforms multicast-capable IoT systems in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) video assessment metrics. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {A direct impact of population density is more cities suffering from constant traffic jams. Thinking this way, Intelligent Transportation Systems, a key area in smart cities, uses computational intelligence techniques and analyses to aid in traffic dimensioning solutions. In this context, accurate traffic prediction models are vital to creating a more autonomous and intelligent environment. With an increase in projects for intelligent cities, research in the area of computational intelligence becomes a necessity, since its models can address complex real-world problems, which are usually difficult for conventional methods. In this work, an application is introduced applying machine learning to empower a smart ecosystem. To validate it, an extensive evaluation was performed, comparing it with the state-of-the-art and, also, verifying the impact of parameter variation and activation functions on the model of traffic flow prediction. All evaluations were done using real data traffic of two very distinct scenarios. Firstly, a free traffic flow scenario was evaluated in a benchmark dataset. Then, both models were evaluated in a complex traffic scenario where traffic flow is not continuous nor large. In both scenarios, the presented application, called SmartTraffic, outperforms the current state-of-the-art, with a performance gain of over 100% when compared in the first scenario and an improvement of approximately 31%, on average, in the second one. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Context: Emerging paradigms like Internet of Things and Smart Cities utilize advanced sensing and communication infrastructures, where heterogeneity is an inherited feature. Applications targeting such environments require adaptability and context-sensitivity to uncertain availability and failures in resources and their ad-hoc networks. Such heterogeneity is often hard to predict, making the deployment process a challenging task. Objective: This paper proposes GoalD as a goal-driven framework to support autonomous deployment of heterogeneous computational resources to fulfill requirements, seen as goals, and their correlated components on one hand, and the variability space of the hosting computing and sensing environment on the other hand. Method: GoalD comprises an offline and an online stage to fulfill autonomous deployment by leveraging the use of goals. Deployment configuration strategies arise from the variability structure of the Contextual Goal Model as an underlying structure to guide autonomous planning by selecting available as well as suitable resources at runtime. Results: We evaluate GoalD on an existing exemplar from the self-adaptive systems community – the Tele Assistance Service provided by Weyns and Calinescu [1]. Furthermore, we evaluate the scalability of GoalD on a repository consisting of 430,500 artifacts. The evaluation results demonstrate the usefulness and scalability of GoalD in planning the deployment of a system with thousands of components in a few milliseconds. Conclusion: GoalD is a framework to systematically tackle autonomous deployment in highly heterogeneous computing environments, partially unknown at design-time following a goal-oriented approach to achieve the user goals in a target environment. GoalD has demonstrated itself able to scale for deployment planning dealing with thousands of components in a few milliseconds. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {A key component of fuzzy rule-based classification systems (FRBCS) is the fuzzy reasoning method (FRM) since it infers the class predicted for new examples. A crucial stage in any FRM is the way in which the information given by the fired rules during the inference process is aggregated. A widely used FRM is the winning rule, which applies the maximum to accomplish this aggregation. The maximum is an averaging operator, which means that its result is within the range delimited by the minimum and the maximum of the aggregated values. Recently, new averaging operators based on generalizations of the Choquet integral have been proposed to perform this aggregation process. However, the most accurate FRBCSs use the FRM known as additive combination that considers the normalized sum as the aggregation operator, which is nonaveraging. For this reason, this paper is aimed at introducing a new nonaveraging operator named CF-integral, which is a generalization of the Choquet-like Copula-based integral (CC-integral). CF-integrals present the desired properties of an aggregation-like operator since they satisfy appropriate boundary conditions and have some kind of increasingness property. We show that CF-integrals, when used to cope with classification problems, enhance the results of the previous averaging generalizations of the Choquet integral and provide competitive results (even better) when compared with state-of-the-art FRBCSs. © 1993-2012 IEEE.},

However, covering the whole city area with static sensors might be expensive. This paper addresses the utilization of the public transportation system as a mobility platform for sensor nodes and bus stops acting as sinks. This platform can improve the coverage of a sensor network and take advantage of opportunistic communication. Since this platform can be used for delay-constrained applications, we propose an algorithm to choose sensor sinks in the bus stops of a smart city that minimizes the maximum delay when delivering messages. We compare our solution with an optimal formulation and use real data, obtained in buses from Rio de Janeiro, as an input of our algorithm. Our experiments show that we can use approximately 16% of bus stops as sinks, having less than 10% of increase in the network maximum delay and no significant loss in the spatial coverage. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The challenges of urbanization require a new approach to manage the cities. Smart cities are a way to improve the citizen's quality of life through technologies. In this regard, the objective of this work was to identify which factors influence the acceptance of IT in public safety in the context of smart city. For this purpose, the qualitative approach was used, through semi-structured interviews with representatives of the Military Police and the Civil Police in Pato Branco-PR, in order to investigate thoroughly the constructs of the UTAUT model, proposed by Venkatesh et al. (2003). The main system cited by the authorities was the monitoring by cameras, called Safe Look Program. The results show that in the performance expectation, the monitoring system has quality images, which help in the people's identification. Concerning the effort expectation, the ideal would be the integration with the particular systems. Regarding the social influence, both police use social networks, by directing the sector, to publicize the work and make investigations. In relation to the facilitating conditions, there are difficulties with the functionalities of the monitoring software. With regard to smart cities, there are indications that the services are still in the process of being adjusted and they can be optimized. Furthermore, the participation of the citizen and the municipal administration is important in order to implement more services. © 2019 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Complex Event Processing (CEP) is one of the most important techniques developed for this purpose. In CEP, each new sensor measurement is considered an event and new event types can be defined based on other events occurrence. There exists several open-source CEP implementations currently available, but all of them use orchestration to distribute event processing. This kind of architectural organization may harm system resilience, since it relies on a central core (i.e. the orchestrator). Any failures in the core might impact the whole system. Moreover, the core can become a bottleneck on system performance. In this work, a choreography-based microservices architecture is proposed for distributed CEP, in order to benefit from the low coupling and greater horizontal scalability this kind of architecture provides. © 2018 IEEE.},

This process is slow, expensive and must be repeated several times manually by some institutions (operators and government regulatory entities) in order to optimize the network. On the other hand, there is currently a great interest in transforming cities into smart cities. One way to do that is applying some techniques related to Industry 4.0, which aims to improve industrial processes using enabling technologies such as IoT and Cloud Computing, automating processes and making them smarter. This paper aims to characterize these enabling technologies applied to the scenario of the telecommunication industry. In this sense, to improve the test drive, an architecture is proposed for monitoring the quality of service for mobile telephony, collecting RF parameters and processing in real time. In addition, a proof of concept of the system with free platforms is presented. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {With the development of smart cities, the demand for artificial intelligence (AI) based services grows exponentially. The existing works just focus on cloud- edge or edge-device cooperative AI which suffers low learning efficiency of AI, while edge-to-edge cooperative AI is still an unresolved issue. Moreover, the existing researches concentrate on the computation offloading of the AI-based task, ignoring that it is a brain-like task performing sophisticated processing to raw data, which leads to the high latency and low quality of the learning services. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an on-demand learning offloading mechanism for edge-to-edge cooperative AI. Firstly, the principle of the learning capability and its offloading are proposed for the formal description of the learning resources migration. Secondly, the proposed mechanism realizes the bilateral learning offloading utilizing edge-to-edge and cloud-edge collaborations to handle AI-based tasks with high learning efficiency and resource utilization rate. Moreover, we model the edge-to-edge learning offloading allocation based on the concatenation of deep neural network (DNN) subtasks and their heterogeneous requirement of learning resources. Simulation results indicate the rationality and efficiency of the proposed mechanism. © 2019 IEEE.},

This need becomes even more important and less obvious to supply when these data have discrepant events (i.e., outliers). Here we propose a method to explore the multiway nature of urban spaces data in outliers detection which includes three stages: (i) dimensionality reduction, where we model data as a 3rd-order tensor; from this reduction, we extract a set of latent factors to obtain the best fit for the next classification step; (ii) classification of latent factors, where the latent factors from the stage (i) are used to generate instances of similar events in monitoring smart urban spaces which result in high-quality clusters from the factorization; and (iii) combining steps (i) and (ii) to generate a refined urban space pattern identification model. We analyzed a real large-scale dataset with valuable data captured and streamed by urban sensors from 4 cities: Elda and Rois (Spain), Nuremberg (Germany), and Tallinn (Estonia).

There is a brief description of the urban issues and the sectors that involve this theme. Then it is reported on the need for new models to analyze the problems that involve the cities. In this way, the City Information Modeling tool is presented as a way to assist in the development of new proposals and the presentation of modern solutions to urban management issues. However, for the efficient operation of tools of this type it is necessary to integrate the most different types of data generated and made available in urban spaces. In this way, methodological proposals are made for further development of the final work where a data integration model will be generated for cities, with an application of this model in the city of Curitiba and possible implementations in other Brazilian cities, deepening the discussions about City Information Modeling and new forms of perception of urban problems to better model public policies. © 2019 Martins & Mendes Junior.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm aims to bring continuous interaction between small embedded devices and humans. The IoT has the potential to affect our daily lives and bring many benefits to society. Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWAN) is a new IoT technology that offers long distance connectivity for a massive number of devices. LPWAN is a promising solution to enable complex IoT scenarios, such as smart cities and smart healthcare. LoRa is currently one of the leading LPWAN solutions available for public use. Due to the great number of connected devices and, in some cases, sensitive data transmitted in IoT networks, security is one of the main concerns in LPWAN. In this paper, we focus on the issues of key management in LoRaWAN. We propose a secure architecture for key management based on private blockchain and smart contracts in order to increase the levels of security and availability in LoRaWAN environments. In order to show the feasibility of the proposed architecture, a working prototype was implemented using open-source tools and commodity hardware. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has become widely used in recent years in a wide range of applications, such as, weather condition monitoring, transportation, smart homes, smart cities, smart farm, etc. The ecosystem of the IoT is also vast, including from sensor and hardware devices up to cloud-computing. An approach that is getting more and more attention in the IoT ecosystem is the edge-computing and one of its fundamental pieces of equipment is the edge-computing gateway (GTW), which can working as a data-processing device nearer to the things and as a bridge to the Internet, as well. The most important features for these GTWs must be robustness and efficiency and a very popular solution is to use low-cost Raspberry Pi card-size computers. Considering protocol solution, Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) communication protocol has been considered one of the most applicable to IoT because of its low-power capability. In this context, this paper describes a study about the performance evaluation of a low-power member of the Raspberry Pi family, the Raspberry Pi Zero W, working as an IoT gateway and running MQTT. The experimental results show its performance using as metrics: the processor temperature, the CPU usage level, and rate of MQTT received messages under different Quality of Services (QoS). © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The development of crowdsensing-based technologies has allowed for the use of smartphones in large-scale data collection for different scopes of applications, mostly in a transparent and ubiquitous way. When concerning urban areas and smart city initiatives, the collection and further analysis of information about the highest number of vehicles is of paramount importance, potentially supporting more efficient mobility planning and management actions in modern cities. In this context, this article proposes a public general-purpose platform for acquisition and visualization of vehicular speeds, which can then be exploited by any additional application. For that, a crowdsensing-based mobile software application was developed to collect instantaneous speeds provided by smartphone GPS, formatting and distributing this information to a database system. Such historical data can then be exported or visualized through a web-based comprehensive interface, which provides valuable data when planning traffic mobility in cities; for example, indicating areas with heavier traffic over a certain time period. Therefore, allowing the use of many different search filters and supporting data delivery in the JSON format, the CitySpeed platform can provide services not supported by popular applications, such as Waze and Google Maps, and potentially assist smart city initiatives in this area. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Smart urban transportation management can be considered as a multifaceted big data challenge. It strongly relies on the information collected into multiple, widespread, and heterogeneous data sources as well as on the ability to extract actionable insights from them. Besides data, full stack (from platform to services and applications) Information and Communications Technology (ICT) solutions need to be specifically adopted to address smart cities challenges. Smart urban transportation management is one of the key use cases addressed in the context of the EUBra-BIGSEA (Europe-Brazil Collaboration of Big Data Scientific Research through Cloud-Centric Applications) project. This paper specifically focuses on the City Administration Dashboard, a public transport analytics application that has been developed on top of the EUBra-BIGSEA platform and used by the Municipality stakeholders of Curitiba, Brazil, to tackle urban traffic data analysis and planning challenges. The solution proposed in this paper joins together a scalable big and fast data analytics platform, a flexible and dynamic cloud infrastructure, data quality and entity matching algorithms as well as security and privacy techniques. By exploiting an interoperable programming framework based on Python Application Programming Interface (API), it allows an easy, rapid and transparent development of smart cities applications.  © 2013 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A smart city uses emergent technologies for improving the services that will contribute to make the citizens’ daily life more comfortable and convenient. Among several strand offered by a smart city, the smart parking systems focus the transportation and parking of vehicles problems, providing intelligent solutions based on ICT technologies, and particularly artificial intelligence techniques. In this context, a cyber-physical system, based on multi-agent systems, was developed for an intelligent parking system for car and bicycles. This multi-agent based system consists of a community of distributed, intelligent and autonomous agents, representing the parking spots and drivers, which cooperate to reach their objectives. In such systems, the global system behaviour emerges from the interaction between these individual entities, being crucial the adoption of the proper cooperation protocols. This paper studies and compares possible approaches to solve consensus problems in such distributed smart parking systems, and particularly addressing the negotiation strategies. For this purpose, the Contract Net Protocol, the English auction and the Dutch auction negotiation strategies were implemented in an agent-based smart parking system using the JADE framework. The experimental results allowed to perform a comparative analysis, considering the satisfaction levels of the actors, the scalability and the negotiation time to decide which approach better fits with the smart parking problem. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks are used to collect a large amount of data in the field and forward it to data collectors, which are also responsible to analyze such data for a particular purpose. However, the wireless communication is susceptible to noise and interference, which results in loss of information in the routes from the sensors to the data aggregators. In addition, the devices used in these networks have restrictions on their processing, storage, and communication capacity, which diminishes, even more, the reliability of the data delivery. Therefore, this work describes a new communication method named μNet, which aims to increase the delivery rate of packets in multi-hop WSN. Such approach is based on peer-to-peer control messages to ensure that the packet has been properly forwarded. Besides that, the μNet is designed to be compatible with constrained devices, reducing the size of headers of the protocols and the size of the network buffer. By comparing μNet with widely used WSN protocols, it is demonstrated that this approach results in better end-to-end reliability in networks susceptible to interference. © 2019},

Although there is still no consolidated concept, the concept of intelligent city is a proxy, formed by the acceptance and sharing of technology in a joint way, which in turn is represented by the union of several aspects of acceptance and sharing to individual level. Although speaking of smart cities seems a very distant topic for Brazil, some actions are already in operation, such as the Uber. Understanding individual perceptions of the user contributes to anticipate potential obstacles to an adoption of other Smart Cities initiatives. Thus, the objective of this study is to know the main discourses of Uber users in Brazil, paying attention to the role of information systems. To achieve this goal, a textual analysis is carried out with 142 records of the complaint platform here, to know the main complaints of the users adopting as approach the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT).

In terms of wireless communications technologies, Bluetooth low energy offers a robust, low cost, and low power consumption option. The recently published Bluetooth mesh profile specification addresses the most relevant challenges on that paradigm, adding secure multicast communications capabilities. A framework to create Smart Cities services was proposed and a traffic light service was used to demonstrate specification applicability for smart cities’ services. The proposed service showed that data may be collected and shared between devices in a mesh network through and over a metropolitan area.

To gather this evidence, nine sessions of Focus Groups were held with 43 people in total. Users of VR or AR applications, potential users and non-users were involved. The evidence obtained shows a plurality of entry barriers to decrease the lack of value perception related to applications using VR and AR. The majority of the sample shows a strong relation with theses technologies only with leisure and entertainment. Also some biases and less value of an immersive virtual reality for daily experiences or activities.

	abstract = {Technology is one of the sources of power more relevant in modern society. For that reason, technology is a social battlefield and a resource under power disputes. Technology is created and adapted to reproduce and incorporate society values as social groups who control technology creation. Thus, none technology is neutral or detached of a context. Instead, technology is an instrument used to change our society, at the same time that is reassembled by us. Considering that, critical theorist Andrew Feenberg elaborated the “Critical Theory of Technology” which discusses issues about technology in our society and the relationship between these two interrelated entities. Based on that, this paper critically analyzes the relationship of people with disabilities movements and technology and society changes, particularly with examples from the Brazilian context. We finish this research emphasizing the need for discussions and critical analysis about the democratization of technology and how this can provide a more equal and inclusive society. © 2019 IADIS Press.

	abstract = {Applications for intelligent transportation systems are springing up to bring many benefits to users during their journey through the use of vehicle traffic monitoring. However, testing and experimenting with real-world environments still poses a challenge for these applications since a realistic scenario of mobility is required. Typically, simulation tools use mobility trails to construct the network topology based on the mathematical formulation of a city mobility model, which attempts to emulate the real mobility of a given city. Another strategy is to use the real route of vehicles traveling to generate the model of mobility of a certain city; however, many studies available in the literature do not use the entire flow of vehicles that circulate in the city, acquiring data only of a small group of vehicles. Thus, in this work we intend to develop an infrastructure that would allow the extraction of the information of mobility from the vehicles of the countryside cities, in real time. This enables not only real-time vehicle monitoring but also the generation of traceability of real-time mobility. The results showed low battery consumption, as well as a low amount of mobile data usage. © 2019 IEEE.},

Many applications are possible when using smart devices capable of measuring, acting, processing and communicating.

By opening the specifications there is not a guarantee of well developed devices to keep the uninterrupted operation of the whole system. A set of many skills is required for the development of well implemented devices. In this scenario, a framework is proposed in this paper to uniformize some of the main functionalities of an IoT architecture.

	abstract = {Cognitive Radio (CR) is considered a key enabler technology for applications that require high connectivity (e.g., Smart Cities and Internet of Things), mainly because of its spectrum sensing function. In this way, CRs can sense the spectrum environment to select the best available channel for communication and they can, potentially, use licensed spectrum bands as a Secondary User (SU). However, CR has to vacate the licensed spectrum band as soon as a Primary User (PU) intends to use the channel. In this way, one of the most challenging topics in CR is the PU arrival prediction. Therefore, this paper presents a real-data study case of PUs arrivals prediction using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in CR. Herein, the Energy Detector (ED) is used to detect the presence of PUs. Our results show that the traditional method of combining the ED with the HMM may not be suitable in CR networks. © 2019 IEEE.},

This anonymity ensures that publishers and subscribers exchange information without knowing each other, which allows middleware to expand to a massive size on the scale of the Internet and Smart Cities.

	abstract = {Recently, Network Slicing in Radio Access Technologies (RATs) has been proposed as an approach to divide the wireless network infrastructure into isolated logical slices which are defined following their requirements and features in a service-driven way. To the best of our knowledge, the application of Network Slicing has not been explored in IEEE 802.11ah Networks. In this work, we propose a Virtual Network Slicing Broker (VNSB), a Virtual Network Function (VNF) instantiated inside a Software Defined Network (SDN) controller which communicates with an IEEE 802.11ah network Access Point (AP) via a southbound Application Program Interface (API). Based on information obtained by the northbound API, the slicing broker gets the information contained in the slicing templates, which describes the services features and respective Quality of Service (QoS) restrictions. With these data, the slicing broker makes logical slices in the context of the Restricted Access Windows (RAW) which are periodically sent by the AP to the stations (STA) via the Raw Parameter Set (RPS). Since there is no hardware with the IEEE 802.11ah standard available on the market, we validate the proposed solution through extensive simulations in a typical smart city scenario. Results showed the broker capacity to build and manage logical slices per service, respecting the QoS restrictions of each offered service. Moreover, the proposed slicing broker makes use of available resources of neighbor slices reducing delay, packet loss, and efficiently maximizing throughput per slice. © 2019 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The rapid increase in urban population poses significant challenges to the administration of cities throughout the world. However, with the widespread adoption of information and communication technologies (ICT), a growing number of initiatives are being implemented to alleviate such strain by attempting to transform urban centers into Smart Cities. Parallel to the concept of Smart City, a specific variation of this concept is emerging in the Tourism sector, which regards the idea of Smart Tourism Destinations (STD). In fact, mainstream tourism destinations are increasingly implementing ICTs to enrich tourists' experiences and, as a result, improve the competitiveness of the tourism destination. Despite the growing number of STD initiatives in different countries, the extant literature remains silent on this growing phenomenon. As such, the objective of this chapter is to propose a model—The Smart Destination Development Model—aimed at indicating a strategic path that a tourism destination should follow to become a smart one. As such, this chapter discusses the idea of STD, and argues that besides enhancing the destination competitiveness, an STD project should be grounded on a stainable paradigm in order to create public value for the hosting community. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.},

Even if these changes can strengthen the active role of society in the control and participation of public administration, there is a risk that this process can increase exclusion especially in developing countries, mainly because a large part of the population does not have access at all times to the facilities and services provided by ICTs. This article describes e-Totem, a software and hardware platform produced to support inclusive e-participation in large cities. It is also described three popular participation initiatives implemented using the platform, from which hundreds of thousands of citizen interactions were obtained from the platform. e-Totem is customized to be inclusive and suitable for use in such a wide variety of scenarios as well as being used by such a significant volume of people.

Although research on cyber-physical systems, cloud computing, embedded devices, sensor and actuator networks, and participatory sensing, among other paradigms, is driving the growth of solutions, there are a lot of challenges that need to be addressed. Based on these observations, in this work, we present an integrated system architecture for decision-making support and urban planning by introducing its building blocks (termed components): sensing/actuation, local processing, communication, cloud platform, and application components. In the sensing/actuation component, we present the major relevant resources for data collection, identification devices, and actuators that can be used in smart city solutions. Sensing/actuation component is followed by the local processing component, which is responsible for processing, decision-making support, and control in local scale. The communication component, as the connection element among all these components, is presented with an emphasis on the open-access metropolitan area network and cellular networks. The cloud platform is the essential component for urban planning and integration with electronic governance legacy systems, and finally, the application component, in which the government administrator and users have access to public management tools, citizen services, and other urban planning resources. © The Author(s) 2019.},

In order to make information about buses schedules in the metropolitan area of Recife accessible to people with visual impairment, an integration was developed between the Synesthesia Vision project and the public transport control system of the metropolitan region of Recife. Synesthesia Vision main subject is the development of technological solutions to help the locomotion of people with visual impairment with freedom and security. The Synesthesia Vision project consists of two subsystems: Sensory glasses and a mobile application. Sensory glasses are able to convert obstacles in the way of the user into 3D sound information that can be heard and positioned by their users. The mobile application is responsible by the sensory glasses control and it provides additional information about the environment, such as weather forecasting, the brightness of the environment and buses schedules and arrivals. The Synesthesia Vision project is based on two basic concepts: Ubiquitous computing (constant presence of information technology in ordinary people) and intelligent cities (use of technology to develop cities for people). The Synesthesia Vision integration with Recife's public transport control system increased the autonomy and freedom of movement of the blind, because the system, besides warning about obstacles in the way of the user, is able to alert, through sound warnings, about the schedules and arrivals of buses in the bus stop where the user of the system is. The results achieved were promising because volunteers indicated that the device gave more security to walk and go alone to buses stops. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).},

When the population density living in the same region increases more and more, the cities suffer from problems as constant traffic jams. Thinking this way, in this paper are present the uses of computational intelligence techniques and analyses to aid in traffic dimensioning solutions. To do this, prediction models and heuristics are the best way to create a more autonomous and intelligent environment. In this work, an application is introduced applying machine learning and an optimization technique to empower a smart ecosystem. To validate it, an evaluation using Multi-Layer Perceptron together with Particle Swarm Optimization was performed, comparing it with the state-of-the-art. All evaluations were done using real data traffic with a free traffic flow scenario. Applying the Particle Swarm Optimization to optimize the activation functions’ parameters, we obtained 3.1% average MAPE for Logistic activation function and a MAPE of 3.4% for ReLU activation function. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Historically, cities follow reactive planning models where managers make decisions as problems occur. On the other hand, the exponential growth of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has allowed the connection of a diverse array of sensors, devices, systems, and objects. These objects can then generate data that can be transformed into information and used in a more efficient urban planning paradigm, one that allows decisions to be made before the occurrence of problems and emergencies. Therefore, this article aims to propose a platform capable of estimating the amount of carbon dioxide based on sensor readings in vehicles, indirectly contributing to a more proactive city planning based on the monitoring of vehicular pollution. Crowdsensing techniques and an On-Board Diagnostic (OBD-II) reader are used to extract data from vehicles in real time, which are then stored locally on the devices used to perform data collection. With the performed experiments, it was possible to extract information about the operation of the vehicles and their dynamics when moving in a city, providing valuable information that can support auxiliary tools for the management of urban centers. © 2019 by the author.},

	abstract = {Edge computing takes computation away from the Cloud closer to the physical world. Therefore, it reduces the cost of communication bandwidth between IoT devices and the Cloud. However, Edge computing imposes certain limitations in computation power because due to poor hardware capacity of the devices. This restriction may significantly affect the performance of the deployed applications, especially Smart City applications. This limitations also could be aggravated by unpredictable human behaviors wich will easily make the Edge computation node overloaded. Osmotic computing is a new IoT application programming paradigm that provides an opportunity to balance the workload between Edge and Cloud therefore to overcome the load imbalance problem of Smart City applications. To this end, we propose an Osmotic Execution Framework that leverages state-of-the-art microservices techniques to deploy and execute a Smart City application in a distributed environment including Edge and Cloud. Finally, we evaluate load balancing through latency time analysis of our framework with a real-world smart parking application. © 2018 IEEE.},

With a qualitative approach through semi-structured interviews with commanders of two local police departments, this study investigated information orientation in the strategic decision-making process in the area of public safety in a small Brazilian city. The police departments have a limited ICT infrastructure to support the strategic decision-making process because their information systems are not connected. The results show that although the city of Pato Branco (Brazil) is considered a smart city in the area of public security, there are limited resources in several aspects of the police departments for the effective management of their ICT infrastructures. The impact of resource constraints reflects throughout the entire information use lifecycle - identification, collection, organization, processing, etc. - which fuels the strategic decision-making process. The implantation of an operations center could significantly reduce the effects of the problems identified in this research and further research may reveal the operational, technical, economic and financial viability of this proposal. © 2019 The Authors.

When multiple monitoring and automation systems are deployed, adaptive wireless sensor networks may adjust sensing and transmission configurations according to the detected events, optimizing the network overall operation. In this context, mobile sinks come as an effective way to enhance monitoring performance in smart city environments. However, practical issues related to the available roads and traffic load should be considered, allowing the computation of the best final positions and movement paths for each sink. Therefore, this paper proposes algorithms to compute dynamic sinks movement in reactive wireless sensor networks, supporting efficient adaptation to event-based monitoring in smart cities. © 2018 IEEE.},

License plate extraction is performed by a cascade of Haar-like features classifiers, built using the AdaBoost algorithm. Filters based on mathematical morphology prepare candidate plates for binarization and a simple threshold rule segments them. Characters are extracted by connected components labelling and are recognized by template matching. Results showed 81.75% of accuracy with average processing times of 210ms and 1304ms for computers with quad-core processors in frequencies 2.2GHz (Dell Inspiron 5588) and 900MHz (Raspberry Pi 2 model B), respectively. © 2017 IEEE.},

This algorithm exploits energy prediction and sets threshold rate of energy consumption to ensure accumulation of sufficient energy for non- energy harvesting period.

Besides easing such an integration, SGeoL allows correlating data with geographic information and it provides functionalities such as data aggregation, visualization, query, and analysis.

	abstract = {Global competitiveness is the main reality for cities in the entire globe. City rankings may bring to cities their reality in comparison to others, which can lead to some positive effects. However, one city should be compared to similar ones. In a previous work, we proposed a method based on financial indicators and clustering, aiming to turn possible to compare similar cities from financial perspective, due to its importance in the reality of a city. This work aims to present a literature review on the use of financial and economic indicators in smart city context. We used a method to construct a bibliometry on this theme, which is present in this work, as well as the obtained results. Hereafter, we present the main works related to our theme, and we finish our work presenting the list of most important financial and economic indicators that we found in literature. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {Devices of the Internet-of-Things such as sensors, actuators and smart objects are being incorporated into homes and companies to allow more interaction and communication. As new devices are introduced in IoT ecosystems, there is a need to improve control, security and infrastructure management, since network operators will not be able to know which devices are being used or whether network operations are being performed correctly for these devices. IoT ecosystems are heterogeneous, dynamic with the constant inclusion of new services and require interoperability. Environments with these characteristics present a challenge for any classification methodology. This paper shows a proposal for the construction of a tool for network monitoring that supports IoT devices traffic classification and identification. The proposed tool will provide three main functionalities: a network monitor, a passive classifier, and anactive classifier. © 2017 IEEE.},

However, the complexity exhibited by them has also increased, claiming for techniques to support their engineering and quality. In this direction, modeling and simulation (M&S) have been established as valuable resources to deal with such complexity, potentially supporting an accurate prediction of SoS software correctness. The main contribution of this paper is reporting the results and advances achieved in the last five years of research on the use of M and S techniques to support Software Engineering of SoS.

The architecture we are proposing has three hierarchical levels, and supports complex event processing (CEP) in several of them. At the lower layer, several mobile objects work as interfaces to sensors and actuators and provide processing capability for local filtering and detection. A second level, consisting of gateways and processing nodes, processes information from its locale and sends the data received from the mobile objects to the storage level using the existing network infrastructure. The highest level provides support for structured storage and queries of the information. Applications outside the platform can collect data through the external interface of the highest level. The system is under development using the InterSCity platform in the upper layer, the ContextNet middleware at the middle layer, and the Mobile-Hub application at the lower layer. It currently collects and processes data on buses running in the City of Rio de Janeiro. © 2018 IEEE.},

To understand the limitations and opportunities of this model, it is fundamental to investigate the spatial coverage of such a network, especially in the case where only a subset of the buses have a sensing device embedded. In this paper, we propose a model to select the right subset of buses that maximizes the coverage of the city. We evaluate the model in a real scenario based on a large-scale dataset of more than 5700 buses in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Among other findings, we observe that the fleet of buses covers approximately 5655 km of streets (approximately 47% of the streets) and show that it is possible to cover 94% of the same streets if only 18% of buses have sensing capabilities embedded. © 2018 by the authors.

Currently, some smart cities have been developing technological advances to monitor human health such as vital signs and movement. Movement is related to human gait, an independent and indispensable ability for locomotion. When this ability is desynchronized can be assessed by plantar pressure distributions. A footwear evaluation is useful to clinical gait analysis by diagnosing foot pathologies, enhances athletic training, as well as, wide public health promotion. This paper presents a custom portable pressure-sensitive foot insole to measure real-time plantar pressure in both static and dynamic activity monitoring, rehabilitation, gait, balance analysis, and its application in smart cities. 10 Force Sensitive Resistor (FSR) are attached to the insole. A stable data acquisition system interfaces in a wireless transmitter through Bluetooth connection to a computer/mobile receiver. This pressure-sensitive foot insole can integrate an online health database framework in smart cities for evaluation of several gait pathologies, next generation of rehabilitation, health promotion, and healthy public policy. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Many technological areas have been affected by the appearance of the internet of Things (IoT). This phenomenon is happening because applications such as smart cities, smart grids, smart buildings, smart homes, industry, transportation, healthcare and surveillance are being adapted to a new paradigm for adaptability, modularity, heterogeneity, scalability, optimization and decentralization. In this sense, several IoT architectures are being proposed for the applications that are inserted in this new technological development, with the most recent approaches being based on the Software Defined Network (SDN). Therefore, to follow this technological development, there is a need to implement the applications of control systems in this new scenario, which imposes challenges to be overcome, such as nondeterministic networks, latency, jitter, bandwidth, packet loss and interoperability. The focus of this work is on how to combine Distributed Networked Control Systems (DNCS) and IoT to meet this new technological context. However, the first step to be taken is to define the topology of IoT-based Networked Control Systems (IoT-DNCS), then develop a suitable system architecture to make control systems via the Internet of Things possible. Therefore, this article aims to propose a problem formulation and a simple and general architecture for IoT-DNCS, specifying the function of each element of the system according to the topology of the problem, and the organization of them to implement the control loops between sensors, controllers and actuators. The architecture proposed in this paper serves as a starting point for studies on new strategies and structures for network and feedback control systems. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {- With the movement of people from rural areas and small cities toward large cities, which accentuated from the beginning of the 19th century, public agents had to endure an ever a greater challenge in improving the creation and management of the different resources and services for the city. Nowadays, with the pervasive and ubiquity offered by the digital world, it has become possible to develop environments that permit an extremely thorough control of the elements and processes involved in this creation and management. The purpose of this paper is to analyze, understand and discuss the smart city. Here one review the contribution of the main researchers on the subject and present a basic working architecture for smart cities. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Agent-based Internet of Things (IoT) applications have recently emerged as applications that can involve sensors, wireless devices, machines and software that can exchange data and be accessed remotely. Such applications have been proposed in several domains including health care, smart cities and agriculture. However, despite their increased adoption, deploying these applications in specific settings has been very challenging because of the complex static and dynamic variability of the physical devices such as sensors and actuators, the software application behavior and the environment in which the application is embedded. In this paper, we propose a modeling approach for IoT analytics based on learning embodied agents (i.e. situated agents). The approach involves: (i) a variability model of IoT embodied agents; (ii) feedback evaluative machine learning; and (iii) reconfiguration of a group of agents in accordance with environmental context. The proposed approach advances the state of the art in that it facilitates the development of Agent-based IoT applications by explicitly capturing their complex and dynamic variabilities and supporting their self-configuration based on an context-aware and machine learning-based approach. © 2018 IEEE.},

We hope our solution-called SmartDoAMonitoring App-contributes to a more proactive DoA monitoring, thus increasing patient safety.

Water distribution systems (WDSs) in which databases can be updated every few minutes are no exception. Suitable techniques to evaluate available information and produce optimized responses are necessary for planning, operation, and management. This can help identify critical characteristics, such as leakage patterns, pipes to be replaced, and other features. This paper presents a clustering method based on self-organizing maps coupled with k-means algorithms to achieve groups that can be easily labeled and used for WDS decision-making. Three case-studies are presented, namely a classification of Brazilian cities in terms of their water utilities; district metered area creation to improve pressure control; and transient pressure signal analysis to identify burst pipes. In the three cases, this hybrid technique produces excellent results. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

By means of the frequency inverter, it is possible to reduce the motor rotation, when a set pressure is close to the expected value, preventing the motor from turning off and as the pressure decreases, the frequency inverter increases the motor rotation. If, for some reason, the process unstable, the redundancy system will shut off the engine. In addition, the implementation, in addition to raising the average supply pressure, ensured the reduction of pressure peaks, fuel consumption, number of engine units and energy costs.

A fact that started to be pointed out is that many of the apps developed in these civic apps competitions tend to be abandoned after the winners are announced. Different authors attempt to explain that phenomenon by arguing in different directions, alleging bad features, bad quality or lack investments from the cities organizing the contests, among other reasons. Evidence in academic research is mostly based on superficial research about the contests and interviews with organizers of these competitions. We wanted to gather quantitative data to measure the longevity of apps that eventually become abandoned, their perceived quality and the impact of the civic apps produced in these contests. In a case study of contests held by three big metropolitan cities in different countries, we surveyed a total of 122 apps that won prizes in 11 civic apps, from 2009 to 2015. We also interviewed organizers of the events to combine their perspective with our results. After checking app by app, we gathered information on which ones are still being used and estimated the impact based on different parameters such as the number of users, and the economic impact of those. This article presents preliminary findings of this study. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The video streaming services are already responsible for the majority of the Internet traffic. A good cloud-level architecture partially solves some issues related to the video streaming services. At the same time, however, it introduces new ones such as higher latency and core network congestion. In order to improve on this matter, this work proposes a multi-Tier architecture composed of a set of services to video streaming in a fog computing environment. It also takes into consideration classified hierarchical tiers and the ETSI-NFV architecture. The main goal is to design and assess a reliable and high-quality multi-Tier services architecture to be used in the Smart City environments. To this end, we introduced a set of video streaming services in the fog/cloud computing, and also proposed how these services may be used to improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) for end-users. © 2018 IEEE.},

In this way, the proposal of this work is based on the capture of information through sensors in a smart city context. Sensors are coupled on a bicycle and connected to an Arduino and a Mobile Application. After this, the captured data are saved in a cloud database, displayed and analyzed through a Web Application. In this work, our methodology is organized in three main phases: (i) data collection of the surface in which the cyclist is traveling, and the ultrasonic distance sensor, to identify areas of risk based on the proximity of objects from bicycle, (ii) data analysis and data classification, using machine learning concepts and (iii) data visualization, using map views in a Web Application. This methodology allows the identification of injury risk situations to cyclists. The main contributions of this work are surfaces classification with data collected by the accelerometer and ultrasonic sensor generating useful information through simple data. Real experiments were conducted at Fortaleza (Ceara, Brazil) and Aracati (Ceara, Brazil). This work brings new perspectives to collaborative data collection for identification of injury risk situations to cyclists, since it can be used to suggest routes based on these risk indicators and offer a secure environment for cyclists. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart cities encompass a complex, diverse, and rich ecosystem with the potential to address humanity's biggest challenges. To fully support society demands, many emerging technologies should be gracefully integrated. Current architectures and platforms frequently address specific topics, requiring intricate coordination of partial solutions. In this context, interoperability of technological solutions is mandatory. Examples include interoperability of IETF standards (e.g., 6LowPAN, RPL, CoAP to other IEEE standards, such as 802.15.4, and Bluetooth). Designs based on these protocols are being largely employed worldwide. However, they have some limitations that deserve our attention. Recent examples, such as ramsomware and DDoS attacks, are concerning many people on the suitability of our current stacks. NovaGenesis (NG) is an alternative architecture for TCP/IP that has been already proofed. In this chapter, the NG model for smart cities is explored, presenting its benefits. Recent results in NG are summarized and discussed on the proposed scope. © 2018, IGI Global.},

An Intel Galileo board was connected to the camera to perform image processing and send the estimated distance to a web server where the system user could access the data. A prototype was built to perform an evaluation of the system, the experiments were made in a reduced-scale model and in a real docking process. An average error of 1.62% was obtained in the reduced model while the accuracy in the real scenario cannot be measured yet, due to the lack of a precise instrument of comparison between the exact and the estimated distance in the dock. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Since the concept of smart cities was introduced, there has been a growing number of surveys aiming to identify the dimensions that characterize them. However, there is still no consensus on the main factors that should be considered to make a city more intelligent and sustainable. This report contributes to the topic by identifying the most important smart city drivers from the perspective of professionals from four broad areas of expertise: applied social sciences, engineering, exact and Earth sciences, and human sciences, which provide important insights for the understanding of smart and sustainable cities. In this study, we conducted a wide and detailed literature review, in which 20 potential smart city drivers were identified. The drivers were prioritized from the results of a survey conducted with 807 professionals that work in the concerned field. The results showed that the seven drivers identified as the most important to increase the intelligence of cities are related to the governance of cities. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Smart cities is an emerging concept that allows the usage of technology to improve the quality and efficiency of services delivered to the population of a given city, considering a vast application domain. Some applications, like smart surveillance using Internet of Things sensors demand the transmission of high amounts of traffic with strict quality of service, what may not be available at all times. One solution to deal with this traffic overload is to implement the concept of resources sharing. Considering this context, in this article, a heterogeneous network scenario is considered to implement a multi-purpose real time video surveillance application which can be applied to both smart cities and military surveillance such as borderline security. The proposed solution considers three crucial aspects: the QoS requirements of the real time video application; the cost-benefit of the spectrum allocation; and the time constraints involved in a vertical handover operation to avoid interference. The main contribution of the article are: (I) inclusion of a multilevel resources broker in the Smart Cities architecture, (II) a QoS-enabled solution for video surveillance to provide borderline security, and (III) a low overhead control mechanism to avoid interfering with the legitimate network traffic. Results obtained via simulations show that after the proposed solution is implemented delay and jitter are kept below their specific thresholds and therefore the QoS is guaranteed considering the coexistence of up to 500 IoT sensors. Nearly 70% of the traffic is accommodated either in IEEE 802.11 or IEEE 802.22 networks, which offer relatively low cost resources. These results are also compared with two state of the art related works and show that the proposed solution performs better than the related work in the analyzed scenarios. Finally, with respect to the time constraints, the implementation of the proposed solution leads to fast vertical handover, attaining times up to 46% lower than the maximum allowed handover duration. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

While in recent years many IoT-based reasoning systems have already been proposed, there are no comprehensive results reporting their performance, particularly in complex environments. As an answer to that challenge, developers often choose an architecture design based on previous experience that have an impact on the system performance and scalability. This paper shows experimental results of a performance analysis study of different implementations of context-aware management architectures for IoT-based smart cities. Results show that different architectural choices affect system scalability and that automatic real time decision-making is feasible in an environment composed of dozens of thousands of sensors continuously transmitting data. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Current smart city scenarios are strongly related to the use of wireless communications for providing a ubiquitous and pervasive network. The used wireless network devices are nodes with several restrictions in terms of hardware, energy, and communication. Due to these limitations, the selection of the appropriated routing protocol represents an important task in order to seek an efficient network. Although the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is used in a great variety of smart city applications, recent studies have been identifying some drawbacks and limitations of this protocol. In this context, the Lightweight On-demand Ad hoc Distance-vector Routing Protocol (LOADng) can emerge as an important alternative to RPL. The LOADng is a reactive routing protocol continuously used and evaluated in various network scenarios, but its performance in a smart city network was not studied yet. Hence, this work presents a performance evaluation study considering the use of LOADng in a smart city scenario. The routing protocol was evaluated using different routing metrics aiming to define the most appropriated one for a smart city application. The LOADng and the various routing metrics described in the paper were evaluated considering the packet delivery ratio, latency, number of hops, spent energy per bit, and network energy consumption. The results express that LOADng can present an efficient performance in applications with constant periodical data messages, but it is decreased when the messages are sent sporadically. © 2017 IEEE.},

Precision farming is increasingly essential for the sustainable development of agriculture. The automation of information management and data collection in agriculture through sensor networks is extremely important for the sustainable agriculture development. These data guided this project that had the objective of developing a wireless, flexible and simple sensing system that can be applied in any environment, transmitting its information to a central where the data can be stored and analyzed, besides providing a more accurate irrigation system for saving water resources. This project did not aim at the analysis of sensor data, but only the tests with modules of radio frequency transmission working with microcontrollers. This study allowed the development of a system with low energy consumption, using the ZigBee communication protocol with wireless Xbee modules, and conducting tests involving soil temperature and soil moisture measurements, also making possible through the collected data, future academic studies in the agronomic area. © 2017 IEEE.},

This work proposes a novel method to detect events in Twitter based on the calculation of entropy of the content of tweets in order to classify the most shared topic as an event or not. We observed that the entropy of the bigrams extracted from tweets are subject to a continuous phase transition when social media users start to react and interact with an event that is taking place. Hence, we propose a method to detect this phase transition, and consequently detect an event, and extract the keywords related to the corresponding event. We compared the performance of our method to other approaches of the literature and we observed that our method is the more regular among three metrics and reached the best overall performance. Furthermore, we present evidence that our method is very sensitive to correctly detect events that occur almost at same time. © 2018 IEEE.},

In IoT domain, healthcare has been highlight due to the growing demand of the population for monitoring people belonging to health risk groups. In this paper, we propose an approach for monitoring people who are part of risk groups, for example, sedentary people, using IoT technologies. Our approach monitors users' physiological data through wearable devices and sends this data to a computational cloud. In the cloud, these data are processed, stored and presented to the healthcare professional, who will monitor and establish new activities for the user.

	abstract = {A large number of vehicles routinely navigate through city streets; with on-board sensors, they can be transformed into a dynamic network that monitors the urban environment comprehensively and efficiently. In this paper, drive-by approaches are discussed as a form of mobile sensing, that offer a number of advantages over more traditional sensing approaches. It is shown that the physical properties of the urban environment that can be captured using drive-by sensing include ambient fluid, electromagnetic, urban envelope, photonic, and acoustic properties, which comprise the FEELS classification. In addition, the spatiotemporal variations of these phenomena are discussed as well as their implications on discrete-time sampling. The mobility patterns of sensor-hosting vehicles play a major role in drive-by sensing. Vehicles with scheduled trajectories, e.g., buses, and those with less predictable mobility patterns, e.g., taxis, are investigated for sensing efficacy in terms of spatial and temporal coverage. City Scanner is a drive-by approach with a modular sensing architecture, which enables cost-effective mass data acquisition on a multitude of city features. The City Scanner framework follows a centralized IoT regime to generate a near real-time visualization of sensed data. The sensing platform was mounted on top of garbage trucks and collected drive-by data for eight months in Cambridge, MA, USA. Acquired data were streamed to the cloud for processing and subsequent analyses. Based on a real-world application, we discuss and show the potential of using drive-by approaches to collect environmental data in urban areas using a variety of nondedicated land vehicles to optimize data collection in terms of spatiotemporal coverage. © 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {There is increased interest in smart vehicles acting as both data consumers and producers in smart cities. Vehicles can use smart city data for decision-making, such as dynamic routing based on traffic conditions. Moreover, the multitude of embedded sensors in vehicles can collectively produce a rich data set of the urban landscape that can be used to provide a range of services. Key to the success of this vision is a scalable and private architecture for trusted data sharing. This paper proposes a framework called SpeedyChain, that leverages blockchain technology to allow smart vehicles to share their data while maintaining privacy, integrity, resilience, and non-repudiation in a decentralized and tamper-resistant manner. Differently from traditional blockchain usage (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum), the proposed framework uses a blockchain design that decouples the data stored in the transactions from the block header, thus allowing fast addition of data to the blocks. Furthermore, an expiration time for each block is proposed to avoid large sized blocks. This paper also presents an evaluation of the proposed framework in a network emulator to demonstrate its benefits. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

This leads cities to face an ever greater challenge in providing suitable management of the different resources and services necessary to attend their citizens. The development of the modern city with their huge amount of vehicles and saturation of people caused the development of even greater stress to cities population, with extreme stress conditions occurring with respect to urban mobility. In fact, the citizen finds the streets congested, insecure and overcrowded by a polluted environment (air, visual and noise pollution). For this reason it is necessary to study, develop and implement alternatives of managing mobility to improve the quality of life of people leaving in cities.

With the advent of smart cities, some countries began to face this problem with technologies, such as Smart Water Grids. However, with this proposal it is intended to contribute with the smart cities context but with a nondestructive and less complex system. Also, it is proposed in this paper the use of the q-sigmoid function that is an alternative to pre-processing step to digital image processing. The potential of this function will be validated as method to contrast enhancement and to highlight regions of interest. The proposal was applied in thermal images captured from the soil surface with an underground water leak. Such conditions were proposed into a laboratory, using an ideal model with sandy soil. The results obtained from this experiment were promising, since it was able to detect leaks at early stages of the experiment, which suggest a potential use of the methodology and the proposed preprocessing technique to detect water leaks. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In recent times, smart communities such as-smart grid, smart healthcare, and smart manufacturing units consists of large number of connected devices equipped with advanced processing and communication capabilities. The focus of these smart communities have shifted towards the use of intelligent processing and control for providing better quality of service (QoS) to the end user domain. To support this aspect, software defined networking (SDN) is being widely deployed in different domains such as-data center networks, fog/edge computing, smart grid, and vehicular networks. The variable requirements of different applications in smart communities make it necessary to deploy flexible and scalable SDN. The dynamic flow management capability of SDN has lots of potential that needs to be effectively explored in order to provide QoS guarantee for traffic generated from different smart applications. In this direction, in this paper, an ensembled scheme for QoS-aware traffic flow management in SDN is designed. The proposed scheme works in three phases: 1) a linear ordering scheme for dependency removal of the incoming packets is designed, 2) an application-specific traffic classification scheme is designed, and 3) a queue management scheme is designed for efficient scheduling of traffic flow. The proposed scheme is evaluated over an experimental setup. The results obtained shows that the proposed scheme behaves effectively with respect to different QoS parameters. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {In the present era of smart cities and homes, the private information of the patients such as their names, address, and disease is being breached on a regular basis, which indirectly related to the security of electronic health records (EHRs). The existing state-of-the-art schemes handling the security of EHRs have resulted in data being generally inaccessible to patients. These schemes struggle in providing the efficient balance between the data privacy, need for patients, and providers to regularly interact with data. Blockchain technology resolves the aforementioned issues because it shares the data in a decentralized and transactional fashion. This can be leveraged in the healthcare sector to maintain the balance between privacy and accessibility of EHRs. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based framework for efficient storage and maintenance of EHRs. This further provides the secure and efficient access to medical data by patients, providers, and third parties, while preserving the patient private information. The goals of this paper are to analyze how our proposed framework fulfills the needs of patients, providers, and third parties, and to understand how the framework maintains the privacy and security concerns in the healthcare 4.0. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {According to the Getùlio Vargas Foundation - FGV (2015), Smart Cities are people interacting and using energy systems, materials, services and financing to catalyze economic development and improved quality of life. These interaction flows are considered smart for making strategic use of infrastructure, services, information and communication with urban planning and management to meet social and economic needs of society. According to Berrone (2016), the 10 dimensions indicate the level of intelligence of a city: governance, public administration, urban planning, technology, the environment, international connections, social cohesion, human capital and the economy. Thus, this study is proposed here address two of these topics: governance and economy. To Araúhajo (2002), the term governance as the ability of a government has to design and implement their policies this ability refers to the financial sphere, managerial and technical, while governance implies the conditions the exercise of political is based on the analysis of these dimensions that see the role of social cohesion so necessary for the construction of a structure and culture of smart cities. Once appropriating this culture, economic development will be the reflection of that interaction. According to Nakagama, cases successful in smart cities as Australia, show that generating real business results of short-term, especially as the government encouragement (tax incentives and access to credit), provides a creative economy, able to retain talents in local companies with good revenue. Thus, this paper aims to make a thematic focus on what public policy strategies that drive the construction of smart cities in order to verify the impact of public policies and this study the importance of public engagement in governance: identify talent retention strategies and analyze the socio-economic development. Thus, a descriptive and exploratory methodology grounded in case study of governance practices in Australia will be applied, these practices opposed to the Brazilian. © 2017 IEEE.},

Multiple smart vehicle applications are being conceived these days, including road traffic, road safety and infotainment, all of which are suffering from the WAN-latency problem. In this paper, we propose a Vehicular Adhoc Network (VANET)-based Software-Defined Edge Computing infrastructure supporting content delivery services among connected vehicles. The proposed approach leverages network base stations to embed mobile edge computing (MEC) services closer to the vehicles. Our approach can enable the delivery of more competitive services with reduced-latency by utilizing cooperative MEC search strategy for vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications as well as utilizing vehicle-level caching for vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communications between peers. The framework prototype has been implemented as a clean extension of the Mininet-WiFi emulator. Preliminary results serve as validation of the proposed framework and point out the potential benefits of the approach in mitigating WAN-latency in VANET. © 2018},

The data was collected by a software agent, installed at the users' smartphones, which monitors detailed usage of applications. First, we look for general patterns of how users access some of the most popular mobile applications in terms of frequency, duration, diversity, and data traffic. Next, we mine the dataset looking for temporal patterns in terms of when and how often accesses occur. Finally, we exploit the location of each access to detect users' points of interest and location-based communities. Based on the results, we derive a model to generate synthetic datasets of mobile application usage and evaluate solutions to predict the next application to be launched.We also discuss a series of implications of the findings regarding telecommunication services, mobile advertisements, and smart cities.

Logic-based systems makes possible to take advantage of a wide framework for formally verify this domain. Proof assistants are logic based computational tools developed to mechanize the construction of proofs and Coq, among others, plays an essential role in software validation. This work is tailored to show a way to reason over these models as Finite State machines formalized in the Coq proof assistant from which it is possible to provide certified software to the Smart Cities domain. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Due to its wide applicability, wireless sensor network (WSN) has been used to collect data in the field and forward it to a data collector. However, WSN relies on unreliable communication medium that is susceptible to noise and interference, which results in loss of information through the route to the data aggregator. Unlike existing TCP and UDP protocols, a new transport protocol is required to meet the specifications of a wireless sensor network. In order to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) in the communication medium, this work describes a new communication protocol, which aims to guarantee the delivery of packages. Such protocol uses a new transmission acknowledges system, providing higher reliability in peer-to-peer transmissions. With this method, it is shown that even without a network buffer, it is possible to achieve better reliability in harsh environments than others well-known methods. In this way, this protocol guarantees the end-to-end data delivery, using a minimum amount of device memory. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Efficient urban mobility proved to be a major challenge for smart cities. A better use of the urban traffic infrastructure is key in the effort of mitigating the effects of traffic congestion. Popular approaches range from classical control and optimization to multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). This paper follows the latter track. Challenges here are manifold. First, most of the literature assumes that either traffic lights learn (while drivers do not change their behaviors) or viceversa. Second, no matter what kind of class of learning agents is considered, their actions are highly coupled (thus making the learning task harder). Third, when both classes of agents co-learn, these learning tasks are of different nature (from the point of view of MARL). Finally, a microscopic modeling and simulation of the this problem is not trivial. Therefore, this paper not only proposes a co-learning approach in which agents act in a shared environment, but also argues that this task needs to be formulated asynchronously. Besides, driver agents are able to update the value of the available actions by receiving information from other drivers. Results show that the co-learning approach outperforms other policies in terms of average travel time of all vehicles. Moreover, when co-learning is used, a better distribution of the trips within the network is observed. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Traffic Lights Signaling Optimization consists in optimizing traffic-light cycle using optimization algorithms. In this context, a traffic simulator can represent different road intersections and traffic lights and can calculate traffic quality measures. A solution to this problem can be encoded in a vector representing the time of each traffic light on the simulator and the objective functions are the traffic quality metrics. Since there are several metrics this problem can be defined as a many-objective optimization problem. In spite of the existence of several objective functions, the majority of the related work selects a small set, often two. This paper proposes a manyobjective optimization framework based on objective reduction to solve Traffic lights Signaling Optimization Problem. Here, twelve objective functions are used. To deal with the high number of metrics, objective reduction techniques are applied along a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. An experimental set is conducted to analyze if it possible to reduce the number of objective functions on the Traffic lights Signaling Optimization Problem and if this reduction enhances the performance of the optimization algorithm. © 2018 IEEE.},

This occurs in part because the concept of LL is still in development, does not have clear boundaries, and the discussion around the theme transcends many disciplines. We have faced some of these uncertainties when a customer asked us to develop a LL environment for Smart Cities. This scenario motivated us to perform a mapping study with the purpose of characterizing LLs, their challenges, domains where they can be applied, and software architecture aspects related to the theme. As result, 51 primary studies were identified and six aspects of them were analyzed: LL characteristics, application domains, LLs smart cities initiatives, challenges, and current evidence on software architecture for LL. The results are beneficial for both researchers and practitioners. For researchers, this work provides information about the current status of LL research, as well as topics that require further investigation. For practitioners, the paper discusses challenges that they need to be prepared to face when developing LLs, as well as aspects related to software architecture and considered application domains. The organized set of information can support development teams on the conception of new LLs. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart Transportation Safety (STS) envisions to improve public safety through a significant paradigm shift in today's reactive way that police authorities respond to crimes to a pro-active one. The application of smart surveillance in STS allows automatically identifying potential security threats in the target environment with agility and accuracy. Fog computing promises to enhance the cloud smart surveillance enabled STS systems, by avoiding the additional latency rates raised by the round trips to faraway data centers. In this paper, the FISVER framework is proposed to apply new ICT paradigms in smart surveillance capable STS systems to enhance crime assistance. Through FISVER, in-vehicle fog and Fog systems interwork to provision autonomous crime detections and real-time crime assist at bus service. FISVER's prototyping over a real testbed raises evaluation outcomes that demonstrate its essential contribution to mission critical situations, highlighting outstanding system performance and mobile device survivability rates in comparison to a typical STS use case. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) aims to connect billions of smart objects to the Internet, which can bring a promising future to smart cities. These objects are expected to generate large amounts of data and send the data to the cloud for further processing, especially for knowledge discovery, in order that appropriate actions can be taken. However, in reality sensing all possible data items captured by a smart object and then sending the complete captured data to the cloud is less useful. Further, such an approach would also lead to resource wastage (e.g., network, storage, etc.). The Fog (Edge) computing paradigm has been proposed to counterpart the weakness by pushing processes of knowledge discovery using data analytics to the edges. However, edge devices have limited computational capabilities. Due to inherited strengths and weaknesses, neither Cloud computing nor Fog computing paradigm addresses these challenges alone. Therefore, both paradigms need to work together in order to build a sustainable IoT infrastructure for smart cities. In this article, we review existing approaches that have been proposed to tackle the challenges in the Fog computing domain. Specifically, we describe several inspiring use case scenarios of Fog computing, identify ten key characteristics and common features of Fog computing, and compare more than 30 existing research efforts in this domain. Based on our review, we further identify several major functionalities that ideal Fog computing platforms should support and a number of open challenges toward implementing them, to shed light on future research directions on realizing Fog computing for building sustainable smart cities. © 2017 ACM.},

	abstract = {The rapid progress of urbanization creates great challenges for urban planners. These challenges include the environment, energy consumption, transport, and other areas. The massive amount of information generated everyday in urban environments allows more precise diagnostics of the problems and helps in the design of solutions. Since such sources of information are heterogeneous and involve a large amount of data, major computational challenges arise. The objective of this work is to propose techniques and methods that allow the integration and visualization of urban data from multiple heterogeneous sources, aiming to create tools for urban data analysis, focusing mainly on transportation and transit. We propose the Urban Transit Fingerprint visualization, in which the geometry, length and duration of travels within a city can be compared, and indicators of the relative eiciency between private (individual) and public (mass) transport can be assessed. Data from Belo Horizonte and São Paulo, Brazil, are analyzed using the proposed technique as case studies. Results show wide discrepancies in the efort a public transit user has to make for her mobility in various regions of each city, as compared with individual travel. These results help explaining the sharp drop in the number of transit users over the last years, thus calling on urban planners to devise public policies in the search for better solutions. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

A case study in the area of education was chosen to present a view of the modeling in archimate language. Five enterprise architecture implementation methodologies were reviewed. Eleven axes were recognized and compared with other methodologies to evaluate the maturity level of city governance. This led to a questionnaire of diagnostic assessment to identify the maturity level in city councils. This method generated the score of each axis, which allowed visualization of the maturity model of council governance. The results showed that the organizations diagnosed in relation to the eleven defined axes are between 11.43% and 58.22%, with the objective of reaching 100% for a high-performance rate in relation to the enterprise architecture. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

In order to bring a safer environment to its public of more than 60,000 daily users, a smart public safety system is being developed. This is a complex system, spread throughout all the University's campuses. It is composed of a smart surveillance cameras system, a back office system with a workflow engine and a mobile application within a collaborative concept. The smart cameras system is being deployed and the mobile application together with the back office system is being used this past year with satisfactory results. The mobile application is the user entry point to report several security and campus maintenance related issues that are automatically directed to the responder team for immediate action in the case of security or enters an automated workflow engine in the case of campus maintenance. This paper presents the structure created towards achieving a smarter public safety environment, details of the implementation, presents statistical data collected by the system showing its effectiveness and concludes showing the improvements introduced in the university community safety and welfare. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Big data are a key enabler for smart cities and local communities willing to offer more tailored services and resources to citizens. One of the biggest challenges in a long-running big data platform for smarter cities lies in the real capacity not only to drill into the data, but also, and most importantly, to leverage existing social and geographical ties between all main actors of local communities, which range from normal citizens and people to economy stakeholders, non-profit and social organizations, and government and administrative staff. The platform should let them use (and disclose) among themselves those pieces of information they do not want to publish globally (e.g., on Facebook and Google), but would be willing to share and interweave locally (e.g., through an easy-to-use community portal). In addition, if the advent of Web 2.0 technologies simplified both the consumption and the production of new contents (e.g., through highly interactive wiki-like pages), they considerably enable additive services. A notable example is the metering of the digital footprint and traces left by users as they interact with these platforms, useful to further enhance the user experience by providing automatically adapted mashups of local community services/data. We describe how to exploit these socio-technical aspects by integrating them in a new semantic-enabled big data platform specifically designed for the local community smart city scenario called LocalFocus. The article also reports some experimental results collected with a first in-the-field deployment of the LocalFocus in Imola, namely, the ImolaInRete community portal, which has already involved more than 800 citizens since its launch in January 2017. © 2018 IEEE.},

Data were collected from a structured interview and from the 2013-2016 social media report released by the city hall. Results reveal that the local government uses social media applications for broadcasting institutional information and service information, for service delivery, and crowdsourcing practices. The research analysis concluded that the city of Curitiba uses social media as a strategic digital city resource for strengthening citizen engagement by envisaging different crowdsourcing practices and some novel content and action-driven strategies as storytelling, piquing curiosity, the use of memes, pop culture, the creation of characters, nicknames, among others. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart city is a concept and a strategy used to address problems derived from rapid urbanization. Initially focused on the smart use of information and communication technology, the concept has broadened its horizons and is now seen as straightly connected to the concept of sustainable development. The dissemination of green energies sources, such as wind power, is connected to the premises of sustainability and has found fertile winds in Brazil, particularly in small and poorer cities. This paper aims to analyze if the expansion of wind energy is being capable of pushing these small cities into a sustainable development path and, thus, to become smarter cities. A review of the literature provides the key features to analyze these cities. The main conclusion is that despite of a huge increase in tax revenue, there is an erratic movement in the cities, revealing that improvements in one area are not necessarily associated to better performance in others. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The paradigm of the post-industrial society of the 21st century, based on the diffusion of knowledge through Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), coupled with the growing demands of contemporary society, exposes public management in an open and transparent scenario of thought-provoking challenge concerning the effectiveness of its actions. This scenario requires efforts from the public manager in order to reorganize its institutional arrangement, inserting innovations that allow the systematic competitiveness not only of the public sector, but of the other participating members of the urban experience. In the meantime, the concept of Human Smart Cities presents itself as a push element of transformation that aims to overcome this gap through the fruitful articulation and interaction of the public admnistration, the universities, the business and financial sectors and other members of civil society [1], using ICTs as the connectivity tool between these elements and the management of the co-design and co-creation activities. Such a transformation to innovate democracy requires an effort from the main players regarding the need to actively participate in the vision, strategy and implementation of the goals that characterize a Human Smart City that the authors present as a contribution to face the current Brazilian crisis. Given this context, the present study seeks to present strategies, methodologies and best practices for sensitization, civic engagement, social empowerment and sustainable motivation to participate in the co design and co-creation of a Human Smart City. Therefore, a systematic analysis was conducted, illustrated with the best practices implemented in the Natal Human Smart City Program. Living Labs are used as a methodological basis for the Urban Living Lab - the engine of the city's socioeconomic development - based on its innovation ecosystem, illustrated by the collaboration between the City Hall of Natal and the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), through the Digital Metropolis Institute (IMD). © 2017 IEEE.},

This work, for example, proposes an application in the context of smart cities to analyze data intelligently, knowing that, the concept of Smart Cities involves a wide range of innovations created for the comfort of the citizens. This paper proposes, through data collection, the recognition of vibratory patterns for the classification of surfaces using machine learning techniques. This is an important issue, as it offers a proposal for greater security of bicycle circulation points with the identification of possible irregularities. The analysis of roads surface quality is possible with the use of an accelerometer to collect data important for the audition of tracks. This data is then classified generating information, classified as patterns (asphalt and pavement surfaces). We have performed field data gathering and applied algorithms calculations to classify data to identify the surface the bicycle ridden, with results in percentages of accuracy up to more than 96%. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {The ever-progressing advancements in urban growth and technological development in recent decades have caused a noticeable increase of the phenomenon of socialenvironmental deterioration, leading to a decline in quality of life, reduction of social welfare and difficult urban mobility for people living in cities. The concept of Smart City can be used to mitigate several of the challenges arising from the aforementioned issues, relying on multiple tools and techniques (such as crowdsensing) to gather essential context data about how actual citizens consume resources and commute throughout their everyday lives. In this paper, we show how an urban mobility data analytics tool may help to determine the most visited regions and interconnections in an urban area. This information has been obtained using data gathered from a pool of users participating in a crowdsensing campaign, using the ParticipAct Brazil platform. The obtained results confirm the reliability of the information produced, highlighting the regions with the highest concentration of people during the geolocation monitoring process and their connections; therefore, this data may be used to plan possible future changes to how the city allocates its resources, to better suit the mobility needs of its citizens. © 2018 IEEE.},

Public (or pervasive) displays allow passersby to engage in dynamic and interactive experiences. However, in order to successfully deploy a new public display, a careful analysis is required, because there are many factors to take into account, such as visibility, interactivity and follow up. The present study used qualitative methods to elicit participant's impressions about places around the university campus. Map sketching and contextual interviews were conducted with ten graduate students from University College London. A thematic analysis was used for coming up with suggestions regarding this user group. This paper also contributes with a summary of factors from the literature findings that can help identifying potential locations for other similar case studies. Finally, the data provided interesting insights about current users' impressions about the adverts on campus and other existing public display, which can be very useful for novel endeavours in the advertisement industry. © 2017 IEEE.},

One of them is the development of techniques and services capable of contributing to the enhancement of security public policies. Finding criminal patterns from historical data would arguably help in predicting and even preventing thefts and burglaries that continuously increase in urban centers worldwide. However, accessing such history and finding patterns across the interrelated crime occurrences data are challenging tasks, particularly to underdevelopment countries. In this paper, we address these problems by combining three techniques: We collect crime data from existing crowd-sourcing systems, we automatically induce patterns with relational machine learning, and we manage the entire process using scientific workflows. The framework developed under these lines is named CRiMINaL (Crime patteRn MachINe Learning). Experimental results conducted from a popular Brazilian source of data and a traditional relational learning system shows that CRiMINaL is a promising tool to induce interpretable models that can assist police departments on crime prevention. © 2018 IEEE.},

Because of their pervasiveness, online social networks provide data and become real-Time sensors of society. This work looks at Twitter to reveal the hidden relationship of languages that stems from users' language preference for writing their tweets. We show that the language relationships are dependent of place by comparing 12 large-scale datasets with different locality levels. For instance, the secondary language of French speakers in Canada is different from French speakers in France. We used network science and clustering techniques to find that languages groups are more driven by spatial than syntactic proximity. The characterization of language relationships is key to the understanding of information spread in social media and the detection of cultural shifts. © 2017 IEEE.},

The impacts of traffic congestions or inefficient transit connectivity directly affect public health (emissions, stress, for example) and the city economy (deaths in road accidents, productivity, commuting, etc). In parallel, the advance of technology has made it easier to obtain data about the systems which make up the city information systems. The result of this scenario is a large amount of data, growing every day and requiring effective handling in order to be transformed into integrated and useful information. This article aims to analyze the urban public transportation from the perspective of open data and data science. We focus on data integration challenges for smart city applications and present an use case of data usage to speed limit enforcement. We also present an initial comparative analysis of New York and Curitiba data collection and processing approaches. The results unveil challenges to overcome regarding file formats, reference systems, precision, accuracy and data quality, among others, that still need effective approaches to easy open data exploitation for new services. We discuss data characteristics that can possibly be used to optimize public transportation systems aiming at standards for transportation data worldwide. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {A Service-Level Agreement (SLA) usually refers to computational services (e.g., cloud/web services), indicating contract goals and expected Quality of Service (QoS), recently extended for transportation problems called Logistics SLA. Transportation problems are being systematically studied for Smart City (SC) applications due to its huge importance: Public transportation services, drone delivery services, battery recharging for electric vehicles, and also transportation for private companies considering real-time traffic information. Many of these transportations problems involve not only one-way deliveries, but also pickups, forming a set of routes with desired QoS such as maximum route length/time, delivery/pickup sequences and timewindows. In order to achieve all desired QoS, while minimizing routing distances, this problem can be seen as an extension of the challenging Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), which is known to be NP-Hard. Computational intelligence strategies such as metaheuristics are often employed to find near-optimal solutions in short computational times. In this paper, we deal with a practical industrial problem involving employees transportation to a workplace in a Brazilian metropolis, involving minimization of operational costs, achievement of QoS requirements and visualization of the routes. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Contemporary software systems, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Industry 4.0, and Smart Cities are new technology paradigms that offer challenges for their construction since they are calling into question our traditional form of developing software. They are a promising paradigm for the integration of devices and communications technologies. It is leading to a shift from the classical monolithic view of development where stakeholder receive a software product at the end (that we have been doing for decades), to software systems materialized through physical objects interconnected by networks and with embedded software to support daily activities. We need therefore to revisit our way of developing software systems and start to consider the particularities required by these new sorts of applications. This paper presents research toward the de8inition of a framework to support the systems engineering of IoT applications, where we evolved the Zachman's Framework as an alternative to the organization of this architecture. The activities were two folded to address this goal: a) we identi8ied leading concerns of IoT applications, recovered from technical literature, practitioners and a Government Report, in different studies; b) we structured the IoT paradigm in different facets. These activities provided 14 signi8icant concerns and seven facets that together represent the engineering challenges to be faced both by research and practice towards the advancement of IoT in practice. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Tree fall is a major issue in large cities as it may obstruct roads and lead to traffic jams, and even injure people. Following these kind of incidents, monitoring the environment through sensors and Internet of Things technologies emerges as an important preventive approach. Another point is that the net primary productivity has a sensitive relation with trees characteristics including plant respiration and net photosynthesis which are highly sensitive to temperature. The health of the tree can then be monitored through leaf transpiration, sap flow measurement, environment evaluation as these methods offer indicators on any chance of a fall. The solution proposed in this paper includes an open-design hardware setup for monitoring trees in Smart Cities with Internet of Things. The setup is connected to a Smart City platform aiming to facilitate the use by other researchers and botanics, specially. Therefore, we noticed that the daily sensing data results in a huge amount of information that requires a balance between Big Data and Edge Computing approaches to process the whole collected data. The evaluation of the sensing data is presented together with the proposed architecture. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The integration of Cloud Computing and Internet of Things (IoT) is foreseen as an enabler to suit a plethora of novel latency critical applications (e.g, e-health, intelligent transportation, safety, energy, smart cities, and many others). These applications require multimedia (mainly video) flows to be handled by the underlying network in an efficient and scalable way, as they expect to consume a massive data produced by billions of things. In view of this, we propose a dynamic multiuser session control plane which leverages 5G's support of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) substrate to advance beyond todays limited, per-flow IP-based communication systems. We handle such limitations by proposing CLASSICO, a Cross-LAyer Sdn SessIon COntrol architecture that exploits SDN to offload the flow streaming computation operations from the IoT cloud platform to the network edge, affording high timeliness and scalability for the IoT-cloudified system. CLASSICO dynamically builds Application Layer multiuser data sessions and maps them into enhanced group-enabled data paths featuring SDN replication at branching nodes. We applied our solution to multimedia-alike use case, and results show that CLASSICO outperforms typical SDN-enabled IoT systems in terms to Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) video metrics. © 2018 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Urban traffic simulators are valuable tools for prior and low-cost evaluation of modification proposals for road networks, aimed at improving vehicular mobility. The system covered in this article, called PetGyn, falls into this category. It is powerful enough to represent scenarios of changes in the structure of road networks and/or in the behavior of their elements (pathways, traffic lights, possible conversions, etc.) and for predicting road usage levels (volume and traffic speed). In addition, PetGyn's flexibility allows the employment of different traffic allocation models (system optimization, user equilibrium, etc.), various types of cost functions (from the classic BPR - Bureau of Public Roads - arc cost functions to non-separable and asymmetric functions) and the simulation of different behaviors for the road network components (blocking routes according to schedules/days, reversing the direction of traffic flows, allowing/forbidden parking along the lanes, among others). Since its conception, it was built in a modular way so that it can be easily adapted to the urban traffic particularities of any country. Unlike commercial systems in this area, PetGyn was developed under a free software philosophy and as a web-based system in order to favor collaborative work. Its usage allows the study of intervention projects for mediumsized metropolitan regions, contributing to identify possible improvements in urban mobility. © 2017 IEEE.},

By nature, smart environments are heterogeneous, considering the plethora of available technologies, and middleware can thrive, playing even a more relevant role in large environments, such as smart cities. This paper explores the differences between connecting conventional and IoT devices to the Internet, while highlights the theoretically ideal operation of IoT middleware modules.

Some challenges identified in the development of solutions for this context are: scalability, modularity and security. Goal: Testing activities are critical to the verification and validation of Smart City solutions, so our goal is to develop a map of test strategies for applications developed in the context of Smart Cities. Method: For this study we defined a systematic literature review protocol to identify, select, analyze and synthesize the results of previously published empirical studies in the software engineering literature, related to testing Smart Cities applications. Results: In this systematic mapping, 13 articles were selected, that have identified test strategies used by developers for the application testing process. We have also identified some difficulties faced in the process of testing these applications through reports present in the works selected in this mapping. Conclusion: Our research synthesized evidence that we hope might serve as a data source for academic research and industrial practice. As future work we plan to apply our results highlighting a case study in real applications to validate the collected evidence. © 2018 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

Specifically, the study of data-driven solutions to understand the behavior of cities and propose services to enhance the experiences of the citizens in their everyday life has become an active research topic. Many studies in this topic focus on exploring single data sources, and, to tackle this limitation we propose the SMAFramework to collect and integrate urban mobility data from heterogeneous sources. In this work, we propose a methodology that enables the standardization of spatiotemporal annotated data from sources such as Sensor Networks, Vehicular Networks, Social Media and the Web over a single data model (i.e., a Multi-Aspect Graph) and perform different analyses, such as the identification of taxi demand. To show the potential of this framework, we built and assessed a tool to evaluate spatiotemporal correlation of urban data from different sources. Real data collected from social media and a taxi system of the city of New York are used to evaluate this method. The obtained results allowed us to understand some of the applicabilities of the SMAFramework and also provided some insights on how to use it to resolve specific problems when analyzing mobility in urban environments. Using this methodology, we can obtain a better taxi positioning within the city by employing social media data. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Open Government Data has been made available by public institutions in Brazil and the world, and can add value to various sectors of society. Open data is also linked to smart cities, and hence important in this context, as it is the first step towards public transparency. Despite the wide range of Open Government Data, interpreting such data sets is a non-trivial task, due to the massive amount of raw data. This stimulates the search for techniques and methodologies that allow the interpretation of implicit information and deduction of new knowledge. One of the approaches used for these tasks involves the use of data visualizations. In addition to data visualizations classically used in descriptive statistics for data analysis, such as line or bar charts, many web sites have been used map visualization techniques. This type of visualization is important, since visualization of georeferenced data combined with other types of information can aid its interpretation. However, for data visualization construction on maps, it is necessary that the objects to be visualized are georeferenced. There are standards for turning such data available, however they are diverse, which may make it difficult for a single tool to display views from different sources. This work aims to present a framework that defines data standards for constructing data visualizations on maps of various types. Based on this framework, a tool was implemented to facilitate the creation of different map views, both by developers of open data portals and by users who analyze such data. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

In the proposed framework, two primary users (PUs), PU1 and PU2 coexist with a secondary user (SU) in the same frequency band albeit with different priorities. Primary users by virtue of having a license to operate over the frequency band have higher priority than secondary user. When bidirectional communication between PU1 and PU2 is not possible due to link failure or deteriorating channel conditions, PUs seek the assistance of the secondary user. SU by acting as a two-way AF relay helps in forwarding the information from PU1 to PU2 and vice-versa, in exchange, it is allowed to access the PU's spectrum. Our analysis shows that two-way relaying helps in improving the spectral efficiency and reducing the outage probability of primary and secondary user. Good agreement between theoretical and simulation results validate the analytically obtained expressions. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Sorting is one of the fundamental operations of Computer Science. Many problems, such as plasma real-time diagnostic, image re-ranking, and suffix array construction, require that we sort several arrays in the form of matrix lines or array segments. We define this type of task as segmented sorting. Considering the importance of this problem, the main goal of this study is to provide insight into different techniques for solving it, while also answering the question 'What is the best performing strategy?' for different combinations of array lengths and segment sizes. In order to perform segmented sorting, we can either call a sorting procedure for each of the array segments or use an implementation specialized in this operation. As an alternative, we explore an approach named fix sort, which adjusts the array to allow off-the-shelf general sorting algorithms to perform segmented sorting. We implemented and compared different methods to sort multiple segments in a shared memory environment using CUDA. Throughout our experiments, we noticed a great variation in performance when using the MGPU and CUB libraries, the bitonic sort from CUDA samples, the fix sort-based strategies, and a radix sort procedure called for each segment. The tests showed that using fix sort can be favorable in some cases, and enabled us to create a guideline for efficient implementation of segmented sorting routines based on the parameters of array lengths and number of segments. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Making cities smarter is usually achieved through Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-intensive solutions, which can be employed to collect and analyze large amounts of information generated by several sources, such as sensor networks, traffic systems, and citizens' devices. However, integrating different technologies and information to build smart city applications and services remain a challenge as different sources of heterogeneous data need to be considered. These data can be also enriched with geospatial information, thereby generating cross-sector value-Added information while contributing to better planning actions in the urban space. In this context, we introduce a data integration approach upon Smart Geo Layers, a geospatial-based data middleware aimed to unify data provided by several sources in smart city environments. Along with geo-graphical information regarding the city physical space, Smart Geo Layers provides aggregation, visualization, and data analysis functionalities. In this paper, we describe the Smart Geo Layers middleware, its implementation, and its application through an urban planning application within the smart city initiative of Natal, Brazil. © 2017 IEEE.},

As the literature continues to grow the number of indicators and frameworks for “smartness” are becoming more robust and perspectives on what makes a city smart continue to evolve. This exploratory research analyzes text from 51 Wikipedia articles that describe cities considered “smart” according to three globally recognized and independent rankings of cities. By comparing findings on word frequencies and word associations found in Wikipedia articles with terminology found in academic literature on smart cities, this study intends to determine to what extent data about smart cities produced through Wikipedia's crowdsourcing approach relates to theoretical developments in the field. This inductive approach may open avenues to the application of automated text analysis methods in theorizing and empirical efforts with information produced about smart cities. This exploratory work may facilitate conceptual understanding of the properties and features of smart cities and may also open avenues to future applications of alternative conceptualization methods. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

One of the most promising methods for security and trust amongst vehicular networks is the usage of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). However, current implementations of PKI as a security solution for determining the validity and authenticity of vehicles in a VANET is not efficient due to the usage of large amounts of delay and computational overhead. In this paper, we investigate the potential of PKI when predictively and preemptively passing along certificates to roadside units (RSU) in an effort to lower delay and computational overhead in a dynamic environment. We look to accomplish this through utilizing fog computing and propose a new protocol to pass certificates along the projected path. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.},

	abstract = {Smart cities emerge as a topic to cover how the technology of information and communication can be used in the urban centers to monitor its dynamics and allow the improvement of services for the citizens. In these urban centers, different methodologies are used in order to collect data and provide them to applications. These data come from several heterogeneous sources, thus there is an effort to integrate and standardize them before their use. Also, a significant amount of this data has spatio-temporal annotations, which may be used to analyze the city dynamics, such as the mobility flow. Due to these characteristics of the data generated in urban centers, and also the possibilities brought by their use and analyses, this work presents a novel approach to collect, integrate and perform some analysis tasks in mobility data from smart cities. Thus, the SMAFramework can analyze mobility patterns based on a Multi-Aspect Graph (MAG) data structure. To show the potential of the framework, it is proposed a method to analyze the saptio-temporal correlation between data from two different data sources in the same city. Real data collected from social media and a taxi system of the city of New York are used to evaluate this method. The obtained results allowed to understand some of the applicabilities of the framework and also provided some insights on how to use the framework to resolve specific problems when analyzing mobility in urban environments. © 2017 ACM.},

	abstract = {The use of interactive technologies to aid in the implementation of smart cities has a significant potential to support disabled users in performing their activities as citizens. In this study, we present an investigation of the accessibility of a sample of 10 mobile Android" applications of Brazilian municipalities, two from each of the five big geographical regions of the country, focusing especially on users with visual disabilities. The results showed that many of the applications were not in accordance with accessibility guidelines, with an average of 57 instances of violations and an average of 11.6 different criteria violated per application. The main problems included issues like not addressing labelling of non-textual content, headings, identifying user location, colour contrast, enabling users to interact using screen reader gestures, focus visibility and lack of adaptation of text contained in image. Although the growth in mobile applications for has boosted the possibilities aligned with the principles of smart cities, there is a strong need for including accessibility in the design of such applications in order for disabled people to benefit from the potential they can have for their lives.

	abstract = {Smart Cities is a world-wide initiative leading to better exploit the resources in a city in order to offer higher level services to people. In this context, urban computing is a process of acquisition, integration, and analysis of big and heterogeneous data generated by a diversity of sources in urban spaces, such as sensors, traffic devices, vehicles, buildings, and humans, to tackle the major issues that cities face, e.g. air pollution, increased energy consumption and traffic congestion. The majority of these information can be represented as graphs, such as the transportation network, in which places (nodes) are connected by some form of public transportation (edges). A vision of the 'city of the future', or even the city of the present, rests on the integration of science and technology through information systems. This vision requires a re-thinking of the relationships between technology, government, city managers, business, academia and the research community. This position paper presents our views towards developing techniques for querying and evolving graph-modeled datasets based on user-defined constraints. Our focus is to show how these techniques can be applied to effectively retrieve urban data and have automated mechanisms that guarantee data consistency. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Sensor networks have become ubiquitous – being present from personal smartphones to smart cities deployments – and are producing large volumes of data at increasing rates. Distributed event stream processing systems, in its turn, are a specific kind of systems that help us to parallelize event processing. Therefore, they provide us capabilities to produce quick insights and decisions, in near real-time, on top of multiple data streams. However, current systems for large scale processing do not focus on Internet of Things and Sensor Network workloads, which makes the performance decrease quickly as the workload size increases. In order to process large scale events with acceptable latency percentiles and high throughput, special systems are needed, such as distributed event stream processing systems. In this work, we propose an architecture for Internet of Things data workloads, in a combination of sensor networks data sources and distributed event stream processing systems, focused on smart grid data profiles. In our evaluations, the system was able to process up to 45K messages per second using 8 processing nodes, while providing stable latencies for micro-batches above 30 seconds. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

	abstract = {The technological empowerment of cities as a way of facing challenges to their sustainability and quality of life of population has gave rise to the realization of the smart city concept. Smart cities typically encompass several distributed systems engaged in complex relationships, including the integration and interaction with other systems towards providing new functionalities. However, these systems are highly heterogeneous, developed with different technologies and data formats, and owned by distinct organizations and agencies within the system, thereby challenging the development of value-added applications. A way of addressing these issues is by holistically viewing a smart city as a system-of-systems (SoS), a set of complex systems with their own purpose and collaborating with each other to fulfill common global missions. In this perspective, we herein discuss how smart city systems could be holistically viewed as a complex SoS. We also shed light on some challenges related to the development of this type of systems in the context of smart cities. © 2017 ACM.},

This has been promoted by recent evolution in telecommunication technologies, together with an exponential increase in using sensor-enabled mobile devices on a daily basis. The construction of Mobile Health Communities (MHC) supported by Mobile CrowdSensing (MCS) is essential for mobile healthcare emergency scenarios. In a previous work, we have introduced the COLLEGA middleware, which integrates modules for supporting mobile health scenarios and the formation of MHCs through MCS. In this paper, we extend the COLLEGA middleware to address the need in real time scenarios to handle data arriving continuously in streams from MHC’s members. In particular, this paper describes the novel COLLEGA support for managing the real-time formation of MHCs. Experimental results are also provided that show the effectiveness of our identification solution. © 2018, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

	abstract = {Bike share systems have been implemented in many cities to provide an alternative low-cost environmentally friendly and healthy public transportation. Citizens can pick up and drop off bikes among stations around the city. The system may be used for both work-related and leisure purposes including supporting last-mile transportation and tourism. In order to sustain and attract more users into the bike system, understanding demand and trip patterns is a key objective. Further, due to the asymmetric and dynamic nature of user demands, some stations tend to run out of bikes whereas other stations tend to be full (impeding returns). Rebalancing stations to provide high quality services to fit pick up and drop off demand is a major challenge in bike share systems. In this paper, we present a three-layer SMARTBIKE system to assist city administrators in Fortaleza, Brazil with bike share system decision making. This is an international cooperative effort between academia and government to aid in building a Smart City. The first layer of the proposed tool includes ¿-means clustering technology to understand the true demand of the city bike share system. We designed a novel station network analysis in the second layer to provide insights on system usage patterns and to help with the rebalancing strategy. The third layer provides rebalancing support at the facility and operation level. Finally, we discuss a dynamic visualization tool to support decision making. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Actually many Internet of Things (IoT) applications and architectures are being deployed in order to support urban area applications, as for example smart cities. However, other important applications are being deployed in rural areas, as for example agribusiness, in which wireless connectivity is one of the most important issues because wireless broadband commercial technologies are not sustainable from the business model view. In order to attend the actual demand of rural areas, the present work proposes two study cases that optimize coverage and low energy consumption joining LTE and LoRaWAN wireless access technologies. The proposal architecture is based on an element called Intelligent Terminal (IT), which is a gateway that is composed by LTE and LoRaWAN interfaces. The first study case represents a terrestrial vehicular case and the second one represents an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) case. The terrestrial study case is used as a reference to get a quantified gain of using UAVs. Considering that every scenario has particularities in terrestrial relief characteristics, it was obtained coverage information of five scenarios with different radius. When the radius coverage is increased, usability of UAV becomes more important. In average, for radius equal to 45 km and an UAV height equal to 50 m the gain of using UAVs is equal to 2 times the coverage than using a terrestrial solution.

This innovation in urban infrastructure of cities and the impacts of intensive application of technology are still being identified and mapped. A fundamental aspect under technological viewpoint to make this novelty a reality, and most comprehensive as possible is related to communication networks. Concept of Internet of Things (IoT) only materializes through a combination of technologies based on private and public networks and the Internet as the main platform. Utilities companies have already started their participation in this process in sense that they are deploying smart grids using technologies like RF Mesh and PLC, being RF Mesh the most widespread in world markets. But it is necessary to insert smart grid projects in the context of smart cities and in its converging alternatives of communications infrastructure. This work explores an emerging technology named as Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) and proposes that this is the current alternative best suited to the big scenario of IoT, in which smart grids are included, and also compares with the RF Mesh technology widely adopted for this application. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Sensor networks are a fast-evolving technology used for a variety of applications, ranging from environmental monitoring to cyberphysical systems (CPS) and IoT, including applications designed to support smart cities. The widespread use of sensor networks rises new challenges to data management and storage. The development of data storage systems is a hard task due to the specific nature of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and the lack of a common general purpose development framework. Software component models provide an appropriate level of system abstraction, reducing the development complexity and improving productivity. In this paper we propose RCBM, a Reusable Component-based Model for wireless sensor network storage simulation. RCBM promotes software reuse from existing components to improve the efficiency of system development and evaluation. RCBM has been implemented on the NS2 simulator and experimental results show that RCBM is more flexible than previous component-based models for WSNs. Due to its general-purpose approach, RCBM can be applied to develop simulation code for a wide range of WSN storage models, reducing the development effort. © 2017 ACM.},

	abstract = {The rising human population in urban environments drives the mission towards smart cities, which envisions a wide deployment of sensors in order to improve the quality of living. In this regard, opportunistic networks (OppNets) present an economical means of collecting delay tolerant data from sensors to their respective gateways for providing various Smart City services. Due to the distributed nature of the network, encounter-based routing protocols achieve acceptable throughput by requiring nodes to exchange and update contact information on an encounter basis. Unfortunately, sufficient insight into the associated overhead is lacking in the literature. Hence, we contribute by modelling contact information overhead and investigating its impact on OppNet routing, particularly in terms of data exchange success and energy consumption on portable handheld devices. Our findings reveal that the expected contact information overhead in Smart City scenarios significantly reduces data exchange success and increases energy consumption on portable handheld devices, thereby threatening the feasibility of the technology. We address this issue by proposing an algorithm that can be incorporated into encounter-based routing protocols to reduce contact information overhead without compromising throughput. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm reduces the average contact information overhead, increases throughput and reduces average energy consumption. © 2017 by the authors.},

Using buses to move sensors allows each node to cover a wider area, at a negligible cost. SensingBus is based on a three-level architecture. At the first level, sensing nodes collect and send data to the second level, consisting of fog nodes. The fog nodes pre-process and deliver data to the third level, the cloud infrastructure, which stores and makes data externally available. The fog infrastructure, on the other hand, discards defective data, compresses information, and provides secure access points between fog and cloud. To validate SensingBus, we build a prototype and perform experiments to stress the fog nodes. We verify that each one can accommodate at least 20 simultaneous sensing nodes, an adequate number to sense a city such as Rio de Janeiro. © 2014 IEEE.},

When some monitoring systems based on wireless sensor networks are deployed, sensing and transmission configurations of sensor nodes may be adjusted exploiting the relevance of the considered events, but efficient detection and classification of events of interest may be hard to achieve. In Smart City environments, several people spontaneously post information in social media about some event that is being observed and such information may be mined and processed for detection and classification of critical events. This article proposes an integrated approach to detect and classify events of interest posted in social media, notably in Twitter, and the assignment of sensing priorities to source nodes.

	abstract = {The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices demands robust structures for processing and storing trillion gigabytes of data. Part of those data can be used for evaluating the solution's effectiveness and to improve it. Hence, a reliability analysis based on the solution's produced data is important to validate it and find weaknesses to solve. Therefore, in this paper we process the data generated by a sensor-based smart parking system to present a reliability analysis. This system is implemented placing ultrasonic sensors, a web service, the FIWARE platform, and a mobile application to Android devices, in a three-layer architecture. We evaluate how many errors occur in a certain time window, the success and error rates and the most common kind of error produced. Finally, we conclude that even with some instability our sensing approach is effective with a worst case success rate greater than 96%. Moreover, we find out that our system works in an open environment with tropical climate conditions. © 2017 IEEE.},

	abstract = {As cities are becoming green and smart, public information systems are being revamped to adopt digital technologies. There are several sources (official or not) that can provide information related to a city. The availability of multiple sources enables the design of advanced analyses for offering valuable services to both citizens and municipalities. However, such analyses would fail if the considered data were affected by errors and uncertainties: Data Quality is one of the main requirements for the successful exploitation of the available information. This paper highlights the importance of the Data Quality evaluation in the context of geographical data sources. Moreover, we describe how the Entity Matching task can provide additional information to refine the quality assessment and, consequently, obtain a better evaluation of the reliability data sources.

	abstract = {Large cities around the world face numerous challenges to guarantee the quality of life of its citizens. A promising approach to cope with these problems is the concept of Smart Cities, of which the main idea is the use of Information and Communication Technologies to improve city services. Being able to simulate the execution of Smart Cities scenarios would be extremely beneficial for the advancement of the field. Such a simulator, like many others, would need to represent a large number of various agents (e.g. cars, hospitals, and gas pipelines). One possible approach for doing this in a computer system is to use the actor model as a programming paradigm so that each agent corresponds to an actor. The Erlang programming language is based on the actor model and is the most commonly used implementation of it. In this paper, we present the first version of InterSCSimulator, an open-source, extensible, large-scale Traffic Simulator for Smart Cities developed in Erlang, capable of simulating millions of agents using a real map of a large city. Future versions will be extended to address other Smart City domains. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

	abstract = {Purpose: The development of smart cities (SCs) is a costly process as it requires the implementation of physical infrastructure to meet the demand for data collection. On the other hand, there are open government data (OGD) that are open and free, and can be a first step from the current city evolution to SCs at a more affordable cost. However, these data are available in a decentralized way, in different formats and granularities. To date, the authors have not found any literature work that performs the centralization of OGDs on a single platform. The purpose of this paper is provide a centralized OGD platform. Design/methodology/approach: This work investigates the state-of-the-art literature from the OGD, establishes the research question, design and develop the platform for OGD and accomplish the validation of the platform. Findings: Through the validations of the platform, advantages were observed in relation to productivity gain for the development of solutions, in the SC context, using the proposed platform. Research limitations/implications: The data have been collected in a manual way but for future works, the authors will use the web-crawler for the collection of data. Practical implications: One town hall (Sorocaba) is interested in using the platform to analyze the data usage in the simple way and compare with the other nearby towns. Originality/value: It is a recent work in literature using OGD, and there is no work that centralizes the information about several town halls to provide comparison between them and improve the decision-making. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

While most of the related works choose to focus on specific dimensions of the data, the proposed models aim to benefit from the extent of the information existing in social platforms. Thus, this paper explores the full potential of social media data and proposes novel clustering models for retrieving information about city dynamics and urban characterization by incorporating new dimensions to state of the art algorithms. Aspects such as venue rating, entropy and popularity may lead to new and more complete understanding of activities and trends in a city. Preliminary experiments show that it is possible to aggregate a large diversity of information from different social networks, and generate different and complementary visualizations of the city. Moreover, by applying these methods to urban environments, governments and citizens can better understand and build better sustainable cities together. © 2017 IEEE.},

Due to the population growing rate, new issues are still arising, but technology can be used to address such issues and improve life quality in big cities. In that scenario, surveillance is a highly desired service and most governments are already using different types of devices to provide high levels of security. Wireless Visual Sensor Networks (WVSN) can be used to monitor every part of a city without the cost of running cables all over it. However, there must be an efficient way to gather all information collected by the sensors and cameras, with reduced energy consumption and average latency. This work proposes a new algorithm to position multiple mobile sinks in WVSN deployed along roads and streets. A relevance-based approach was designed to position sinks closer to source nodes with higher sensing relevance, since they are expected to transmit more data packets. The proposed algorithm can detect forbidden and disconnected zones, making sure sinks will be positioned in permitted areas, which makes this approach very suitable for realistic smart city applications. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {In apartments, houses and hotels, showers are by far the biggest consumers of water, responding to about 25% of the total volume consumed every month. When winter hits big cities and temperatures fall, the hot water consumption increases dramatically. Since end users often dispense cold water present in the pipelines until the heated water from the reservoirs is perceived in showers or other points of use, hotels and residential buildings are responsible for a considerable waste of treated water. Several solutions based on local hardware have been proposed to partially overcome this problem, but many of them try to reduce the waste of water at the expense of reducing the efficiency of the heating and recirculating systems. The age of the IoT has brought to the smart buildings new perspectives regarding to rational use of resources, providing savings and real comfort for users. This work proposes a smart water heating scheme, mediated by IoT technology, for large buildings in urban settings. The main goal is ensuring the minimal waste of water as well as energy economy in pumping and heating systems. The proposed automated solution is built from an open-source Asterisk-based IP-PBX on cloud computing technology. A complete experimental setup considering a residential building in the southeastern region of Brazil is implemented and tested. The achieved benefits are tangible and significant when compared to the dedicated existing systems. © 2017 IEEE.},

This crime incident forecasting helps patrol supervisors to elaborate the list of predefined locations (points) and staying time at which each police vehicle must patrol. ROTA-Analytics supports multiple machine and statistical learning methods selection to create an environment of crime prediction in different areas of the city. All the phases from time series creation to the automatic machine selection are discussed and exemplified with real data from Natal City in Brazil.

	abstract = {Cities are the places where the greatest technological changes will take place during the next few decades. Some years from now, important investments will be destined towards elaborating and implementing urban solutions. However, people with sensorial disabilities will still have to overcome the problem of autonomy in urban areas. Autonomy presumes the existence of the right conditions for complete relocation towards the desired destination. This is closely related to the process of planning buildings, sidewalks and signaling, among others and it is supported by legal measures, promoting accessibility. However, several barriers and the lack of information in urban areas should be faced meanwhile. In this paper, the features of a travel aid previously designed, were enhanced based on the Internet of Things—IoT. This approach has a goal to better suit the device to the smart cities’ context. To this end, an architecture combining both haptic feedback (tactile and auditory), acquiring relevant information from the environment, was designed. Quantitative and quantitative assessments obtained from experimental tests shows satisfactory results. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Wien.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an experience applied to a public university campus using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to evaluate and improve the energy efficiency of the indoor spaces of the buildings within the limits of the Federal University of Piauí, considering the lighting (installed power and luminous flux) and air conditioning (absorbed electric power and cooling capacity) input/output variables. Using Brazilian energy efficiency evaluation methods, a comparison was made between DEA and Brazilian standards, with the goal of examining DEA's performance and feasibility in efficiency improvement. The results revealed that all of the analyzed university classrooms were inefficient, which is coherent with the classification obtained by applying Brazilian standards; the calculated efficiency scores for these rooms varied from 0.7182 to 0.8477, a 0.7848 average. The DEA model, while operating in lighting and air conditioning systems, achieved a reduction of installed power of 43.5% and 22.7%, respectively, totaling a decrease of 25.6%, being able to maintain the standard characteristics of the systems mentioned. According to the DEA models, it was found that the generated targets effectively improved the efficiency of lighting and air-conditioning systems, reducing excessive inputs such as air conditioners' consumption and increasing deficient outputs such as luminous flux. It is possible to expand this successful application in the layout of the building in the whole campus area to concept small smart city projects; both have been achieved in the public buildings of the administrative body. Results from this paper revealed DEA's potential in assessing and optimizing the energy efficiency of buildings, improving their sustainability indexes, acting as a tool to support decision-making and benchmarking. © 2017 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Opportunistic networks (OppNets) provide a scalable solution for collecting delay-tolerant data from sensors to their respective gateways. Portable handheld user devices contribute significantly to the scalability of OppNets since their number increases according to user population and they closely follow human movement patterns. Hence, OppNets for sensed data collection are characterised by high node population and degrees of spatial locality inherent to user movement. We study the impact of these characteristics on the performance of existing OppNet message replication techniques. Our findings reveal that the existing replication techniques are not specifically designed to cope with these characteristics. This raises concerns regarding excessive message transmission overhead and throughput degradations due to resource constraints and technological limitations associated with portable handheld user devices. Based on concepts derived from the study, we suggest design guidelines to augment existing message replication techniques. We also follow our design guidelines to propose a message replication technique, namely Locality Aware Replication (LARep). Simulation results show that LARep achieves better network performance under high node population and degrees of spatial locality as compared with existing techniques. © 2017 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Nowadays domestic and enterprise WLANs are pervasive and offer capabilities adequate for a broad spectrum of applications. Unlocking these networks for enhanced wireless access to select users and devices, through dynamically sharing the unused portion of hotspots bandwidth, is key to provide seamless connectivity. Far from providing just basic wireless connectivity, we argue that these WLANs can be efficiently exploited to cope with emerging applications in the context of smart cities, massive machine type communication, and cellular data offloading. We introduce an approach aimed at the efficient sharing of available WLANs resources, allowing applications of domestic or enterprise users to coexist with third-party applications. To achieve this goal, we go beyond existing solutions by proposing the virtualization of access networks to offer differentiated networking services in an isolated manner. However, commodity wireless access devices are low-cost and performance-constrained, in contrast to carrier-grade systems that are very costly by deploying high networking performance. For this paper, we focus on the suitability of our approach on the customer premises, by assessing key performance networking aspects of SDN-enabled commodity wireless access devices, to obtain a better perspective of their current limitations. © 2017 IEEE.},

In a Human Smart City, people rather than technology are the true actors of the urban "smartness". The urban transformation is driven by the citizens through their empowerment and motivation allowing major city challenges to be addressed, including sustainable behaviour transformations. The Human Smart Cities concept builds upon emergent sustainable models for urban living, working and governance, enabled by Open Platforms and Digital Services. At the core of the vision is the citizen-centric and participatory approach to the co-design, development, and production of smart city services. Such services exploit the technical "smartness" of sensors, meters and infrastructures in a context favouring citizen empowerment, social interaction in physical urban settings, public-citizens use of open data and data analytics and partnerships. The authors argue that the city challenges are more effectively addressed at the scale of neighbourhood and they provide cases and experiences that demonstrate the viability, importance and impact of this model in Europe and beyond.

	abstract = {Despite the existence of automatic systems for collecting information about events in the city, without information sharing by citizens, smart city services concepts can hardly success. Thus, the problem is not the existence of technology solutions for smart cities concepts, but how to develop services that will involve citizens to share information about the events in the city. Social psychology theories point out that sense of bellowing, perceived enjoyment, perceived reciprocal benefits, power of knowledge, outcome expectation and perceived status, provides an involvement for citizens to share information and knowledge. In this paper, we propose to relate those theories, with the intension to use a mobile augmented reality service. We created an online survey, based in a scenario with a video, where the participants visualize a character behavior sharing and getting information in the city, using a mobile augmented reality service. The results confirm that the participants accept and want to use a mobile augmented reality service in a smart city, and have been identify the factors that could be more associated with the intention to use the augmented reality technology in the smart city, namely perceived enjoyment, intention to share experience, intention to get knowledge, perceived value, perceived similarity and perceived reciprocal benefits. Exploring those constructs inside gamification solutions in this mobile augmented reality service, is discussed in the conclusion. © 2018, Crown.},

However, the implementation of this concept is hindered by its complexity and limitations in cities. Using a model that contains the basic concepts of a smart city ensures such basic concepts will be approached during specification, besides facilitating communication among designers and allowing the evolution of a smart city to be followed. The International Cartographic Association (ICA) has developed a formal model for Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) using the Enterprise, Information, and Computation viewpoints of the Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) framework. Assuming that an SDI and volunteered geographic data (VGI) are key parts of a smart city, this study adapts ICA's formal model for SDI with basic concepts that a smart city must have. The adapted model was applied in the specification of the Enterprise viewpoint of a system to reduce traffic congestion.

When employing visual sensors in that scenario, still images and video streams may be retrieved from monitored areas, potentially providing valuable data for many applications. Actually, visual sensor networks may need to be highly dynamic, reflecting the changing of parameters in smart cities. In this context, characteristics of visual sensors and conditions of the monitored environment, as well as the status of other concurrent monitoring systems, may affect how visual sensors collect, encode and transmit information. This paper proposes a fuzzy-based approach to dynamically configure the way visual sensors will operate concerning sensing, coding and transmission patterns, exploiting different types of reference parameters.

	abstract = {In Brazil, the government has historically given low attention to the planning of telecommunication infrastructure, such as the prediction of the Internet bandwidth in the short and medium term, since this process can be slow and costly. Notably, smart city applications are impaired by this policy, because they depend on cost-benefit technology to support the Internet of Things. This paper presents a method for forecasting the Internet demand based on public data obtained from the International Telecommunication Union, the World Bank, and government agencies, using Brazil as a case study. The information inputs are associated with the population growth, and with social and technological development. The prediction process uses statistic concepts and models to infer the relationship between input variables and the data bandwidth rate. The proposed methodology is not restricted to the prediction of the Internet demand and may also be used to estimate other concerns for developing countries, such as oil, energy, and water consumption. The method is compared with other time series analysis models. The results reveal that factors related to innovation and technology significantly impact the annual projection of the Internet demand. © 2013 IEEE.},

We collected and characterized more than 9M tweets from the two biggest cities in Brazil, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. We performed topic modeling using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to produce an unsupervised distribution of semantic topics over the stream of geo-located tweets as well as a distribution of words over those topics. We manually labeled and aggregated similar topics obtaining a total of 29 different topics across both cities. Results showed similarities in the majority of topics for both cities, reflecting similar interests and concerns among the population of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. Nevertheless, some specific topics are more predominant in one of the cities. © 2017 IEEE.},

All papers referenced in this work are presented as a solution to equip the blind people with devices and sensors (controlled by a computational system) with the ability to capture environmental structure data and somehow describe it to the understanding of the blind people. Our work explores another side of this problem: how the environment can transmit data about itself to safely-help guide blind orientation in this environment? In other words, from our view, the environment must report data on its structure as opposed to make the blind person try to extract these data from this environment. So, here we propose to use an intelligent semaphore system (traffic lights) to communicate with a mobile system carried by the blind person and by the coherent processing of the signals sent and received between the mobile device and the intelligent semaphore, to conduct the blind in the streets crossing the crosswalk safely. © 2016 IEEE.},

In this wide scenario, sensors are functionally described in their data-sensing role to be the next considered nodes interfacing to exchange data. Then routing aspects are considered along with data management, including aspects related to user applications as well. The description of the sensors and their interfaces will be treated on data sensing and transmission with the use of WSN-routing protocols. For the sensor-routing process, it will be considered with multihop data transfer between nodes and the end-to-end goal to meet the network quality of service (QoS). Furthermore, the management in WSN related with the user application data will be shown, and the authors will point to future expectations about IoT, highlighting the application of sensors in Smart Cities. © 2018 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {A new era of automated services has permeated user's daily lives thanks to paradigms such as Smart City and the Internet of Things. This shift from traditional applications is possible due to the massive amount of heterogeneous devices that constitute the Internet of Things. To provide newly improved characteristics to these services, such as mobility support, high resilience, and low latency, an extension to the Cloud computing paradigm was created, called Fog computing, which brings processing and storage resources towards the edge of the network, in the vicinity of the Internet of Things environment. This scenario implies a higher complexity level needed to coordinate available resources and how applications and services use them. Although some solutions have been proposed for the Cloud, several characteristics differentiate the Cloud from the Fog, creating the need for new mechanisms for the coordination of resources, applications, and services in the Fog. This paper explains the challenges present in the Fog that call for new mechanisms to later propose an architecture to manage resources in the Fog using a hybrid approach. In the Internet of Things and South-Bound Fog Levels, a distributed management of applications and services is proposed applying choreography techniques to enable automated fast decision making. A centralized approach to orchestrate applications and services taking advantage of a global knowledge of the resources available in the network is suggested for the North-Bound Fog and Cloud Levels. © 2017 IEEE.},

Despite the various advances in middleware technologies to support future smart cities, there are no universally accepted platforms yet. Most of the existing solutions do not provide the required flexibility to be shared across cities. Moreover, the extensive use and development of non-open-source software leads to interoperability issues and limits the collaboration among R&D groups. In this paper, we explore the use of a microservices architecture to address key practical challenges in smart city platforms. We present InterSCity, a microservice-based open source smart city platform that aims at supporting collaborative, novel smart city research, development, and deployment initiatives. We discuss how the microservice approach enables a flexible, extensible, and loosely coupled architecture and present experimental results demonstrating the scalability of the proposed platform. © 2017 by SCITEPRESS Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Simple tasks become a challenge for visually impaired individuals either because of the difficulty getting reliable non-visual information from the surrounding space or the lack of information. In Smart Cities scenarios, important investments will be directed to urban accessibility, but nowadays people with sensory disabilities still have to face mobility problems in those spaces. Therefore, designing suitable solutions to provide more information about urban spaces is extremely important and requires user participation. This context motivated the development of the Electronic Long Cane project. The project enhances the features of traditional long canes to detect obstacles located above the waist. Nowadays, the electronic cane was redesigned including new functions based on the Internet of Things. As a result, evidences of User-Centric Design have emerged, increasing the probability of success of this technology in Smart Cities context. © 2017 by IGI Global. All rights reserved.},

Such applications focus in recognizing human activities in order to perform different tasks allowing the opportunity to support people in their different scenarios. In this paper we propose a deep neural architecture for kitchen human action recognition. This architecture contains an ensemble of convolutional neural networks connected through different fusion methods to predict the label of each action. Experiments show that our architecture achieves the novel state-of-the-art for identifying cooking actions in a well-known kitchen dataset. © 2017 IEEE.},

These initiatives became an attempt to crowdsource the development of software applications targeting government transparency and urban life, under the smart cities umbrella. Some authors have been criticizing the results of these competitions, complaining about the usefulness and quality of the software that is produced. However, academic literature has much anecdotal evidence on that, being scarce on empirical analysis of civic hackathons. Therefore, we intended to gather preliminary data not only to help verifying those claims but also to understand how teams in these competitions are tackling the different activities in their software development process, from requirements to application release and maintenance. In this work, we present preliminary results of these findings. © 2017 IEEE.},

The multiple case studies focus on three cities in Brazil that run municipal operations centers in an effort to “become smarter”: Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, and Belo Horizonte. Interviews with directors, managers, and technicians shed light on the contribution that ICT makes in promoting an environment of collaboration in the government.

The implementation for effective smart building requires deep study of information systems, monitoring objectives with the data collection and analysis and reflection on concepts, representation, goals and occupations of buildings. This research is focused on the application of technologies within the domain of Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC). The objective is to identify the stage of current literature on the topics Information Modeling, Information Retrieval and Internet of Things (IoT) in buildings. It is also to discuss concepts and advances Smart Building, Building Automation, Intelligent Building and Information Modeling Building (BIM). Finally, it is proposed for the implementation of IoT in a research laboratory of UFMG. For this, the bibliographic research method was used in the main multidisciplinary databases and complete bases of the Information Science area, which proves the complementarity and interconnection between the concepts. The smart lab experiment is a proof of concept proposal that through practice makes simulations for real solutions like validation. The results demonstrate that the implementation of IoT provides new insights into the behavior of people and the environment, supporting the identification of standards and setting precedents for optimization. © 2018 International Institute of Informatics and Systemics IIIS.

	abstract = {The current Internet design falls short in scenarios characterized by intermittent connectivity and absence of supporting infrastructure. Pocket switched networking allows communication between portable handheld user devices in such environments through the store-carry-forward paradigm. This involves storing data in device memory, exploiting user movement to physically transport the data, and forwarding through available short-range wireless interfaces. In this regard, user devices can be leveraged as data mules for point-to-point communication in two main scenarios: (i) conveying data between major infrastructures in urban areas (e.g., transporting sensor data to gateways in smart cities); and (ii) extending wireless coverage to provide connectivity in developing regions (e.g., bridging user devices and remote Internet access points). User movement in such scenarios exhibit spatial locality, which is the preference to a geographical location than others. This feature influences the data transfer opportunities that exist between different sets of users. This paper investigates the impact of locality on routing in pocket switched networks by: (i) evaluating the performance of existing routing strategies for point-to-point communication over different degrees of locality; and (ii) providing insights towards enhancing routing performance for realizing the aforementioned application scenarios through locality awareness. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The advent of future 5th Generation (5G) use cases, such as ultra-dense networking and ultra-low latency propelled by Smart Cities and IoT projects will demand revolutionary network infrastructures. The need for low latency, high bandwidth, scalability, ubiquitous access and support for IoT resource-constrained devices are some of the prominent issues that networks have to face to support future 5G use cases, which arise since current wireless and mobile infrastructures are not able to fulfill. In particular, the pervasiveness and high-density of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) at urban centers, together with their growing capacity and evolving standards, can be leveraged to support such demand. We argue that the integration of key 5G cornerstone technologies, such as Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and softwarization, fill some of the abovementioned gaps in regards to proper WLAN management and service orchestration. In this paper, we present a solution for slicing WLAN infrastructures, aiming to provide differentiated services on top of the same substrate through customized, isolated and independent digital building blocks. Through this proposal, we aim at efficiently handling ultra-dense networking 5G use cases to achieve benefits at unprecedented levels. Towards this goal, we present proof of concept realised over a real testbed and assess its feasibility. © 2017 IEEE.},

In Layer-1, we apply novel Big Data techniques to compute bus travel time and passenger demands in an efficient and economical way. Layer-2 contains two analytic components: network analysis of passenger transit patterns and causal relationship analysis for bus delays. The third layer provides decision support in an interactive visualization environment. The proposed system is developed and validated in cooperation with the city of Fortaleza in Brazil. The use of generally available urban transportation data makes our methodology adaptable and customizable for other cities. © 2016 IEEE.},

A wide variety of devices, from smart phones to dedicated sensors, have the capability of collecting and streaming data at unprecedented rates. Typical applications include smart cities & built environments for instance, where sensor-based infrastructures continue to increase in scale and variety. Analysis of stream data involves: (i) execution of a number of operations on a time/sample window - e.g. min./max./avg., filtering, etc; (ii) a need to combine a number of such operations together; (iii) eventdriven execution of operations, generally over short time durations; (iv) operation correlations across multiple data streams. The use of such operations does not fit well in the per-hour or per-minute cloud billing models currently available from cloud providers - with some notable exceptions (e.g. Amazon AWS). In this paper we discuss how microbilling and sub-second resource allocation can be used in the context of streaming applications and how micro-billing models bring challenges to capacity management on cloud infrastructures.

	abstract = {According to UNESCO, education is a fundamental human right and every nation’s citizens should be granted universal access with equal quality to it. Because this goal is yet to be achieved in most countries, in particular in the developing and underdeveloped countries, it is extremely important to find more effective ways to improve education. This paper presents a model based on the application of computational intelligence (data mining and data science) that leads to the development of the student’s knowledge profile and that can help educators in their decision making for best orienting their students. This model also tries to establish key performance indicators to monitor objectives’ achievement within individual strategic planning assembled for each student. The model uses random forest for classification and prediction, graph description for data structure visualization and recommendation systems to present relevant information to stakeholders. The results presented were built based on the real dataset obtained from a Brazilian private k-9 (elementary school). The obtained results include correlations among key data, a model to predict student performance and recommendations that were generated for the stakeholders. © 2018 by the authors.

An important factor for the process of opening courses is the region economic factor. Considering the regional labor market for such planning can bring benefits and interconnecting these elements transforms cities into smart cities. However, although there are several big data sources that provide this information, there is still an individualistic data view. Therefore, this work proposes to interconnect these factors with the multilayer social networks resources to support the decisions of higher education and their relations with the professional demands. To do so, an experiment is carried out to relate data from higher education offerings and employment/unemployment rates, creating a multilayer graph from these unstructured data. Our contribution is the investigation on how non-structured data can be analyzed in a multilayer perspective for this domain and how to assign proportional weights to the nodes in order to generate weighted graphs. © 2018 CEUR-WS.

This feature has found different applications, in particular in the Smart Cities area, in order to establish dynamic communications between the citizens and the city government. This category of application is nestled into the Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) application group, due to their final purpose of sharing sensing data to an open platform that includes a huge number of people. This paper presents an extension of the general-purpose ParticipAct platform, a MCS application developed by the University of Bologna, focused on the needs of people with impaired mobility. The goal is specializing ParticipAct to enable a crowdsourcing platform that guarantees a solid support for their lifetime allowing reviewing and sharing opinions regarding public and private places and architectonic barriers of a city area. Showed results confirm the effectiveness of the developed application in terms of both its viability via integration with existing and widely diffused Geographical Information Systems (GIS), and its feasibility in terms of system and user-perceived performances. © 2016 IEEE.},

In this paper, we evaluate the utilization of mobile sensors as a possible approach to cover wider areas with fewer sensors and to use opportunistic communication to solve connectivity issues. In this direction, we propose a mobile sensor network using the public transportation system. To validate the feasibility of our proposal, we start by evaluating the performance of important commercial sensors in a mobile scenario, comparing measurements of static and mobile sensors of temperature, humidity, barometric pressure and luminosity. Our findings suggest that there is no or neglectful speed dependency on the measurements taken. © 2016 IEEE.},

This research takes up this challenge by storing and compiling data from different sensors, and by carrying out an exploratory analysis of the information gathered. In this research, sensors that collect data from a specific Sao Paulo's Metropolitan Area (SMA) have been analysed. These sensors are capable of measuring carbon monoxide (CO) levels. This research aims to analyse the main architectures for both batch and stream sensor processing and to use one of them for the construction of a Big Data environment. Big Data tools were used for IoT storage, processing and visualization data. During the experiments, carbon monoxide sensors (MQ7), were analysed. They were connected through a microcontroller unit that supports the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). This project highlights the necessary tools to execute and analyse the data in a dynamic manner. The data collected by the sensors show that the avarage levels of carbon monoxide are well above the international standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO). © 2017 IEEE},

	abstract = {Smart control access to any service is at the very basis of any smart city project. Biometrics have been used as a solution for system access control, for many years now. However, the simple use of biometrics can not be considered as final and perfect solution. Most problems are related to the data transmission way between the medias, where the users require access and the servers where the biometric data, captured upon registration, are stored. In this paper, the use smart-cards is adopted as a possible effective yet efficient solution to this problem. Palm-prints have been used as a human identifier for a long time now. This biometric is considered one of the most reliable to distinguish a person from another as its unique yet stable over time. In this work, we propose an efficient implementation of palm-print verification on smart-cards. For this implementation, the matching is done on-card. Thus, the biometric characteristics are always kept in the owner’s card, guaranteeing the maximum security and privacy. In a first approach, the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) are improved using upward, downward, leftward and rightward translations of the matched palm-codes. However, after thorough analysis of the achieved results, we show that the proposed method introduces a significant increase in terms of execution time of the matching operation. In order to mitigate this impact, we augmented the proposed technique with an acceptance threshold verification, thus decreasing drastically the execution time of the matching operation, and yet achieving considerably low FAR and FRR. It is noteworthy to point out that these characteristics are at the basis of any access control successful usage. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

A challenge in this scenario is the transmission of sensed data in situations where the networking infrastructure is intermittent or unavailable. This paper outlines our research into an engine that uses opportunistic networks to support the data transmission of urban sensing applications. It applies situation awareness and computational intelligence approaches to perform routing, adaptation, and decision-making procedures.

	abstract = {As a result of rural and suburban migration to the cities, urban life has become a significant challenge for citizens and, particularly, for city administrators who must manage the sustainable use of resources such as energy, water, and transportation. Smart cities are the biggest vision to efficiently address these challenges through a real-time monitoring, providing an intelligent planning and a sustainable urban development. However, to accomplish them we need a tightly integration among citizens, city devices, city administrators, and the data center platform where all data is stored, combined, and processed. In this context, we propose ElCity, a model that combines citizens and city devices data to enable an elastic multilevel management of energy consumption for a particular city. As design decision, this management must occur automatically without affecting the quality of already offered services. The main contribution of ElCity model concerns the exploration of the cloud elasticity concept in multiple target levels (smartphones from citizens, city devices involved in the public lightning, and data center nodes), turning on or off the resources on each level in accordance with their demands. In this way, this article presents the ElCity architecture, detailing its modules distributed along the three data sources, in addition to an experiment that uses city devices and citizens data from Rome to explore energy saving. The results are promising, with an Energy Monitor module that allows the estimation of the energy consumption of elastic applications based on CPU and memory traces with an average and median precision of 97.15 and 97.72 percent. Moreover, we proposed a reduction of more than 90 percent in the energy spent in public lightning in the city of Rome which was obtained thanks to an analysis of geolocation data from their citizens. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The recently coined Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm leverages a large volume of heterogeneous Network Elements (NEs) demanding broad connectivity anywhere, anytime and anyhow, fueling the deployment of innovative Internet services, such as Cloud or Fog Computing, Data Center Networks (DCNs), Smart Cities or Smart Transportation. The proper deployment of these novel Internet services is imposing hard connectivity constraints, such as high transmission capacity, reliable communications, as well as an efficient control scheme capable of enabling an agile coordination of actions in large heterogeneous scenarios. In recent years, novel control schemes, such as the so-called Path Computation Element (PCE) has gained momentum in the network research community turning into real PCE implementations. Indeed, there is a wealth of studies assessing the PCE performance, clearly showing the potential benefits of decoupling routing control tasks from the forwarding nodes. Nevertheless, recognized the need for a control solution in IoT scenarios, there is not much published information analyzing PCE benefits in these IoT scenarios. In this paper, we distill how the PCE may gracefully provide for service composition in an agile manner, handling the specific constraints and requirements found in IoT scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel PCE strategy referred to as Service-Oriented PCE (SPCE), which enables network-aware service composition. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Modern cities are supported by many IT systems managed by distinct public and private agents. Such legacy systems are often incompatible since, in general, they use old, dependent and nonstandardised technologies. This results in an environment in which there is no interoperability among smart city systems, preventing richer and more interesting applications to be used by citizens, companies, and city administration. An alternative to solve the lack of interoperability is the adoption of a System-of- Systems (SoS) approach. A SoS is a set of independent and heterogeneous constituent systems that interoperate to accomplish a global mission. The collaboration among such constituent systems enables a SoS to offer new functionalities that cannot be provided by any of these systems working as individual entities. The goal of this paper is to propose SoS-centric middleware services to support the management and execution of SoS in Smart Cities environments in a dynamic, transparent and scalable way. The proposed services, once integrated into a smart city platform, support interoperability among different systems operating in a city. Moreover, this paper also presents a motivational case study to make it clear the issues that must be addressed when multiple independent systems are brought together to provide a new Smart City service or application. © 2016 Association for Computing Machinery.},

Currently, there is a gap in terms of understanding how context information is interrelated, as well as tracking which events occurred under which conditions within certain context scopes. Visualizing, specifying, tracking and monitoring typical contexts involved in IoT-based applications are still challenging activities since context modeling remains a low level process that requires much human expertise. In this paper we propose a new context life cycle that involves context design and context tracking. We developed a context-aware management framework, where contexts are modeled as graphs and can be explicitly designed and their occurrences can be tracked down. We believe that this feature of designing and tracking context graphs may help developers, administrators, and end-users in harnessing the wealth of information generated by highly scalable IoT systems. © 2017 IEEE.},

Increasing amounts of data are being continuously generated and monitored through widespread sensing technologies such as personal smartphones, large scale smart cities sensor deployments and smart electrical grids. However, the ability to aggregate and act upon such data gathered by sensors is still a significant research and industrial challenge. Devices that are able to collect and act on data at network edges are bounded by the amount of data that can be sent over networks. In this paper, we analyze the impact of workload distribution in a smart grid application, evaluating how we can increase processing rates by leveraging each time more powerful edge node processors. Our results show that our test bed application, leveraging cloud nodes processing and processing windows, is able to achieve processing rates of approximately 800k measurements per second using four edge node processors and a single cloud node. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.},

The Bitmap Disk Filtering (BitDF) is an scalable algorithm capable of handling large-scale datasets. Performance evaluation results shows that, when compared to the current state-of-the- art algorithm, BitDF can reduce 99% of the processing time while not affecting accuracy. We prove the efficiency of BitDF by performing evaluation with both real and synthetic large datasets.

In this paper, we present Selfie Cafe, an Urban Computing application for leveraging socialization. The application was deployed in the wild to see how people would react to it in specific places where socialization would be expected but was not happening. Results of the Selfie Cafe installation show that it helped setting a more playful mood in the place, an increase in the time spent by people in there as well as supporting interactions among locals, acquaintances and strangers.

	abstract = {Cities are facing major challenges and the expansion of citizen participation has been considered a valuable strategy. Citizen participation experiences supported by information and communication technologies (ICT), the so-called eParticipation, have taken hold in cities around the world. In this chapter, we discuss some of the enabling and inhibiting elements for the creation of virtual spaces for participation by governments in a developing country of Latin America—Brazil. A list of enabling and inhibiting elements grouped in five dimensions was produced from a survey with Brazilian experts, including public officials, academic researchers, and consultants involved with the implementation of eDemocracy projects. To contribute to smart city initiatives in developing countries, interviews were made with the chief information officers (CIOs) of four major cities in Brazil—Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre, Curitiba, and Campinas. We found out that the enablers are concentrated in the sociocultural and technological dimensions, while the inhibitors are mainly in the political and governance dimensions. The enabling elements are, for the most part, external to the sphere of action of city information and communication technologies (ICT) managers. As far as inhibiting elements are concerned, even though they pose broad challenges that may be perceived to be beyond the reach of the leaders of eParticipation initiatives, there is more scope for managerial action. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

	abstract = {As a result of rural and suburban migration to the cities, urban life has become a significant challenge for citizens and mayors, imposing a huge concern in the sustainable use of resources like energy, water, transportation and housing. Smart cities are the biggest bet to address these challenges efficiently through a real-time monitoring approach which aims to assist in intelligent planning and sustainable urban development. However, to accomplish this monitoring efficiently and to enable the sustainable use of resources, it is necessary an integration between citizens, city devices and the platform where the data is stored and processed. In this context, we are proposing the 3LES model (3 Levels of Energy Saving for Smart Cities), a model that combines data from citizens, city devices and nodes from the processing plataform to offer a multilevel energy saving proposal. 3LES must act transparently without affecting the quality of the services already offered in the city. This paper presents the components of management and monitoring of power consumption at various levels, as well as a model that monitors the energy consumption of elastic cloud applications. The results are promising, with a model that allows the estimation of the energy consumption of elastic applications based on CPU and memory traces with an average and median precision of 97.15% and 97.72%. In addition, we obtained a reduction of more than 90% in the energy spent in public lighting in the city of Rome when analyzing the citizens' location. © 2016 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The urban environment has a lot of devices that use different technologies, which makes the integration of data generated in them a difficult process due to their heterogeneity. However, it is important to manage these data in an integrated way, enabling the exchange of information between existing fields and assisting in the decision-making process. Moreover, there's no way to tell how this data will need to be processed since each application may require it to be available obeying specific processes. Thus, this paper describes the design and implementation of a platform that aims to integrate, process and make available data streams from heterogeneous sources. It also defines an extensible data processing flow, which makes the creation of new processes for existing data and the inclusion of new types of data easier. Finally, a case study was conducted, which used a parking lot as scenario and assessed some important aspects related to platform implementation. © 2015 ACM.},

To leverage digital information from each individual project into business value for the whole industry, researchers must borrow knowledge and solutions from computational fields, such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, Data Mining and Data Science. They will provide a guide to the development, and even transformation of current BIM processes, with potential for development of new tools and automation of many tasks. What is not entirely clear is if BIM could take advantage also from Big Data Analytics, as some professionals are been advocating. In this paper, the author analyzes Big Data problems and the BIM context, and argues that BIM could not immediately take advantage from Big Datainfrastructure. Nevertheless, a route of development is suggested, which extends BIM from its predominantly building-focused models to models that encompass an entire city, which certainly will demand Big Data Analytics. Thus, a new City Information Modeling seems to be the right path of development for BIM as it turns to be integrated with Geographic Information Systems and will lead to tools that would be adequate for future Smart Cities planning and management.},

	abstract = {Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) will play an important role in Smart Cities and will support the development of not only safety applications, but also car smart video surveillance services. Recent improvements in multimedia over VANETs allow drivers, passengers, and rescue teams to capture, share, and access on-road multimedia services. Vehicles can cooperate with each other to transmit live flows of traffic accidents or disasters and provide drivers, passengers, and rescue teams rich visual information about a monitored area. Since humans will watch the videos, their distribution must be done by considering the provided Quality of Experience (QoE) even in multi-hop, multi-path, and dynamic environments. This article introduces an application framework to handle this kind of services and a routing protocol, the DBD (Distributed Beaconless Dissemination), that enhances the dissemination of live video flows on multimedia highway VANETs. DBD uses a backbone-based approach to create and maintain persistent and high quality routes during the video delivery in opportunistic Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) scenarios. It also improves the performance of the IEEE 802.11p MAC layer, by solving the Spurious Forwarding (SF) problem, while increasing the packet delivery ratio and reducing the forwarding delay. Performance evaluation results show the benefits of DBD compared to existing works in forwarding videos over VANETs, where main objective and subjective QoE results are measured. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

In this sense, the use of mobility agents already available to provide mobility to traditional sensors can enable a preliminary instrumentation of cities more quickly and possibly at a lower cost. As proof of concept, we investigated the use of metropolitan bus equipped with sensors such as urban data collectors. We believe that this strategy can help overcoming many challenges of traditional approaches for instrumentation of cities, such as power supply, maintenance, operation, and protection of a large amount of static sensors. To assess the feasibility of sampling by collectors, we conducted experiments comparing averages using frequent readings vs averages using intermittent readings collected by sensors of a climatological micro station. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The unprecedented capabilities of monitoring and responding to stimuli in the physical world of wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSAN) enable these networks to provide the underpinning for several Smart City applications, such as structural health monitoring (SHM). In such applications, civil structures, endowed with wireless smart devices, are able to self-monitor and autonomously respond to situations using computational intelligence. This work presents a decentralized algorithm for detecting damage in structures by using a WSAN. As key characteristics, beyond presenting a fully decentralized (in-network) and collaborative approach for detecting damage in structures, our algorithm makes use of cooperative information fusion for calculating a damage coefficient. We conducted experiments for evaluating the algorithm in terms of its accuracy and efficient use of the constrained WSAN resources. We found that our collaborative and information fusion-based approach ensures the accuracy of our algorithm and that it can answer promptly to stimuli (1.091 s), triggering actuators. Moreover, for 100 nodes or less in the WSAN, the communication overhead of our algorithm is tolerable and the WSAN running our algorithm, operating system and protocols can last as long as 468 days. © 2015 IEEE.},

It is expected that vehicles equipped with a variety of sensors will play a determining role in Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) and Smart City applications. With the evolution of VANET services comes the need for solutions to increase the availability of content to users. To this end, we propose a Geo-Localized Origin-Destination-based Content Replication (GO-DCR) solution that relies on vehicles' origin and destination points to decide which of them are more appropriate to replicate content inside a region of interest. We compare GO-DCR with two existing solutions through extensive simulations. The results show that GO-DCR increases content availability and reduces the cost of delivery. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.

	abstract = {In recent years, there is a growing research interest in smart city applications based on opportunistic communications. The opportunistic networks in these scenarios are composed of disconnections, network partitions, high delay and strong influence of human mobility. To cope with these challenges, social-inspired approaches have been proposed considering the structure of networks and personal user features, however, limited studies have explored temporal variations of features and influence of exogenous variables, disregarding adaptive forwarding policies recommended for dynamic scenarios. In this paper, we address these challenges while investigating both, the temperature and the season calendar, as environmental features able to model the behavior of users' mobility and peer contacts. The results showed distinct social and spatiotemporal features characterized by thermal conditions able to affect the network performance. We also identified critical points of temperature able to provide early signals about the network changes. Finally, our results indicate that environmental data are crucial information towards the design of the next generation opportunistic mobile networks. © 2016 IEEE.},

Technological navigation aids for blind must provide accurate information about the environment and select the best path to reach a chosen destination. Urban barriers represent dangers for the blind users. The dynamism of smart cities promotes a constant change of these dangers and therefore a potentially “dangerous territory” for these users. Previous work demonstrated that redundant solutions in smart environments complemented by human computation could provide a reliable and trustful data source for a new generation of blind navigation systems. We propose and discuss a modular architecture, which interacts with environmental sensors to gather information and process the acquired data with advanced algorithms empowered by human computation. The gathered metadata should enable the creation of “happy maps” that are delivered to blind users through a previously developed navigation system. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

	abstract = {The developments in wireless sensor networks, mobile technology and cloud computing have been pushing forward the concept of intelligent or smart cities, and each day smarter infrastructures are being developed with the aim of enhancing the well-being of citizens. These advances in technology can provide considerable benefits for the diverse components of smart cities including smart health which can be seen as the facet of smart cities dedicated to healthcare. A considerable defy that stills requiring appropriate responses is the development of mechanisms to detect health issues in patients from the very beginning. In this work, we propose a novel solution for indoor patient monitoring for medical purposes. The output of our solution will consist of a report containing the patterns of room occupation by the patient inside her/his home during a certain period of time. This report will allow health care professionals to detect changes on the behavior of the patient that can be interpreted as early signs of any health related issue. The proposed solution was implemented in an Android smartphone and tested in a real scenario. To assess our solution, 400 measurements divided into 10 experiments were performed, reaching a total of 391 correct detections which corresponds to an average effectiveness of 97.75%. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Smart cities have become a reality around the world. They rely on wireless communication technologies, and they have provided many benefits to society, such as monitoring road traffic in real-time, giving continuous healthcare assistance to residents and managing the environment. This article revisits key interoperability questions in heterogeneous wireless networks for smart cities, and outlines a simple, modular architecture to deal with these complex issues. The architecture is composed by sensing, access network, Internet/cloud and application layers. Different features provided by the architecture, such as interoperability among technologies, low cost, reliability and security, have been evaluated through experiments and simulations under different scenarios. The QoS support and the seamless connectivity between pairs of heterogeneous technologies are proposed through a policy-based management (PBM) framework and MIH (Media Independent Handover). Moreover, an 802.11 mesh backbone composed of different types of mesh routers has been deployed for interconnecting the sensors and actuators to the Internet. Key results from experiments in the backbone are examined. They compare: (i) the performance of a single-path routing protocol (OLSR) with a multipath one (MP-OLSR); (ii) the monitoring delays from the proposed low cost sunspot/mesh and arduino/mesh gateways; and (iii) the authentication mechanisms employed. Significant results from simulations allow the analysis of the reliability on vehicular/mesh networks under jamming attacks by applying the OLSR and MP-OLSR routing protocols. Finally, this article provides an overview of open research questions. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Implementation of smart and adaptable public transportation is an important challenge in developing cities and newly industrialized economies where growth characteristics contribute to and can be impacted by factors like overcrowding and travel delays. In this paper, we focus on bus transportation, and present the design and implementation of a 3-layer web-based system for performance evaluation and decision support. This is part of a "Smart Cities"initiative, which is an international collaboration between academia and government. The first layer estimates fundamental indicators such as bus travel time and passenger demands by integrating heterogeneous data sources. A novel bus-stop network is then designed in the second layer, which enables the derivation of passenger patterns in public transit using network analysis. The third layer provides decision support by analyzing causal relationships between indicators. The proposed web-based system called SMARTBUS is being developed and validated with the city of Fortaleza in Brazil. We believe the use of generally available urban transportation data makes our methodology adaptable and customizable for other cities. © 2016 International World Wide Web Conference Committee (IW3C2).},

SoS refer to complex software-intensive systems, resulted from interoperability of independent constituent systems, performing new missions that could not be performed by any constituents working separately. For these critical systems, their quality is undoubtedly essential. However, in general, there is a lack of studies that discuss how quality has been addressed in such systems. The main contribution of this paper is to present an experience of establishing a quality model (i.e., a set of quality characteristics/attributes, subcharacteristics, and metrics) for SoS, in particular, for the crisis/emergent management domain. This quality model is based on ISO/IEC 25010 and it has also proved to be an important support to evaluate a system of this domain, however their construction must be performed with caution. Experience such as presented in this work could be repeated in other domains, contributing to improve the quality of a diversity of critical, complex SoS that are currently being built.

Although some existing efforts have already tackled some of the several MCS issues, to the best of our knowledge, active experiments addressing the challenging issue of the assignment of MCS data collection campaigns to users, namely, MCS scheduling, in a large-scale crowdsensing real-world experiment are still missing. This paper presents the ParticipAct platform and living lab, an ongoing crowdsensing experiment at University of Bologna that involves 300 students for one year. In particular, this article focus on ParticipAct intelligent MCS scheduling of future crowdsensing campaigns based on user mobility history and powered by NoSQL technologies for fast processing of the large amount of mobility traces in the ParticipAct backend.

Among this scenario, Smart Cities applications intended to offer ideas, services or content adding value to a city or community. Generally built based on maps, these applications provide a large amount of data. In this research, we aim to analyze data visualization in a map-based application, investigating zooming and panning functionalities from a diverse user perspective. The selected application is Colab.re, an online collaboration system which allows the users to report urban issues based on their location. The main idea is to observe if potential users could perform the needed gestures to navigate in the map, and understand the information received. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016.},

In general, existing solutions are not effective to provide protection and security against attacks sinkhole on IoT, and they also introduce high consumption of resources de memory, storage and processing. Further, they do not consider the impact of device mobility, which in essential in urban scenarios, like smart cities. This paper proposes an intrusion detection system, called INTI (Intrusion detection of SiNkhole attacks on 6LoWPAN for InterneT of ThIngs), to identify sinkhole attacks on the routing services in IoT. Moreover, INTI aims to mitigate adverse effects found in IDS that disturb its performance, like false positive and negative, as well as the high resource cost. The system combines watchdog, reputation and trust strategies for detection of attackers by analyzing the behavior of devices. Results show the INTI performance and its effectiveness in terms of attack detection rate, number of false positives and false negatives. © 2015 IEEE.},

Towards implementing the Smart City concept, the literature on city e-government proposes five models aiming to guide the implementation process. This paper describes a case study on e-government implementation and derived knowledge to assess the usefulness of the proposed implementation models. The results confirm the benefits and limitations of such models and propose a success factor approach representing a major paradigm shift to study and assist e-government implementation.

One key concern is that the number of vehicles continuously increases faster than the available infrastructure, as well as the traffic congestion is a difficult issue to deal with. Several solutions to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have been proposed to identify congestion and re-route the vehicles afterwards. In this direction, this work introduces SPARTAN, a fully distributed ITS solution, which notifies drivers about congested areas through Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication and employs a real-time decision making mechanism used to reroute vehicles to avoid the congested areas. Simulation results show the effectiveness of SPARTAN in calculating new routes and disseminating them to vehicles that approaching a congestion area. As a consequence, SPARTAN reduces the travel time and the congestion time in urban scenarios when compared to existing approaches. © 2016 IEEE.},

Therefore, ensuring the desired QoS is a great challenge for the cloud service provider. Moreover, it increases when we have large amount of data to be manipulated in this environment. Considering that, performance is an important requirement for most customers when they migrate their applications to the cloud. In this paper, we propose a model for measuring a Service Response Time estimated for different request types on large databases available in a cloud environment. This work allows the cloud service provider and its customers establish an appropriate SLA relative to performance expected of services available in the cloud. Finally, the model was evaluated in Amazon EC2 cloud infrastructure and the TPC-DS like benchmark was used for generating a database of structured data, considering that some cloud computing platforms support SQL queries directly or indirectly. This makes the proposed solution relevant for these kind of problems. © 2015 IEEE.},

	abstract = {The industrial development and Brazilian economic context led to important structural changes, among others, the increase of population migration (rural to urban spaces), number of private vehicles (due to tax reduction and state subsidies for new cars and fuel), among others. Such changes impact not only the urban mobility at big cities but also the urban life quality, which is directly affected by pollutant emissions and noise. In order to limit emission impacts on sensitive population (children, elderly people, for example), city managers can enforce bounds on emissions and noise pollution generated by the city traffic in specific regions defined by geographical boundaries. This paper aims to contribute to the challenge of managing urban noise by exploring and analyzing the data with a geofencing approach. In particular, we present a exploratory data analysis toward a case study in Curitiba (1,800,000 inhabitants, a southern Brazilian city) aiming at analyzing possible sources of noise based on a particular data set of noise measurements, geographical information data, traffic, transportation and city licensing data. © Copyright 2016 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

	abstract = {Due to the problems caused by population growth in large cities, there is a need for solutions that point to the initiative of Smart Cities, that is, using the technology to offer resources that can help solve or minimize urban problems. This solutions seeks the integration of several sources of Information Technology(ICTs), however, those source of Information Technology form complex structures and generate a large volume of data, that represents big challenges and opportunities, impeding the possibility of to make available, systems that integrate informations of sensors and capture data from the physical space, getting samples of what is going on in the city in real time. With the intention of offer a reference architecture, to compare issues related with those challenges and opportunities, this paper presents an approach that employs components off-the-shelves for the construction of a crowdsensing platform for solution in Smart Cities. We performed an experiment to determine the performance and stability of the system. Thus, this proposal opens the way for to broaden the integration of data sources of various types of sensors and devices. © SBC 2015.},

On the other hand, smart cities today comprise a multidisciplinary challenge, where they have the objective of sustainable development and improving the quality of life of its inhabitants. Thus, we see in crowdsourcing a resource capable of contributing to building smart cities. This paper investigates the existing intersection between the fields of smart cities and crowdsourcing and discover the gaps and challenges that characterize this applications context. As a result, we propose some strategies to facilitate the development of crowdsourcing applications. These strategies are then applied to the construction of several applications of this type, two of which are discussed at the end of the article.},

	abstract = {With the advent of the social web, users contribute actively sharing their content instead of just navigate the Web. Such users have become truly human sensors through collaborative platforms such as the LBSNs (Location-Based Social Networks), bringing a collective intelligence for problems solving. Human sensors are in charge of producing VGI (Volunteered Geographic Information) and AGI (Ambient Geographic Information), very useful information in the most diverse application domains, such as the Smart Cities. These sensors assist on solving various problems of urban areas and contributing to the citizens' life quality improvement. Currently, the growing number of diseases cases transmitted by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, such as Dengue, Zika and Chikungunya, has led both Brazil and other countries to an alert state. The most efficient combating method nowadays relies on the population taking preventive actions, posing a challenge to the local authorities. In this context, this paper presents the DeuZikaChico, a framework that makes use of GIS technologies, mobile platforms, crowdsourcing and social networking, with the purpose of providing public managers better monitoring of epidemics with the support from the society.},
