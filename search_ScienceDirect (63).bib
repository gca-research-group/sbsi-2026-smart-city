abstract = {When designing smart cities’ building blocks, mobility data plays a fundamental role in applications and services. However, mobility data usually comes with unrestricted location of its corresponding entities (e.g., citizens and vehicles) and poses privacy concerns, among them recovering the identity of those entities with linking attacks. Location Privacy Protection Mechanisms (LPPMs) based on anonymization, such as mix-zones, have been proposed to address the privacy of users’ identity. Once the data is protected, a comprehensive discussion about the trade-off between privacy and utility happens. However, issues still arise about the application of anonymized data to smart city development: what are the smart cities applications and services that can best leverage mobility data anonymized by mix-zones? To answer this question, we propose the Utility Analysis Framework of Anonymized Trajectories for Smart Cities-Application Domains (UAFAT). This characterization framework measures the utility through twelve metrics related to privacy, mobility, and social, including mix-zones performance metrics from anonymized trajectories produced by mix-zones. This framework aims to identify applications and services where the anonymized data will provide more or less utility in various aspects. The results evaluated with cabs and privacy cars datasets showed that further characterizing it by distortion level, UAFAT ranked the smart cities application domains that best leverage mobility data anonymized by mix-zones. Also, it identified which one of the four case studies of smart city applications had more utility. Additionally, different datasets present different behaviors in terms of utility. These insights can contribute significantly to the utility of both open and private data markets for smart cities.}

abstract = {Smart cities have become a reality around the world. They rely on wireless communication technologies, and they have provided many benefits to society, such as monitoring road traffic in real-time, giving continuous healthcare assistance to residents and managing the environment. This article revisits key interoperability questions in heterogeneous wireless networks for smart cities, and outlines a simple, modular architecture to deal with these complex issues. The architecture is composed by sensing, access network, Internet/cloud and application layers. Different features provided by the architecture, such as interoperability among technologies, low cost, reliability and security, have been evaluated through experiments and simulations under different scenarios. The QoS support and the seamless connectivity between pairs of heterogeneous technologies are proposed through a policy-based management (PBM) framework and MIH (Media Independent Handover). Moreover, an 802.11 mesh backbone composed of different types of mesh routers has been deployed for interconnecting the sensors and actuators to the Internet. Key results from experiments in the backbone are examined. They compare: (i) the performance of a single-path routing protocol (OLSR) with a multipath one (MP-OLSR); (ii) the monitoring delays from the proposed low cost sunspot/mesh and arduino/mesh gateways; and (iii) the authentication mechanisms employed. Significant results from simulations allow the analysis of the reliability on vehicular/mesh networks under jamming attacks by applying the OLSR and MP-OLSR routing protocols. Finally, this article provides an overview of open research questions.}

This need becomes even more important and less obvious to supply when these data have discrepant events (i.e., outliers). Here we propose a method to explore the multiway nature of urban spaces data in outliers detection which includes three stages: (i) dimensionality reduction, where we model data as a 3rd-order tensor; from this reduction, we extract a set of latent factors to obtain the best fit for the next classification step; (ii) classification of latent factors, where the latent factors from the stage (i) are used to generate instances of similar events in monitoring smart urban spaces which result in high-quality clusters from the factorization; and (iii) combining steps (i) and (ii) to generate a refined urban space pattern identification model. We analyzed a real large-scale dataset with valuable data captured and streamed by urban sensors from 4 cities: Elda and Rois (Spain), Nuremberg (Germany), and Tallinn (Estonia). Our results allow us to conclude there is a kind of cyclic time patterns of urban sensing.}

As urban populations shift over time, predicting the changes to accessibility demand for certain services becomes crucial for responsible and ‘smart’ urban planning and infrastructure investment. In this study, we investigate how projected population change could affect accessibility to essential services in the City of Surrey, one of the fastest growing cities in Canada. Our objectives are two-fold: first, to quantify the additional pressure that Surrey's growing population will have on existing facilities; second, to investigate how changes in the spatial distribution of different age and income groups will impact accessibility equity across the city. We evaluated accessibility levels to healthcare facilities and schools across Surrey's multimodal transport network using origin-destination matrices, and combined this information with high-resolution longitudinal census data. Paying close attention to two vulnerable population groups – children and youth (0–19 years of age) and seniors (65+ years of age) – we analyzed shifts in accessibility demand from 2016 to 2022. The results show that population growth both within and outside the catchments of existing facilities will have varying implications for future accessibility demand in different areas of the city. By 2022, the city's hospitals and walk-in clinics will be accessible to ~9000 and ~124,000 more people (respectively) within a predefined threshold of 30 min by public transport. Schools will also face increased demand, as ~8000 additional children/youth in 2022 will move to areas with access to at least half of the city's schools. Conversely, over 27,000 more people – almost half of them seniors – will not be able to access a hospital in under 30 min by 2022. Since low-income and senior residents moving into poorly connected areas tend to be more reliant on public transport, accessibility equity may decline in some rural communities. Our study highlights how open-source data and code can be leveraged to conduct in-depth analysis of accessibility demand across a city, which is key for ensuring inclusive and ‘smart’ urban investment strategies.}

The IoT-cloudification scales up data centers to a high computational resource capacity, to suit the requirements of a large number of users wanting to access multiple services offered by revolutionary IoT applications which, in turn, consume huge amounts of data produced by billions of things. In such systems, IoT-tailored cloud services (e.g., software platforms and middleware) are responsible for running latency-critical IoT applications in different areas (e.g., healthcare, transport systems, safety, Smart Cities, and many others). These applications expect to produce high-density multimedia flows that must be handled appropriately by the underlying communication infrastructure to obtain transport services of the highest standard. In this work, we propose a novel control plane optimization, which leverages the support of the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) substrate so that it can advance beyond today’s IP-based communication systems, which reveals weaknesses (e.g. a limited performance and scalability) in delivering multimedia content through per-flow channels. An attempt is made to overcome these limitations by proposing CLASSICO, a Cross-LAyer Sdn SessIon COntrol approach that exploits the SDN substrate to offload the flow streaming network-computing task from the IoT cloud platform to selected SDN branching nodes, and hence ensures high timeliness and scalability for the IoT-cloud system as a whole. To achieve this, CLASSICO dynamically builds application-layer sessions, which comprise multiple participant members sharing same interested content, and connects them into optimal multiuser tree structures, whereby only selected branching nodes apply SDN replication function for quality-enhanced transport service. We applied CLASSICO to a multimedia use case, and the results show that it outperforms multicast-capable IoT systems in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) video assessment metrics.}

abstract = {A Smart City can be defined as a high-tech city with several public and private services capable to strategically solve (or mitigate) problems normally generated by rapid urbanization. Different models of indicators have been developed to follow cities’ evolution to become a Smart City. An example of such model is the standard 37120 from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that proposes a set of dimensions and indicators (e.g. Transportation, Recreation, Solid Waste) for services and quality of life for sustainable cities and communities. It has been common to find official social network profiles of organizations and governmental entities related to the services they provide or are responsible for (water, waste, transportation, cultural events, etc.) and that are used by citizens as a gateway to directly interact and communicate their complains and problems about those services. The present paper proposes to apply machine learning algorithms over the urban data generated by social networks in order to create classifiers to automatically categorize citizens messages according to the different cities services dimensions. For that, two distinct text datasets in Portuguese were collected from two social networks: Twitter (1,950 tweets) and Colab.re (65,066 posts). The texts were mapped according to the different ISO 37120 categories, preprocessed and mined through the use of 8 algorithms implemented in Scikit-Learn. Initial results pointed out the feasibility of the proposal with models achieving average F1-measures around 55% for F1-macro and 78% for F1-micro when using Linear Vector Classification, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Complement Naive Bayes. However, as the datasets were highly unbalanced, the performances of the models vary significantly for each ISO category, with the best results occurring for Wastewater, Water & Sanitation, Energy and Transportation. The classifiers generated here can be integrated on a number of different city services and systems such as: governmental support decision systems, customer complain systems, communities dashboards, police offices, transportation’s companies, cultural producers, environmental agencies, and recyclers’ companies.}

However, the wireless communication is susceptible to noise and interference, which results in loss of information in the routes from the sensors to the data aggregators. In addition, the devices used in these networks have restrictions on their processing, storage, and communication capacity, which diminishes, even more, the reliability of the data delivery. Therefore, this work describes a new communication method named μNet, which aims to increase the delivery rate of packets in multi-hop WSN. Such approach is based on peer-to-peer control messages to ensure that the packet has been properly forwarded. Besides that, the μNet is designed to be compatible with constrained devices, reducing the size of headers of the protocols and the size of the network buffer. By comparing μNet with widely used WSN protocols, it is demonstrated that this approach results in better end-to-end reliability in networks susceptible to interference.}

abstract = {Smart cities and healthcare services have been gaining much attention in recent years, as the benefits offered by this field of research are significant and improve quality of life. Systems can proactively detect health problems by monitoring a person’s vital signs and make automated decisions to prevent these problems from worsening. With this in mind, we highlight two essential requirements that smart city architectures should consider to achieve elevated quality of experience in the healthcare domain. The first is to process high-priority vital signs with short response times, so people with comorbidities can have health problems identified as soon as possible. The second is to employ scalability techniques to deal with high usage peaks resulting from people concentrating in specific city neighborhoods. This paper contributes to this field of research by proposing SmartVSO - a computational model of a hierarchic, scalable, tree-based, fog-cloud architecture that executes healthcare services with reduced response time for urgent vital signs. Fog computing is employed to reduce response times, and cloud computing is used to provide virtually infinite computing resources. Serverless computing is the main technology we consider for deploying and running healthcare services because this allows authorized companies to implement their own services in a distributed and pluggable approach, without recompiling the proposed modules and reducing scalability concerns for engineers. An experiment with 80,000 vital signs indicates that our solution processes 60% of the very critical ones in no more than 5.3 s, while an architecture without fog computing and without prioritization takes up to 231 min (around 3 h and 51 min) to process 60% of very critical vital signs.}

However, it appears that the approach to the role of the citizen in the promotion of intelligence is neglected, leaving questions about the role of the citizen in Smart Cities. Thus, the present study aimed to identify the technological structures applied in Smart Healthcare, allowing us to identify the role of the citizen in the promotion of smarter health services. A systematic literature review was carried out using the Methodi Ordinatio, resulting in a portfolio composed of 26 articles with scientific relevance. From the content analysis, four main approaches were identified, as well as technologies and methods to address one of the biggest challenges of health technologies: data security and privacy. From this, the role of the citizen in the Smart Healthcare was evidenced, aiming to contribute to the planning of projects and the development of future research to consider with more attention the participation of citizens.}

Although modern microservice ecosystems provide a variety of autonomous adaptation mechanisms, when focusing on the microservice itself, they can only account for changes in the sheer increase in workload volume. On the other hand, when workload patterns change, efficient treatment requires the intervention of DevOps experts to manually evolve the internal architecture of services. Given the need to quickly adapt systems to respond to changes, solely relying on DevOps to react to workload pattern changes becomes a bottleneck for future systems. To address this issue, we advance the concept of emergent microservices, that autonomously adapt and evolve their internal architectural composition to better handle changes in the pattern of incoming requests without human intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by exploring this novel concept in the context of a microservice-based Smart City platform.

The proposed approach leverages network base stations to embed mobile edge computing (MEC) services closer to the vehicles. Our approach can enable the delivery of more competitive services with reduced-latency by utilizing cooperative MEC search strategy for vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) communications as well as utilizing vehicle-level caching for vehicle to vehicle (V2V) communications between peers. The framework prototype has been implemented as a clean extension of the Mininet-WiFi emulator. Preliminary results serve as validation of the proposed framework and point out the potential benefits of the approach in mitigating WAN-latency in VANET.}

The proper deployment of these novel Internet services is imposing hard connectivity constraints, such as high transmission capacity, reliable communications, as well as an efficient control scheme capable of enabling an agile coordination of actions in large heterogeneous scenarios. In recent years, novel control schemes, such as the so-called Path Computation Element (PCE) has gained momentum in the network research community turning into real PCE implementations. Indeed, there is a wealth of studies assessing the PCE performance, clearly showing the potential benefits of decoupling routing control tasks from the forwarding nodes. Nevertheless, recognized the need for a control solution in IoT scenarios, there is not much published information analyzing PCE benefits in these IoT scenarios. In this paper, we distill how the PCE may gracefully provide for service composition in an agile manner, handling the specific constraints and requirements found in IoT scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel PCE strategy referred to as Service-Oriented PCE (SPCE), which enables network-aware service composition.}

To obtain knowledge for determining suitable routing paths as users go about their daily routine, nodes maintain history of every encounter and exchange the information through summary vectors. Due to large node populations, the size of summary vectors makes it challenging to implement real-world city-scale applications with the technology. In this paper, we take the technology a step towards real-world implementation by proposing a set of adaptive and privacy-preserving mechanisms that can be incorporated into existing encounter-based routing protocols to reduce summary vector sizes without compromising delivery guarantees. We validate our proposals with real-world human movement traces and simulation experiments. In terms of network performance, our proposals reduce the average summary vector size by 75% to achieve up to 21% less energy consumption with about 28% improvement in throughput.}

This topic has been discussed with greater emphasis in conjunction with environmental issues, driven by changes in the most diverse fields provided by the recent post-pandemic scenario. However, due to traditional or inefficient waste management approaches, most trash bins placed in cities can be seen as overflowing. Therefore, a remote monitoring system is needed to alert the level of garbage in bins to the relevant authority for waste clearance. In this scenario, the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm plays a vital role in improving smart city applications by tracking and managing city processes. This paper implements a solution based on Low-Power Wide-Area Network (LPWAN) and blockchain technologies to provide the required data available for increasing efficiency in solid waste collection. Finally, this paper provides an evaluation of the proposed architecture related to latency and throughput metrics.}

The end goal is to leverage the use of city resources to improve the quality of life of its citizens. Achieving this goal, however, requires advanced support for the development and operation of applications in a complex and dynamic environment. Middleware platforms can provide an integrated infrastructure that enables solutions for smart cities by combining heterogeneous city devices and providing unified, high-level facilities for the development of applications and services. Although several smart city platforms have been proposed in the literature, there are still open research and development challenges related to their scalability, maintainability, interoperability, and reuse in the context of different cities, to name a few. Moreover, available platforms lack extensive scientific validation, which hinders a comparative analysis of their applicability. Aiming to close this gap, we propose InterSCity, a microservices-based, open-source, smart city platform that enables the collaborative development of large-scale systems, applications, and services for the cities of the future, contributing to turn them into truly smart cyber–physical environments. In this paper, we present the architecture of the InterSCity platform, followed by a comprehensive set of experiments that evaluate its scalability. The experiments were conducted using a smart city simulator to generate realistic workloads used to assess the platform in extreme conditions. The experimental results demonstrate that the platform can scale horizontally to handle the highly dynamic demands of a large smart city while maintaining low response times. The experiments also show the effectiveness of the technique used to generate synthetic workloads.}

In order to guarantee the strictest quality of service and quality of experience requirements for users, new architectures have been proposed in the literature for metropolitan optical networks, with a growing interest in the last five years.

Due to the population growing rate, new issues are still arising, but technology can be used to address such issues and improve life quality in big cities. In that scenario, surveillance is a highly desired service and most governments are already using different types of devices to provide high levels of security. Wireless Visual Sensor Networks (WVSN) can be used to monitor every part of a city without the cost of running cables all over it. However, there must be an efficient way to gather all information collected by the sensors and cameras, with reduced energy consumption and average latency. This work proposes a new algorithm to position multiple mobile sinks in WVSN deployed along roads and streets. A relevance-based approach was designed to position sinks closer to source nodes with higher sensing relevance, since they are expected to transmit more data packets. The proposed algorithm can detect forbidden and disconnected zones, making sure sinks will be positioned in permitted areas, which makes this approach very suitable for realistic smart city applications.}

However, although the benefits of such units are well known, their proper positioning in a city is challenging when considering a limited set of available units. In this sense, data-driven approaches can be leveraged to provide a better perception of the urban environments under consideration, allowing emergency management systems to be tailored to the specificities of a target city, thus improving the positioning of EDUs. This article proposes the processing of geospatial data of emergency-related urban infrastructure to support the computing of risk zones in a city, which is retrieved from the OpenStreetMap database together with the map of streets within a defined area. Since risk zones indirectly indicate the proportional number of detection units to be deployed, for each configuration setting of the EDUs, we propose an algorithm that computes the positions for such units only on streets, in a balanced way. Furthermore, considering that EDUs are expected to report detected emergencies through a wireless connection, we have also modelled the coverage area of existing networks in a city, which is also processed according to a suitable dataset. The proposed algorithm performs a fine-grained positioning of EDUs based on the number of active networks, flexibly favouring the EDUs' connectivity requirements such as reliability, throughput, latency, and transmission costs according to the actual demands of any urban emergency management system. Experimental results with real data demonstrated the applicability of the proposed mathematical model and the associated algorithm, reinforcing its practical application for the planning and construction of smart cities.}

In this work, we present an efficient and robust framework to recognize anomalies from surveillance Big Video Data (BVD) using Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). Smart surveillance is an important application of AIoT and we propose a two-stream neural network in this direction. The first stream comprises instant anomaly detection that is functional over resource-constrained IoT devices, whereas second phase is a two-stream deep neural network allowing for detailed anomaly analysis, suited to be deployed as a cloud computing service. Firstly, a self-pruned fine-tuned lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) classifies the ongoing events as normal or anomalous in an AIoT environment. Upon anomaly detection, the edge device alerts the concerned departments and transmits the anomalous frames to cloud analysis center for their detailed evaluation in the second phase. The cloud analysis center resorts to the proposed two-stream network, modeled from the integration of spatiotemporal and optical flow features through the sequential frames. Fused features flow through a bi-directional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) layer, which classifies them into their respective anomaly classes, e.g., assault and abuse. We perform extensive experiments over benchmarks built on top of the UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 datasets to test the effectiveness of our framework. We report a 9.88% and 4.01% increase in accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art methods evaluated over the aforementioned datasets.}

Therefore, using artificial intelligence method, we propose a solution of inter-vehicle communication for estimating the congestion level to maximize the vehicle traffic flow in the transport system, called TRAFFIC. For this, we modeled an ensemble of classifiers to estimate the congestion level using TRAFFIC. Hence, the ensemble classification is used as an input to the proposed dissemination mechanism, through which information is propagated between the vehicles. By comparing TRAFFIC with other studies in the literature, our solution has advanced the state of the art with new contributions as follows: (i) increase in the success rate for estimating the traffic congestion level; (ii) reduction in travel time, fuel consumption and CO2 emission of the vehicle; and (iii) high coverage rate with higher propagation of the message, maintaining a low packet transmission rate.}

It also characterizes faults, errors and failures that may occur in these systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first review that provides a broad picture of the research area and points out research limitations and directions. We selected 43 primary studies and performed initial classifications (e.g., based on type of research, type of contribution, application domains and subdomains, and type of system architecture). We further classified and discussed the selected studies based on types of fault tolerance techniques and types of faults and failures. System Reconfiguration, Diversity, and Retry are classical techniques that have been investigated in this domain. Many fault and failure types have also been addressed. While those well-known techniques have been explored for introducing fault tolerance capabilities into Smart City Applications, others have been overlooked. Moreover, evidence on the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed fault tolerance solutions is still very limited.

Since these systems are embedded in a critical and dynamic environment, it is really important to have an infrastructure that is capable of providing real-time environmental information. This paper discusses two research questions that arise from adaptive ubicomp systems: (i) what are the key requirements to provide a reliable WSN-based system (e.g. a river monitoring system)? and (ii) how can an adaptable and reliable WSN-based system be developed? This paper seeks to respond to the former question with the aid of the RESS standard platform. The latter question is answered by employing a generic approach for adaptation. The term “critical systems”, means that any error may result in the loss of human life. We devised the RESS standard after deploying the WSN-based river monitoring system in Brazil for five years. Our prototype underwent several trials, sometimes leading to failure or damage, before we came up with a more reliable solution, which is outlined in this article. Finally, while our RESS platform is policy-free, it is extensible/adaptable and hence can naturally be adapted to new policies.}

These objects are assigned to their respective IP addresses, and they are able to send and receive data over a network without any human assistance. IoT offers different types of applications, such as, but not limited to, smart traffic monitoring, smart home, smart health care and smart cities, to name a few. In a Cyber-Physical System (CPS), computing elements coordinate and communicate with sensor devices, which monitor cyber and physical indicators, and actuators, and also modify the cyber and physical environment where they run. The synergy of computational as well as physical components, specifically the use of CPSs, led to the advancement of IoT implementations. In a cloud-driven IoT-based big data environment, a cloud-based platform is used to store the data generated by IoT devices (normally by sensor devices) which further can be considered as a big data warehouse. This environment is highly scalable and provides important real-time event processing (for example, in critical scenarios like surveillance and monitoring of an industrial plant). In IoT-based critical applications, the real-time data access is obligatory as and when it is required. Such access is possible if we permit only authorized external users to access the real-time data directly from the IoT sensors. Sometimes authorized user may also request for big data query processing and big data analytics over the data stored in cloud servers to figure out hidden patterns of some phenomena (i.e., chances of fire in an industrial plant in future). Therefore, we need secure authentication schemes for cloud-driven IoT-based big data environment in which a legitimate user and an IoT sensor can mutually authenticate each other and establish a common session key for secure communication. In this context, this paper first discusses the network and threat models of the authentication schemes for cloud-driven IoT-based big data environment. Some security requirements, issues and challenges of this environment are then discussed. A taxonomy of various existing authentication schemes applicable for cloud-driven IoT-based big data environment is also discussed, which covers a comparative study of these schemes.

In the military context, IoT applications can support the decision-making process by delivering information collected directly from the battlefield to Command, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems. Taking the benefit of the installed IoT network in the battlefield, the use of the data collected by the IoT nodes is a way to improve resiliency and increase the survivability of networks, as well as to optimize the use of available resources. Towards improving the communication network present on the battlefield, this work presents a context-aware environmental monitoring system that uses real-time battlefield information to increase military networks’ resilience and survivability. The proposed approach is validated by a proof-of-concept experiment. The obtained results show that the implementation of this system can improve the communication process even when the network is exposed to unfavorable climatic factors.}

Specifically, the study of data-driven solutions to understand the behavior of cities and propose services to enhance the experiences of the citizens in their everyday life has become an active research topic. Many studies in this topic focus on exploring single data sources, and, to tackle this limitation we propose the SMAFramework to collect and integrate urban mobility data from heterogeneous sources. In this work, we propose a methodology that enables the standardization of spatiotemporal annotated data from sources such as Sensor Networks, Vehicular Networks, Social Media and the Web over a single data model (i.e., a Multi-Aspect Graph) and perform different analyses, such as the identification of taxi demand. To show the potential of this framework, we built and assessed a tool to evaluate spatiotemporal correlation of urban data from different sources. Real data collected from social media and a taxi system of the city of New York are used to evaluate this method. The obtained results allowed us to understand some of the applicabilities of the SMAFramework and also provided some insights on how to use it to resolve specific problems when analyzing mobility in urban environments. Using this methodology, we can obtain a better taxi positioning within the city by employing social media data.}

However, covering the whole city area with static sensors might be expensive. This paper addresses the utilization of the public transportation system as a mobility platform for sensor nodes and bus stops acting as sinks. This platform can improve the coverage of a sensor network and take advantage of opportunistic communication. Since this platform can be used for delay-constrained applications, we propose an algorithm to choose sensor sinks in the bus stops of a smart city that minimizes the maximum delay when delivering messages. We compare our solution with an optimal formulation and use real data, obtained in buses from Rio de Janeiro, as an input of our algorithm. Our experiments show that we can use approximately 16% of bus stops as sinks, having less than 10% of increase in the network maximum delay and no significant loss in the spatial coverage.}

However, this trend inevitably leaves a massive amount of information and infrastructure connected to the public Internet, which exposes the data to many security threats and challenges. In this paper, we discuss the need for fine-grained user access control for IoT smart devices. The inherently distributed nature of IoT environment necessitates the support of multi-authority attribute-based encryption (ABE) for the implementation of fine-grained access control. Therefore, we present a secure fine-grained user access control scheme for data usage in the IoT environment. The proposed scheme is a three-factor user access control scheme, which supports multi-authority ABE and it is highly scalable as both the ABE key size stored in the user’s smart card and ciphertext size needed for authentication request are constant with respect to the number of attributes. Through the formal and informal security analysis, we show that the proposed scheme is secure and robust against several potential attacks required in an IoT environment. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs at par or better than existing schemes while providing greater functionality features.}

abstract = {Smart cities is an emerging concept that allows the usage of technology to improve the quality and efficiency of services delivered to the population of a given city, considering a vast application domain. Some applications, like smart surveillance using Internet of Things sensors demand the transmission of high amounts of traffic with strict quality of service, what may not be available at all times. One solution to deal with this traffic overload is to implement the concept of resources sharing. Considering this context, in this article, a heterogeneous network scenario is considered to implement a multi-purpose real time video surveillance application which can be applied to both smart cities and military surveillance such as borderline security. The proposed solution considers three crucial aspects: the QoS requirements of the real time video application; the cost-benefit of the spectrum allocation; and the time constraints involved in a vertical handover operation to avoid interference. The main contribution of the article are: (I) inclusion of a multilevel resources broker in the Smart Cities architecture, (II) a QoS-enabled solution for video surveillance to provide borderline security, and (III) a low overhead control mechanism to avoid interfering with the legitimate network traffic. Results obtained via simulations show that after the proposed solution is implemented delay and jitter are kept below their specific thresholds and therefore the QoS is guaranteed considering the coexistence of up to 500 IoT sensors. Nearly 70% of the traffic is accommodated either in IEEE 802.11 or IEEE 802.22 networks, which offer relatively low cost resources. These results are also compared with two state of the art related works and show that the proposed solution performs better than the related work in the analyzed scenarios. Finally, with respect to the time constraints, the implementation of the proposed solution leads to fast vertical handover, attaining times up to 46% lower than the maximum allowed handover duration.}

abstract = {Smart cities are nowadays equipped with pervasive networks of sensors that monitor traffic in real-time and record huge volumes of traffic data. These datasets constitute a rich source of information that can be used to extract knowledge useful for municipalities and citizens. In this paper we are interested in exploiting such data to estimate future speed in traffic sensor networks, as accurate predictions have the potential to enhance decision making capabilities of traffic management systems. Building effective speed prediction models in large cities poses important challenges that stem from the complexity of traffic patterns, the number of traffic sensors typically deployed, and the evolving nature of sensor networks. Indeed, sensors are frequently added to monitor new road segments or replaced/removed due to different reasons (e.g., maintenance). Exploiting a large number of sensors for effective speed prediction thus requires smart solutions to collect vast volumes of data and train effective prediction models. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of real-world sensor networks calls for solutions that are resilient not only to changes in traffic behavior, but also to changes in the network structure, where the cold start problem represents an important challenge. We study three different approaches in the context of large and dynamic sensor networks: local, global, and cluster-based. The local approach builds a specific prediction model for each sensor of the network. Conversely, the global approach builds a single prediction model for the whole sensor network. Finally, the cluster-based approach groups sensors into homogeneous clusters and generates a model for each cluster. We provide a large dataset, generated from ∼1.3 billion records collected by up to 272 sensors deployed in Fortaleza, Brazil, and use it to experimentally assess the effectiveness and resilience of prediction models built according to the three aforementioned approaches. The results show that the global and cluster-based approaches provide very accurate prediction models that prove to be robust to changes in traffic behavior and in the structure of sensor networks.}

The primary goal of smart-wise cities is to improve the quality of life for all citizens while protecting the environment. Different from smart cities, technology is not a priority. Technologies are used as a means to achieve goals.

Although several privacy mechanisms have been proposed to solve anonymization problems, there are few studies about their behavior and analysis of the data quality anonymized by these techniques. This paper presents an anonymization quality framework for mix-zones enabling characterizing and evaluating the impacts of anonymization over time and space in mobility data. We conducted experiments with a cab mobility dataset and two positioning algorithms to explore one of the potentialities of the anonymization quality: elect mix-zones that do not consider the traffic but its operating requirements too. The results showed that the anonymization quality enabled the selection of mix-zones that yield data anonymization considering the quality, privacy, and utility analysis. This study is unique because it analyzes mix-zone coverage and quality metrics to observe the anonymization quality not found in the literature.}

Monitoring the trees is one of the tasks among the several urban forest assessment procedures. Trees with a risk of falling may threaten the locals and the infrastructure of the cities, thereby being an immediate concern for forestry managers. In general, a set of measures and aspects are collected from field survey analysis to estimate whether the trees represent a risk to the safety of the urban spaces. However, gathering the tree's physical measures in fieldwork campaigns is time-consuming and laborious considering the massive number of trees in the cities. Therefore, there is an urge for new computational-based methodologies, especially those related to the latest advances in artificial intelligence, to accelerate the assessment of trees in the municipality areas. In this sense, this work aims at using several machine learning-based methods in the context of tree condition inspection. Particularly, we present the prediction of the tree failure probability by using several aspects collected over time from fieldwork campaigns, with a special focus on external physical measures of the trees. Further, we provide the samples with their respective tree failure probability values as a new open dataset for further investigations on tree status monitoring. We also present a novel dataset composed of images of trees with bounding boxes delineations of the tree, trunk, and crown for automating the tree monitoring tasks. Regarding the tree failure probability estimation, we compared several regression algorithms for estimating the tree failure likelihood. Moreover, we propose a stacking generalization approach to enhance forecast accuracy and minimize prediction errors. The results showed the viability of the proposed method as an auxiliary tool in tree analysis tasks, which attained the lowest average Mean Absolute Error of 5.6901±1.1709 yielded by the stacking generalization model.}

In this context, radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting (FP)-based localization methods are attractive due to their lower implementation cost, lower energy consumption, and better performance in non-line-of-sight conditions compared to GPS. With this in mind, we propose an RF FP-based localization method using an irregular grid map generation strategy. The grid map segmentation procedure is based on the assumption that the RF measurements collected in a region carry information on how users are often spatially distributed. The algorithms employed in the irregular grid map generation are the farthest-first traversal and low-discrepancy R-sequence. Different irregular grid map generators are compared with each other and with the regular grid map. We evaluate the generators in two different scenarios: with measurements obtained through simulation with ns-3 and via a driving-test procedure in an urban area. Numerical results indicate that our proposed irregular generator presents a lower localization error in both scenarios and is the only one capable of meeting one of the accuracy requirements stated by the Federal Communications Commission that demands a localization error of up to 50m in 80% of the emergency calls.}

Recent improvements in multimedia over VANETs allow drivers, passengers, and rescue teams to capture, share, and access on-road multimedia services. Vehicles can cooperate with each other to transmit live flows of traffic accidents or disasters and provide drivers, passengers, and rescue teams rich visual information about a monitored area. Since humans will watch the videos, their distribution must be done by considering the provided Quality of Experience (QoE) even in multi-hop, multi-path, and dynamic environments. This article introduces an application framework to handle this kind of services and a routing protocol, the DBD (Distributed Beaconless Dissemination), that enhances the dissemination of live video flows on multimedia highway VANETs. DBD uses a backbone-based approach to create and maintain persistent and high quality routes during the video delivery in opportunistic Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) scenarios. It also improves the performance of the IEEE 802.11p MAC layer, by solving the Spurious Forwarding (SF) problem, while increasing the packet delivery ratio and reducing the forwarding delay. Performance evaluation results show the benefits of DBD compared to existing works in forwarding videos over VANETs, where main objective and subjective QoE results are measured.}

In this sense, the present literature review aims to update the joint subject of IoT and vital signs, seeking to understand the state-of-the-art and future directions.

The first is the connection promotion between third-party applications and IoT devices to collect and process time-critical data with the support of edge, fog, and cloud infrastructures. The second theme again brings the focus to data compression methodologies since monitoring vital signs in a smart city geographical area naturally requires strategies to optimize network bandwidth consumption and data storage on computational resources.

abstract = {Smart cities can be seen as large-scale Cyber-Physical Systems with sensors monitoring cyber and physical indicators and with actuators dynamically changing the complex urban environment in some way. In this context, urban sensing is a new paradigm that exploits human-carried or vehicle-mounted sensors to ubiquitously collect data to provide a holistic view of the city. A challenge in this scenario is the transmission of sensed data in situations where the networking infrastructure is intermittent or unavailable. This paper outlines our research into an engine that uses opportunistic networks to support the data transmission of urban sensing applications. It applies situation awareness and computational intelligence approaches to perform routing, adaptation, and decision-making procedures. We carried out simulations within a simulated environment that showed our engine had 12% less overhead than other compared approaches.}

However, implementing a system for continuous monitoring of the population’s vital signs, with data being streamed from various locations within a smart city context, faces significant challenges. These challenges are related to bandwidth consumption, communication latency, and storage capacity due to the large volume of data. To overcome these challenges, a common practice consists in modeling an edge-fog-cloud layered architecture. The literature lacks software solutions capable of managing the simultaneous transmission of various vital signs data from geographically distributed individuals while maintaining the ability to generate health notifications promptly. In this context, we propose the VSAC (Vital Sign Adaptive Compressor) model, which combines lossy and lossless data compression algorithms in a layered architecture to support healthcare demands in a smart city. The main contribution is how we blend both strategies: we first use lossy compression to collect only valuable vital sign data for everyone, applying lossless algorithms afterwards to reduce the number of bytes before sending it to higher layers. We provide a real-time processing protocol that facilitates the collection of heterogeneous data distributed across different city regions. After executing a VSAC prototype, the results indicate that orchestrating the aforementioned two data compression algorithms is more efficient than conventional data reduction methods. In particular, we obtained gains of up to 42% when measuring the compression rate metric.}

abstract = {Currently, Internet applications running on mobile devices generate a massive amount of data that can be transmitted to a Cloud for processing. However, one fundamental limitation of a Cloud is the connectivity with end devices. Fog computing overcomes this limitation and supports the requirements of time-sensitive applications by distributing computation, communication, and storage services along the Cloud to Things (C2T) continuum, empowering potential new applications, such as smart cities, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR). However, the adoption of Fog-based computational resources and their integration with the Cloud introduces new challenges in resource management, which requires the implementation of new strategies to guarantee compliance with the quality of service (QoS) requirements of applications. In this context, one major question is how to map the QoS requirements of applications on Fog and Cloud resources. One possible approach is to discriminate the applications arriving at the Fog into Classes of Service (CoS). This paper thus introduces a set of CoS for Fog applications which includes, the QoS requirements that best characterize these Fog applications. Moreover, this paper proposes the implementation of a typical machine learning classification methodology to discriminate Fog computing applications as a function of their QoS requirements. Furthermore, the application of this methodology is illustrated in the assessment of classifiers in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness to noise. The adoption of a methodology for machine learning-based classification constitutes a first step towards the definition of QoS provisioning mechanisms in Fog computing. Moreover, classifying Fog computing applications can facilitate the decision-making process for Fog scheduler.}

Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques present powerful frameworks for optimizing traffic signal controllers that learn to respond to real-time traffic changes. Multiagent RL (MARL) techniques have been showing better results over centralized techniques (RL-based or not), where local intersection agents have partial observation of and control over the environment. Since in TSC the best decision does not depend only on local information, in the present paper we aim at increasing agents’ views by using a hierarchical approach, where information is passed upwards, is then aggregated forming recommendations that are sent downwards. We divide the transportation network into regions, each controlled by a region agent; this is done at different hierarchical levels. The traffic signal controllers, located at the intersections, are the local agents at the hierarchy’s bottom. Region agents can supervise intersection agents or other region agents. Evaluation of this approach in a synthetic traffic grid shows that the proposed hierarchical organization outperforms a fixed-time approach and an RL-based approach without hierarchy.}

In this paper, we intend to clarify the main notions involved in the HCI phenomenon, by establishing an explicit conceptualization of it. To do so, we need to understand what interactive computer systems are, which types of actions users perform when interacting with an interactive computer system, and finally what human–computer interaction itself is. The conceptualization is presented as a core reference ontology, called HCIO (HCI Ontology), which is grounded in the Unified Foundational Ontology (UFO).

Intelligent boards are embedded in the cameras allowing a distributed processing and communication. The task of looking for free parking spaces demands a significant amount of drivers׳ time. This problem generally takes place in urban areas where there is a large number of vehicles and few available parking spaces (on-street or off-street). Decreasing the time spent in this task could reduce the traffic jam or, in an extreme perspective, alleviate the toxic gases emission or the fossil combustible consumption. Initially, it was evaluated three classical techniques for image processing applied to detect free on-street parking. The best one presents a success detection rate close to 100%. After that, it was evaluated the performance of the embedded system by using only the best image processing technique. This performance evaluation considers three different scenarios: centralized, hybrid, and embedded. The last one is the main proposal and contribution. The results reveal that embedded proposal had an average requisition time of 2.10s vs. 0.38s of centralized one. The hybrid one presents the worst results.}

abstract = {Context
Emerging paradigms like Internet of Things and Smart Cities utilize advanced sensing and communication infrastructures, where heterogeneity is an inherited feature. Applications targeting such environments require adaptability and context-sensitivity to uncertain availability and failures in resources and their ad-hoc networks. Such heterogeneity is often hard to predict, making the deployment process a challenging task.
Objective
This paper proposes GoalD as a goal-driven framework to support autonomous deployment of heterogeneous computational resources to fulfill requirements, seen as goals, and their correlated components on one hand, and the variability space of the hosting computing and sensing environment on the other hand.
Method
GoalD comprises an offline and an online stage to fulfill autonomous deployment by leveraging the use of goals. Deployment configuration strategies arise from the variability structure of the Contextual Goal Model as an underlying structure to guide autonomous planning by selecting available as well as suitable resources at runtime.
Results
We evaluate GoalD on an existing exemplar from the self-adaptive systems community – the Tele Assistance Service provided by Weyns and Calinescu [1]. Furthermore, we evaluate the scalability of GoalD on a repository consisting of 430,500 artifacts. The evaluation results demonstrate the usefulness and scalability of GoalD in planning the deployment of a system with thousands of components in a few milliseconds.
Conclusion
GoalD is a framework to systematically tackle autonomous deployment in highly heterogeneous computing environments, partially unknown at design-time following a goal-oriented approach to achieve the user goals in a target environment. GoalD has demonstrated itself able to scale for deployment planning dealing with thousands of components in a few milliseconds.}

A technology that has been widely used in these contexts is the Wireless Smart Ubiquitous Networks Field Area Network (Wi-SUN FAN) standard, which defines the implementation and behavior of interoperable networks based on open standards such as IEEE 802.15.4 and the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL). The adopted standards allow Wi-SUN FAN networks to take advantage of features such as security, frequency hopping, multi-hop packet routing, and IPv6 addressing, ensuring a wide coverage area and immunity against electromagnetic interference. Despite all the advantages, a shortcoming of Wi-SUN FAN networks is the long network formation time. In this article, we propose a mechanism called Fast Routing Recovery (FRR), which aims to accelerate the reconnection process in networks that use the RPL protocol by memorizing information about the nodes’ preferred parents. We evaluate the FRR mechanism by simulations and experiments. The results indicate that FRR can reduce the network formation time by up to 50% in certain network scenarios.}

abstract = {Time series are prevalent data in finance, smart cities, sensor networks, engineering, bioinformatics, among other domains. These data differ from regular tabular data as they involve sequences of observations at successive, equally spaced points in time. The temporal ordering of observations in time series carries significant information, making pattern detection in subsequences crucial for supervised learning tasks such as forecasting and classification. Current classification methods often overlook the potential of transformations that represent time series as images. Visual representations such as Recurrence Plots and Markov Transition Fields capture intricate temporal dynamics and spatial patterns that traditional one-dimensional approaches might miss. We propose Visemble, an efficient and accurate ensemble method for time series classification that leverages multiple visual representations and weighted soft voting. Besides our proposal, we present a broader discussion regarding time series imaging representations. Visemble combines the original time domain representation, first-order differences, and various two-dimensional representations. Our ensemble integrates accurate and diverse classifiers to improve the classification performance of individual imaging based models efficiently using Random Forest. A comprehensive experimental evaluation with hundreds benchmark datasets from varying domains demonstrated that Visemble achieves comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art ensemble based methods, such as Elastic Ensemble, BOSS, and Temporal Dictionary Ensemble, but with significantly reduced computational time.}

However, to perform service composition in such dynamic environments, where availability of resources is far from uncertain, there are many challenges that must be overcome. The way the human brain works allows it to configure itself to perform specific tasks, just like a service composition arranges a set of services to achieve a goal, and is capable to adapt to changes in its environment, providing us with a great degree of resilience, something very valuable for dealing with dynamic environments. In this work, we propose a model whereby the various modules of the Cuāyōllōtl Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architecture (BICA), which will be in charge of managing the different devices of a pervasive system, are to be configured to create a workflow that employs only the required modules to achieve an objective, in a similar fashion to how conventional service composition approaches produce composite services.}

abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has been a hot topic in both academia and industry for the last few years. There are many possible applications, in fields as smart cities, home automation, smart buildings, agriculture, automated metering, logistic, industrial automation, among others. Such a wide range of applications resulted in various technological solutions in order to enable Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications, in which we highlight those for wide area networks. In that sense, two widely used sub-GHz protocols for Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) communications are: Long Range (LoRa), using the upper layers defined by Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN); and IEEE 802.15.4g, using the upper layers defined by IPv6 over the Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode of IEEE 802.15.4e (6TiSCH). While LoRaWAN is a well-known and widespread protocol, 6TiSCH offers IPv6 connectivity to LPWA networks and is used in important standards such as Wireless Smart Ubiquitous Network (Wi-SUN). This paper aims at determining how well each protocol scales, analyzing different aspects such as packet loss, delay, and the maximum number of nodes per square area. In order to achieve such results, computer simulations are performed using open-source simulators. The obtained results demonstrate that the best scalability depends on which scenarios are considered. For scenarios with multiple gateways requiring low latency or low packet transmission rates, LoRaWAN demonstrates better results. However, in scenarios with high packet transmission rates and where the latency is not a major concern, 6TiSCH is more appropriate. Moreover, even in the best case, the latency associated with the LoRaWAN technology may be considerably smaller than associated with 6TiSCH. Such novelty results are obtained in a fair and realistic way and, noting that both technologies could be used to build LPWA networks, it can help system designers to decide between the two technologies.}

Nevertheless, multiple concurrent sensing applications may have different levels of criticality according to the impact of the performed tasks for the protection of people’s integrity and thus they should be treated in different ways. This article then proposes a prioritization approach to guide the development of sensors-based applications in smart city scenarios, which will be differentiated based on their monitoring objectives, some contextual prioritization parameters and the detection of critical events. This approach will also define security mechanisms to ensure that all sensor nodes will follow the defined prioritization policies for the considered smart cities. Besides simulation results, the proposed definitions and mechanisms were completely implemented for additional validation, resulting in a set of codes to facilitate the construction of practical sensor applications based on the proposed approach.}
