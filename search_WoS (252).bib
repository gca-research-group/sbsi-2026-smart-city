Title = {5G enabled smart cities: A real-world evaluation and analysis of 5G
   using a pilot smart city application},
Journal = {INTERNET OF THINGS},

Abstract = {Ubiquitous sensing in smart cities is expected to be one of the key
   beneficiaries of the high bandwidth and low latency capabilities of 5G.
   However, current 5G deployments still have low population coverage, and
   are unlikely to reach global coverage of above 80\% before 2028. This
   means that new smart city applications are likely to experience a
   combination of 4G and 5G, limiting their data-intensive capabilities.
   Thus, it is necessary to assess the ability of current 5G deployments to
   support emerging smart city applications, and how they perform in 5G
   environments. Existing performance evaluations focus either on the 5G
   core or use instantaneous speed tests, which do not effectively assess
   the suitability of 5G deployments for smart city applications. In this
   paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation and analysis of real-world
   5G network performance observed through the outcomes of a pilot smart
   city application, an innovative mobile 5G Internet of Things (IoT)
   solution to automatically identify and report road assets requiring
   maintenance. The pilot smart city application was deployed on 11 waste
   collection service trucks over a 6 month period (June 2022-Dec 2022). We
   undertook both application-specific and application independent network
   performance evaluation to assess the ability of the 5G deployment to
   support uninterrupted smart city services. Our analysis shows that while
   5G is capable of supporting mobile video streaming applications, there
   are significant variations in network performance, which may make it
   unsuitable for applications that require higher data intensive or near
   real-time responsiveness.},

Abstract = {ICT governance in smart cities refers to efficient ICT public investment
   to guide cities in the achievement of their strategic goals so that
   cities would be able to provide a better quality of life for citizens.
   Thus, ICT governance in smart cities comes to be a relevant domain of
   study to increase public value for the local community. Nevertheless,
   few studies focused on ICT governance in smart cities, especially in the
   Brazilian context, which evidenced a gap research in this domain.
   Empirical studies developed in Brazilian smart cities revealed lack of
   an ICT governance approach in the municipalities. Therefore, in this
   work, by applying a survey conducted with Brazilian professionals
   involved with smart city projects, governance, and information
   technology in the public sector, we introduce a set of challenges,
   lessons learned, and recommendations concerning ICT governance in smart
   city projects. The findings are of great importance for academics and
   practitioners involved with cities' public management concerning
   ICT-enabled governance.},

Abstract = {The present article addresses how smart city initiatives can positively
   impact development, with a special emphasis on developing countries.
   Extant definitions and maturity models on smart cities have a very
   strong focus on the mere use of Information and Communication Technology
   (ICT), thereby ignoring the special needs and factors to be considered
   in developing countries. Thus, by using the extant literature on Smart
   Cities and Information and Communication Technology for Development
   (ICT4D), a comprehensive Smart City for Development (SC4D) model is
   introduced. The article argues that a favorable ecosystem for SC4D is
   one that is backed by both national and local sustainability,
   infrastructure, human capital, services, apps, and data. Moreover,
   successful SC4D initiatives include bottom-up approaches, citizen
   participation, a fit with both the national and the local culture, as
   well as a fit with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and
   the Capability Approach.},

Abstract = {Smart cities typically involve a myriad of interconnected systems
   intended to promote better management of urban and natural resources of
   cities, thereby contributing to the improve the quality of life of
   citizens. The heterogeneity of domains, systems, data, and relationships
   among them requires defining a data model able to express information in
   a flexible, extensible way while promoting interoperability between
   systems and applications. Furthermore, smart city systems can benefit
   from georeferenced information to allow for more effective actions over
   the real-world urban space. Aiming at tackling challenges related to
   data heterogeneity while considering georeferenced information, this
   work introduces LGeoSIM, a semantic-based information model for smart
   cities as means of fostering interoperability and powerful automated
   reasoning upon unambiguous information. LGeoSIM relies on the recent
   NGSI-LD Specification, thereby encompassing the principles of Linked
   Data to allow semantically defining information through ontologies and
   their interconnection. This paper also presents an implementation of
   LGeoSIM within Smart Geo Layers, a geographic-layered data middleware
   platform conceived to integrate data provided by heterogeneous sources
   in a smart city environment.},

Title = {Information Security Applications in Smart Cities: A Bibliometric
   Analysis of Emerging Research},
Journal = {FUTURE INTERNET},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {This paper aims to analyze the intellectual structure and research
   fronts in application information security in smart cities to identify
   research boundaries, trends, and new opportunities in the area. It
   applies bibliometric analyses to identify the main authors and their
   influences on information security and the smart city area. Moreover,
   this analysis focuses on journals indexed in Scopus databases. The
   results indicate that there is an opportunity for further advances in
   the adoption of information security policies in government
   institutions. Moreover, the production indicators presented herein are
   useful for the planning and implementation of information security
   policies and the knowledge of the scientific community about smart
   cities. The bibliometric analysis provides support for the visualization
   of the leading research technical collaboration networks among authors,
   co-authors, countries, and research areas. The methodology offers a
   broader view of the application information security in smart city areas
   and makes it possible to assist new research that may contribute to
   further advances. The smart cities topic has been receiving much
   attention in recent years, but to the best of our knowledge, there is no
   research on reporting new possibilities for advances. Therefore, this
   article may contribute to an emerging body of literature that explores
   the nature of application information security and smart cities research
   productivity to assist researchers in better understanding the current
   emerging of the area.},

Abstract = {Smart cities emergence has allowed a wide variety of technological
   services to metropolitan areas. These services can improve life quality,
   minimize environmental impacts, improve health service, improve
   security, and bear the increasing number of people in the cities. Life
   quality encompasses many subjects, and accessibility for People with
   Disabilities (PwD) is one. In this article, smart cities focused on
   helping PwD are called Assistive Smart Cities (ASCs). In this sense, the
   article proposes a Model for Assistive Smart Cities called MASC. Related
   works do not cover geographically broad areas, such as cities and
   metropolitan regions. Moreover, they are not generic in terms of
   disabilities and are usually intended only for one type of disability.
   Given this scenario, the MASC covers large regions and supports various
   disabilities, such as hearing, visual impairment, and limitation of
   lower limb movements. Unlike the related works, MASC uses the
   interactions of PwD to compose histories of contexts offered as
   services. MASC proposes an ontology-based on ubiquitous accessibility
   concepts. The model evaluation focused on performance, functionality,
   and usability. Performance and functionality evaluations were performed
   using data generated by a context simulator called Siafu and data from
   the Open Street Maps (OSM) platform. Usability was evaluated using a
   smart wheelchair prototype. The results of usability show 96\%
   acceptance regarding ease of use and 98\% regarding system utility. The
   results indicate that the model supports massive applications, managing
   information to generate trails. Besides, MASC provides services for
   different types of users, namely PwD, healthcare professionals, and
   public administration.},

Abstract = {With the increasing availability of affordable open-source embedded
   hardware platforms, the development of low-cost programmable devices for
   uncountable tasks has accelerated in recent years. In this sense, the
   large development community that is being created around popular
   platforms is also contributing to the construction of Internet of Things
   applications, which can ultimately support the maturation of the
   smart-cities era. Popular platforms such as Raspberry Pi, BeagleBoard
   and Arduino come as single-board open-source platforms that have enough
   computational power for different types of smart-city applications,
   while keeping affordable prices and encompassing many programming
   libraries and useful hardware extensions. As a result, smart-city
   solutions based on such platforms are becoming common and the surveying
   of recent research in this area can support a better understanding of
   this scenario, as presented in this article. Moreover, discussions about
   the continuous developments in these platforms can also indicate
   promising perspectives when using these boards as key elements to build
   smart cities.},

Abstract = {This article aims to advance the debate on gender and smart cities.
   Smart cities, with technology as a basic component in urban management,
   are initiatives seen as a path towards sustainability and inclusiveness.
   Discussed by academics and practitioners to promote better living in
   urban spaces, gender issues have been neglected when studying and
   designing smart cities. Gender (in)equalities affect women's and men's
   lives in many ways, which include the different experiences and unequal
   situations in cities. By failing to address gender issues, urban spaces
   can potentially exacerbate inequalities. Additionally, disregarding
   gender issues through gender-blind policies does not make cities neutral
   but rather gendered only for a universal Subject. Based on a systematic
   and integrative literature review, we sought to answer the research
   question: Why gender shoud be considered when studying and designing
   smart cities? In addition to addressing the question, the
   intersectionality approach is presented as a means to promote gendered
   smart cities.},

Abstract = {The evolution and development of new technological solutions for smart
   cities has significantly grown in recent years. The smart city scenario
   encompasses larges amount of data from several devices and applications.
   This raises challenges related to data interoperability, including
   information sharing, receiving data from multiple sources (Web services,
   files, systems, etc.), and making them available at underlying smart
   city application development platforms. This paper presents Aqueducte, a
   service that converts data from external sources and files to the
   NGSI-LD protocol, enabling their use by applications relying on an
   NGSI-LD-based middleware. This paper describes the Aqueducte methodology
   used to: (i) extract data from heterogeneous data sources, (ii) enrich
   them according to the NGSI-LD data format using Linked Data along with
   ontologies, and (iii) publish them into an NSGI-LD-based middleware. The
   use of Aqueducte is also described in a real-world smart city scenario.},

Abstract = {The massive amount of data generated in projects focused on smart cities
   creates a degree of complexity in how to manage all this information. In
   attention to solve this problem, several approaches have been developed
   in recent years. In this paper we propose an infrastructure model for

   the stages for the processing of data in the steps of extraction,
   storage, processing and visualisation, as well as the types of tools
   needed for each phase. To implement our proposed model, we used the
   ParticipACT Brazil, which is a project based in smart cities. This
   project uses different databases to compose its big data and uses this
   data to solve urban problems. We observe that our model provides a
   structured vision of the software to be used in big data server of
   ParticipACT Brazil.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the domain of applications and information systems for
   Smart Cities (SC) has emerged and motivated researchers and
   practitioners to develop relevant solutions. The development of
   applications for SC involves many specificities, such as: (i) processing
   and analysis of large volumes of data; (ii) context-awareness; (iii)
   perception and actuation on physical elements of the city; and (iv)
   maintaining citizens' privacy and security. It is important to ensure
   that these specificities have an adequate level of quality that enables
   the daily use of these applications in these cities. However, there is
   still no consolidated set of properties and / or characteristics that
   should be considered when evaluating the quality of this specific type
   of application. The goal of this work is to identify the characteristics
   and sub-characteristics of product quality that are being considered in
   the evaluation of applications and information systems in the context of
   SC. To do this, a Mapping Study was conducted, aiming to present an
   overview of the current state of the art in product quality for this
   context. Additionally, an analysis was carried out between the product
   quality characteristics of the ISO / IEC 25010: 2011 model with the
   characteristics identified in this mapping. As a result, eight related
   works, which deal with characteristics, such as Reliability,
   Compatibility, Maintenance, and Safety have been identified. Finally,
   there is a need for more detailed specifications of characteristics that
   enable the quality assurance of SC applications.},

Title = {Guidelines for a participatory Smart City model to address Amazon's
   urban environmental problems},
Journal = {PEERJ COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Month = {DEC 12},
Abstract = {Climate change is a global challenge, and the Brazilian Amazon Forest is
   a particular concern due to the possibility of reaching a tipping point
   that could amplify environmental crises. Despite many studies on the
   Amazon Forest, this research was conducted in Manaus, the capital of
   Amazonas state, to address five gaps, including the lack of local
   citizen consultation on urban environmental issues, Smart Cities,
   decarbonization, and disruptive technologies. This study holds
   significance for the academy community, government bodies, policymakers,
   and investors, as it offers novel insights into the Amazon region and
   proposes a model to engage citizens in Smart Cities. This model could
   also guide other municipalities aspiring for participatory sustainable
   development with a decarbonization focus, mitigating future risks, and
   protecting future generations. Basically, it is an explanatory and
   applied study that employs mixed methods, including literature,
   bibliometric and documentary reviews, two questionnaires, and
   descriptive statistical approaches, organized in four phases to reach
   the following goals: (a) provide information on the main challenges
   facing humanity, the Brazilian Amazon state, and the city of Manaus; (b)
   identify the best Smart City approaches for engaging citizens in solving
   urban problems; (c) contextualize and consult Manaus City Hall about the
   effectiveness of the Smart City project; (d) investigate the perceptions
   of citizens living in Manaus on the main city's environmental problems,
   as well as their level of knowledge and interest on issues related to
   Smart Cities, decarbonization, and disruptive technologies; (e) propose
   a participatory Smart City model with recommendations. Among the result,
   the study found that the term ``Smart City{''} dominates scholarly
   publications among nineteen urban-related terms, and the five main
   environmental problems in Manaus are an increase in stream pollution,
   garbage accumulation, insufficient urban afforestation, air pollution,
   and traffic congestion. Although citizens are willing to help, the
   majority lack knowledge on Smart City and Decarbonized City issues, but
   there is a considerable interest in training related to these issues, as
   well as disruptive technologies. It was found that Amsterdam, Melbourne,
   Montreal, San Francisco, Seoul, and Taipei all have a formal model to
   engage citizens in solving their urban problems. The main conclusion is
   that, after 6 years, the Smart City Project in Manaus is a political
   fallacy, as no model, especially with a citizen participatory approach,
   has been effectively adopted. In addition, after conducting a literature
   and documentary review and analyzing 25 benchmark Smart Cities, the P-5
   model and the Citizen Engagement Kit model are proposed with 120
   approaches and guidelines for addressing the main environmental problems
   by including Manaus' citizens in the Smart City and/or decarbonization
   journey.},

Abstract = {The development of smart cities requires a broad digital network,
   technology infrastructure, services, creativity and innovation. These
   are all important components of an ecosystem that offers a better
   quality of life to society. However, to develop systems to be part of
   the smart city, it is necessary to understand the challenges and
   opportunities involved on it, especially the informal systems that are
   used by citizens and do not belong to the formal structure of public
   administration. Informal systems are created to meet the needs of
   citizens. As such, this work aims to present challenges and
   opportunities identified in this scenario. The method adopted to
   increase information on this topic was an online survey research. As a
   result, ``transport{''} was highlighted as the most cited opportunity
   and ``lack of investment{''} as the most cited challenge to be overcome
   according to the participants. As a contribution, a discussion about the
   results is carried out and allows the analysis of the identified
   opportunities and challenges so that professionals can take advantage
   and develop systems that citizens recognize as necessary to make a smart
   city.},

Abstract = {Effective quality management plays a pivotal role in ensuring the smooth
   operation of smart city systems, which have significant implications for
   safety, accessibility, affordability, and maintainability. Dependability
   of autonomous systems is of utmost importance, as achieving satisfactory
   levels of availability and reliability poses considerable challenges.
   Smart cities are characterized by interconnected sub-architectures,
   encompassing vehicle monitoring, sidewalk monitoring, and building
   monitoring, all of which need to function efficiently. Analytical models
   such as Petri nets, Markov chains, and fault trees are well-suited for
   evaluating complex scenarios in the context of smart cities. This paper
   presents analytical models that utilize fault tree and Markov chain
   techniques to assess the availability and reliability of smart city
   monitoring systems. The model is divided into shared and non-shared
   components, with non-shared components being specific to certain
   contextual applications, while shared components, such as data
   processing and electrical power, are essential for all smart city
   monitoring and management systems. The study underscores the ease with
   which the fault tree model can enhance availability by modifying failure
   requirements and resources. Case studies provide concrete examples of
   how availability improved from 95.3 to 99.8\% by varying a configuration
   known as ``KooN{''} in multiple components. This paper takes a
   comprehensive approach to evaluating the dependability of smart city
   architectures and contributes advancements, such as hierarchical
   modeling, sequential sensitivity analysis, and the ``KooN{''} analytic
   method. These contributions expand the existing knowledge and
   methodologies in smart city dependability analysis. Moreover, this work
   aims to serve as a practical tool to assist smart city managers in
   optimizing their proposals. All modeling aspects and parameters are
   detailed thoroughly to enable effective implementation of the proposed
   approach by anyone using it.},

Abstract = {While the world still struggles against the devastating effects of the
   COVID-19 pandemic, governments and organisations are discussing how new
   technologies can be exploited to relieve its impacts and how future
   pandemics can be avoided or minimised. Among the envisioned solutions,
   the development of more efficient and widespread smart city initiatives
   can improve the way critical data is retrieved, processed, stored, and
   disseminated, potentially improving the detection and mitigation of
   outbreaks while reducing the execution time when taking critical
   actions. In fact, some first responses to this pandemic are exploiting
   different technological solutions that could be ultimately adopted in
   more integrated city-scale systems, opening many possibilities.
   Therefore, this study discusses potential solutions and review recent
   approaches that can be exploited in this complex scenario, describing
   feasible and promising development trends for the construction of the
   new expected health-centric smart cities.},

Abstract = {Despite the existence of automatic systems for collecting information
   about events in the city, without information sharing by citizens, smart
   city services concepts can hardly success. Thus, the problem is not the
   existence of technology solutions for smart cities concepts, but how to
   develop services that will involve citizens to share information about
   the events in the city. Social psychology theories point out that sense
   of bellowing, perceived enjoyment, perceived reciprocal benefits, power
   of knowledge, outcome expectation and perceived status, provides an
   involvement for citizens to share information and knowledge. In this
   paper, we propose to relate those theories, with the intension to use a
   mobile augmented reality service. We created an online survey, based in
   a scenario with a video, where the participants visualize a character
   behavior sharing and getting information in the city, using a mobile
   augmented reality service. The results confirm that the participants
   accept and want to use a mobile augmented reality service in a smart
   city, and have been identify the factors that could be more associated
   with the intention to use the augmented reality technology in the smart
   city, namely perceived enjoyment, intention to share experience,
   intention to get knowledge, perceived value, perceived similarity and
   perceived reciprocal benefits. Exploring those constructs inside
   gamification solutions in this mobile augmented reality service, is
   discussed in the conclusion.},

Abstract = {In the industry 4.0 era, the visualization and real-time automatic
   monitoring of smart cities supported by the Internet of Things is
   becoming increasingly important. The use of filtering algorithms in
   smart city monitoring is a feasible method for this purpose. However,
   maintaining fast and accurate monitoring in complex surveillance
   environments with restricted resources remains a major challenge. Since
   the cognitive theory in visual monitoring is difficult to realize in
   practice, efficient monitoring of complex environments is accordingly
   hard to be achieved. Moreover, current monitoring methods do not
   consider the particularities of the human cognitive system, so the
   remonitoring ability of the process/target is weak in case of monitoring
   failure by the monitoring system. To overcome these issues, this article
   proposes a novel human short-long cognitive memory mechanism for video
   surveillance in smart cities. In this mechanism, a memory with a high
   reliability target is used as a ``long-term memory,{''} whereas a memory
   with a low reliability target is used as a ``short-term memory.{''}
   During the monitoring process, the ``short-term memory{''} and
   ``long-term memory{''} alternation strategy is combined with the stored
   target appearance characteristics, ensuring that the original model in
   the memory will not be contaminated or mislaid by changes in the
   external environment (occlusion, fast motion, motion blur, and
   background clutter). Extensive simulations showcase that the algorithm
   proposed in this article not only improves the monitoring speed without
   hindering its real-time operation but also monitors and traces the
   monitored target accurately, ultimately improving the robustness of the
   detection in complex scenery, and enabling its application to
   IoT-assisted smart cities.},

Abstract = {There is increased interest in smart vehicles acting as both data
   consumers and producers in smart cities. Vehicles can use smart city
   data for decision-making, such as dynamic routing based on traffic
   conditions. Moreover, the multitude of embedded sensors in vehicles can
   collectively produce a rich data set of the urban landscape that can be
   used to provide a range of services. Key to the success of this vision
   is a scalable and private architecture for trusted data sharing. This
   paper proposes a framework called SpeedyChain, that leverages blockchain
   technology to allow smart vehicles to share their data while maintaining
   privacy, integrity, resilience, and non-repudiation in a decentralized
   and tamper-resistant manner. Differently from traditional blockchain
   usage (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum), the proposed framework uses a
   blockchain design that decouples the data stored in the transactions
   from the block header, thus allowing fast addition of data to the
   blocks. Furthermore, an expiration time for each block is proposed to
   avoid large sized blocks. This paper also presents an evaluation of the
   proposed framework in a network emulator to demonstrate its benefits.},

Title = {Protect your data and I'll rank its utility: A framework for utility
   analysis of anonymized mobility data for smart city applications},
Journal = {AD HOC NETWORKS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {163},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {When designing smart cities' building blocks, mobility data plays a
   fundamental role in applications and services. However, mobility data
   usually comes with unrestricted location of its corresponding entities
   (e.g., citizens and vehicles) and poses privacy concerns, among them
   recovering the identity of those entities with linking attacks. Location
   Privacy Protection Mechanisms (LPPMs) based on anonymization, such as
   mix-zones, have been proposed to address the privacy of users' identity.
   Once the data is protected, a comprehensive discussion about the
   trade-off between privacy and utility happens. However, issues still
   arise about the application of anonymized data to smart city
   development: what are the smart cities applications and services that
   can best leverage mobility data anonymized by mix-zones? To answer this
   question, we propose the Utility Analysis Framework of Anonymized
   Trajectories for Smart Cities-Application Domains (UAFAT). This
   characterization framework measures the utility through twelve metrics
   related to privacy, mobility, and social, including mix-zones
   performance metrics from anonymized trajectories produced by mix-zones.
   This framework aims to identify applications and services where the
   anonymized data will provide more or less utility in various aspects.
   The results evaluated with cabs and privacy cars datasets showed that
   further characterizing it by distortion level, UAFAT ranked the smart
   cities application domains that best leverage mobility data anonymized
   by mix-zones. Also, it identified which one of the four case studies of
   smart city applications had more utility. Additionally, different
   datasets present different behaviors in terms of utility. These insights
   can contribute significantly to the utility of both open and private
   data markets for smart cities.},

Abstract = {As current changes in population disposition are increasingly focused on
   cities and mega-cities, problems associated with rapid urbanization and
   high population density are becoming very evident and are affecting the
   lives of millions of people. Thus, the development of solutions that
   make the organization and use of urban space more efficient is highly
   necessary. From this need arises the concept of Smart Cities. Upon
   searching for applications that embodied the Smart Cities concept in the
   context of reporting issues in public spaces, a new application was
   developed. GO! Cidade is an innovative application for iOS which uses
   the power of mobile crowdsourcing to enable collaborative mapping of the
   problems in public spaces such as parks, streets or roads. To verify its
   effectiveness, this application was tested for two months by four people
   in the city of Aracaju-SE, Brazil.},

Abstract = {With the advancement of Information and Communication Technologies
   (ICTs) in providing newtools for interaction between citizens and
   government agents, public participation has been improved, allowing
   access to a more significant number of participants in the public policy

   initiatives.
   These specific ICTs may be seen as generators of information systems,
   which promote processes and social values among citizens and public
   agents acting as users. This research is a descriptive one, that
   presents six cases of technologies for improvement of social
   participation, and which can be potentially useful for smart city
   development through institutions termed living labs. The paper describes
   real cases analyzed under the perspective of information systems,
   presenting challenges and results aligned to six models of use of ICTs
   for improvement of social participation, as proposed by {[}1]. The

Abstract = {Emerging IoT applications with stringent requirements on latency and
   data processing have posed many challenges to cloud-centric platforms
   for Smart Cities. Recently, Fog Computing has been advocated as a
   promising approach to support such new applications and handle the
   increasing volume of IoT data and devices. The Fog Computing paradigm is
   characterized by a horizontal system-level architecture where devices
   close to end-users and IoT devices are used for processing, storage, and
   networking functions. Fog Computing platforms aim to facilitate the
   development of applications and systems for Smart Cities by providing
   services and abstractions designed to integrate data from IoT devices
   and various information systems deployed in the city. Despite the
   potential of the Fog Computing paradigm, the literature still lacks a
   broad, comprehensive overview of what has been investigated on the use
   of such paradigm in platforms for Smart Cities and open issues to be
   addressed in future research and development. In this paper, a
   systematic mapping study was performed and we present a comprehensive
   understanding of the use of the Fog Computing paradigm in Smart Cities
   platforms, providing an overview of the current state of research on
   this topic, and identifying important gaps in the existing approaches
   and promising research directions.},

Abstract = {Research and development of applications for smart cities are extremely
   relevant considering the various problems that population growth will
   bring to large urban centers in the next few years. Although research on
   cyber-physical systems, cloud computing, embedded devices, sensor and
   actuator networks, and participatory sensing, among other paradigms, is
   driving the growth of solutions, there are a lot of challenges that need
   to be addressed. Based on these observations, in this work, we present
   an integrated system architecture for decision-making support and urban
   planning by introducing its building blocks (termed components):
   sensing/actuation, local processing, communication, cloud platform, and
   application components. In the sensing/actuation component, we present
   the major relevant resources for data collection, identification
   devices, and actuators that can be used in smart city solutions.
   Sensing/actuation component is followed by the local processing
   component, which is responsible for processing, decision-making support,
   and control in local scale. The communication component, as the
   connection element among all these components, is presented with an
   emphasis on the open-access metropolitan area network and cellular
   networks. The cloud platform is the essential component for urban
   planning and integration with electronic governance legacy systems, and
   finally, the application component, in which the government
   administrator and users have access to public management tools, citizen
   services, and other urban planning resources.},

Abstract = {Sustainable development goal \#11 (SDG\#11) deals with making cities
   inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable. SDG\#3 deals with
   ``Strengthen the capacity of all countries, in particular developing
   countries, for early warning, risk reduction and management of national
   and global health risks{''} So, the COVID-19 pandemic can be included
   within the targets of SDG\#11 and \#3 targets. It is reiterated the
   necessity of disaster and emergency health risk reduction and the
   building of resilience within the context of sustainable development
   concerns. Resilience is a concept also contemplated within the paradigm
   of smart planning and smart cities. The urban domain is selected to
   explore the tools used to cope with the current COVID-19 pandemic and
   that contribute to building resilience. Innovation and the relevance of
   SDG\#9 are clear since the urgency of improvements in general and
   domestic technology and access to universal and affordable internet have
   to be guaranteed to achieve the objective of building resilience. A
   categorized vision of the main technologies, applications, and
   functionalities within the Smart City domain are discussed to identify
   the way those technologies support COVID-19 and integrate with the three
   SDGs fundamentals for resilience building. We hope that this work will
   contribute for practitioners, policymakers, academics, and citizens to
   be better prepared for future outbreaks.},

Abstract = {Tree fall is a major issue in large cities as it may obstruct roads and
   lead to traffic jams, and even injure people. Following these kind of
   incidents, monitoring the environment through sensors and Internet of
   Things technologies emerges as an important preventive approach. Another
   point is that the net primary productivity has a sensitive relation with
   trees characteristics including plant respiration and net photosynthesis
   which are highly sensitive to temperature. The health of the tree can
   then be monitored through leaf transpiration, sap flow measurement,
   environment evaluation as these methods offer indicators on any chance
   of a fall. The solution proposed in this paper includes an open-design
   hardware setup for monitoring trees in Smart Cities with Internet of
   Things. The setup is connected to a Smart City platform aiming to
   facilitate the use by other researchers and botanics, specially.
   Therefore, we noticed that the daily sensing data results in a huge
   amount of information that requires a balance between Big Data and Edge
   Computing approaches to process the whole collected data. The evaluation
   of the sensing data is presented together with the proposed
   architecture.},

Abstract = {IoT is rapidly progressing and gaining focus in the domain of smart
   cities. It copes with a lot of economy sectors by enabling to save
   resources efficiently, be human or material. Also, it allows creating
   simple applications to ease some tasks of people's daily lives. However,
   the development of IoT applications is not always a straightforward
   task, as sensors and actuators are not always readily usable.
   Furthermore, in scenarios where IoT devices can move unrestrictedly and
   are not continuously available, the dynamism can pose some challenges
   for developers. In this sense, the Internet of Mobile Things (IoMT) is
   an IoT instance where devices are mobile (i.e. not attached to fixed
   power supplies). To address this issue, we developed the ObsAct
   programming model. ObsAct is a layer built on top of the ContextNet IoMT
   middleware that allows programming reactive rule-based applications. In
   this paper, we will present use case scenarios where ObsAct is used to
   cope with the Smart Cities challenges. In addition, we show an
   evaluation of our solution and discuss its outcomes.},

Abstract = {About 6,000 years after the emergence of the first cities, humanity
   faces the challenges and consequences of the development of cities,
   which threaten the quality of life of people and the world environment.
   To date, more than half of world's population live in urban areas and,
   by 2050, one estimates that almost 70\% of them will live in cities.
   Thus, in order to avoid a total collapse, cities' urban planning must be
   rethought urgently by means of new planning and management models
   largely supported by robust digital technologies, innovations and a
   sustainable agenda. In this scenario, the concept of smart city emerges
   yet without a formal consensus. Smart city definitions have been derived
   from interdisciplinary concepts applied to cities most of them based on
   the management and heavy use of information and communication technology
   in cities. Thus, to allow a better comprehension of what is understood
   by smart city mainly under the perspective of emerging markets, this
   work seeks to identify what is the social representation of smart city
   amongst Brazilian citizens, comparing same to the extant literature on
   smart city definition.},

Abstract = {Smart cities are essential for modern urban development, offering
   numerous benefits. However, they also present significant cyber risks
   that require special attention. Mitigating these risks demands
   continuous efforts and innovative solutions. Since no solution can
   eliminate vulnerabilities, cyber insurance stands out as a protective
   mechanism against financial losses. Therefore, this study aims to
   highlight the relationship between cyber insurance and cyber risks in
   smart cities within the existing literature. To achieve this, a
   systematic literature review was conducted using the Scopus and Web of
   Science databases, selecting 38 articles for analysis. This study is the
   first review that links cyber insurance to smart cities, presenting
   findings that offer an overview of the main approaches used. Notable
   applications of cyber insurance include critical infrastructures,
   specific technological contexts, and strategies for cyber risk
   management and innovation. The research provides suggestions for further
   investigations and developments in the field.},

Abstract = {In this article, we present and analyze MUSANet, a hierarchical,
   distributed, context-aware architecture for collecting, processing, and

   related to monitoring and predicting bus arrivals in public

   results in different scenarios that point to the feasibility of our
   goal: a scalable architecture with a fast response time to traffic
   events. MUSANet is based on a three-tier architecture distributed over
   the cloud, fog, and edge, and supporting complex event processing (CEP)
   in all of them. Although the system is under development using the
   InterSCity platform in the cloud, the ContextNet middleware at the fog,
   and the Mobile-Hub platform at the edge, the MUSANet architecture can be
   deployed using other platforms, maintaining the concept of tiering
   responsibilities to minimize network bandwidth and delay, group

Abstract = {A publish-subscribe middleware is an application-independent
   infrastructure that supports implementing event-based systems, in which
   event generators (i. e., publishers) notify events to the infrastructure
   and event consumers (i. e., subscribers) subscribe to the infrastructure
   for receiving relevant notifications. Subscribers are not directly
   addressable by the publisher but are indirectly addressed according to
   the content of the events. This anonymity ensures that publishers and
   subscribers exchange information without knowing each other, which
   allows middleware to expand to a massive size on the scale of the
   Internet and Smart Cities. In this way, this article presents a study on
   publish-subscribe middlewares for the selective sending of events in
   Smart Cities. This selective notification delivery is important for some
   applications such as emergency services in Smart Cities, where only a
   subset of subscribers should receive the event and handle it as soon as
   possible.},

Abstract = {Since the transition from an agricultural to an industrial economy,
   cities have attracted large masses of people in search of their
   facilities. Cities are symbols of progress and opportunities. However,
   urbanization also brings with it several problems and challenges. Smart
   Cities (SC) offer a way to address these challenges by using technology
   to make cities more efficient, sustainable, and livable. There are
   numerous technologies that enable the concept of smart cities, including
   the Internet of Things (IoT). The IoT provides the fundamental sensing
   infrastructure that allows connecting and virtualizing the physical
   world, extracting environmental variables that serve as initial inputs
   for decision-making processes. Such processes are provided by software
   systems whose construction and execution need to deal with the dynamism,
   heterogeneity and often serendipitous nature that permeate both the
   domains of smart cities and IoT. As the integration of IoT and Smart
   Cities paradigms is still at an early stage, and there are not yet
   holistic solutions to explore the full potential of such a synergy, we
   carried out a literature review on the topic. In particular, the
   objective of this article is to describe the results of a structured
   literature review to identify general concepts about quality attributes,
   applications, technologies, and challenges of IoT solutions applied to
   the SC domain. Our main goal is to assist in understanding the basic
   concepts of the research area through the search for secondary studies.
   This review is a tertiary study covering 17 reviews and aims to promote
   a high-level discussion on the identified characteristics and provide an
   overview of the area to promote a better perception of current
   development needs and opportunities.},

Abstract = {The use of information technology is one way to help in solving urban
   problems, aiming for the development of smart cities. Crowdsensing
   mechanism is an important tool in this process, exploring a collective
   intelligence and organising a collaboration of large groups of people.
   This work focuses mainly on the process of management of crowdsensing
   campaigns contributing to the theoretical framework regarding the theme.
   Through a crowdsensing system, collaborative data collection and sensor
   monitoring campaigns were executed, which allowed learning about the
   management of crowdsensing campaigns, with results such as adjustments
   in the computational platform by the insertion of new types of campaigns
   and the inclusion of feedback elements. Collaborative data collection
   campaigns were carried out in a monitored way that enabled learning
   about crowdsensing campaigns management, resulting in significant
   contributions to the improvement of the system and propositions of
   adjustments in the theoretical framework of management campaign models.},

Abstract = {The smart cities concept arises from the necessity of managing several
   problems caused by the unbridled population growth at urban centers. To
   make a city become smart it is needed to employ Information and
   Communication Technologies (ICT) to access, process and deliver
   information according to the urban context. This information can be
   employed to mitigate several urban issues, such as traffic jams, high
   natural resource consumption, epidemias, sustainability, waste
   management, low quality and life expectancy of citizens, among others.
   Thus, the increasing need to create architectures that are able to
   interact with the Internet of Things, i.e., several built-in devices,
   appliances, sensors and actuators embedded in each urban context. This
   work is a systematic review regarding proposals for such architectures.
   After selecting the relevant approaches, we have identified a set of
   issues that these approaches aim to solve and some architectural
   patterns employed.},

Abstract = {The rapid urbanization process in the last century has deeply changed
   the way we live and interact with each other. As most people now live in
   urban areas, cities are experiencing growing demands for more efficient
   and sustainable public services that may improve the perceived quality
   of life, specially with the anticipated impacts of climatic changes. In
   this already complex scenario with increasingly overcrowded urban areas,
   different types of emergency situations may happen anywhere and anytime,
   with unpredictable costs in human lives and economic losses. In order to
   cope with unexpected and potentially dangerous emergencies, smart cities
   initiatives have been developed in different cities, addressing multiple
   aspects of emergencies detection, alerting, and mitigation. In this
   context, this article surveys recent smart city solutions for crisis
   management, proposing definitions for emergencies-oriented systems and
   classifying them according to the employed technologies and provided
   services. Additionally, recent developments in the domains of Internet
   of Things, Artificial Intelligence and Big Data are also highlighted
   when associated to the management of urban emergencies, potentially
   paving the way for new developments while classifying and organizing
   them according to different criteria. Finally, open research challenges
   will be identified, indicating promising trends and research directions
   for the coming years.},

   effort. Reo takes advantage of a formal logic-based framework which
   makes possible to reason, guarantee requirements, absence of described
   failures and provide certified software (i.e. proved-to-be-correct
   regarding the specification). This work is tailored to show how to use
   Reo to model Smart Cities software interaction compiling to an automated
   logic model able to guarantee the required constraints in a certified
   system.},

Abstract = {Smart city applications are inherently characterized by the integration
   of data from heterogeneous sources and the need of considering
   geographical information that represents the real-world urban space. To
   address these concerns, some platforms have been proposed in recent
   years offering common services and facilities to ease the development of
   smart city applications. Nonetheless, the existing platforms do not
   offer high-level interfaces to provide developers with proper tools that
   could reduce the complexity of developing applications, neither an
   interface to organize data visualization to end-users. Aiming at
   tackling such limitations, this work presents Web-based dashboards to
   support development and data visualization in smart city applications:
   the former is tailored to application developers, whereas the latter is
   suited to visualize data. This paper presents the use of these
   dashboards in association with a platform that integrates heterogeneous
   urban data with geographical information while supporting the
   development of smart city applications on top of this data.},

   applications, like smart surveillance using Internet of Things sensors
   demand the transmission of high amounts of traffic with strict quality
   of service, what may not be available at all times. One solution to deal
   with this traffic overload is to implement the concept of resources
   sharing. Considering this context, in this article, a heterogeneous
   network scenario is considered to implement a multi-purpose real time
   video surveillance application which can be applied to both smart cities
   and military surveillance such as borderline security. The proposed
   solution considers three crucial aspects: the QoS requirements of the
   real time video application; the cost-benefit of the spectrum
   allocation; and the time constraints involved in a vertical handover
   operation to avoid interference. The main contribution of the article
   are: (I) inclusion of a multilevel resources broker in the Smart Cities
   architecture, (II) a QoS-enabled solution for video surveillance to
   provide borderline security, and (III) a low overhead control mechanism
   to avoid interfering with the legitimate network traffic. Results
   obtained via simulations show that after the proposed solution is
   implemented delay and jitter are kept below their specific thresholds
   and therefore the QoS is guaranteed considering the coexistence of up to
   500 IoT sensors. Nearly 70\% of the traffic is accommodated either in
   IEEE 802.11 or IEEE 802.22 networks, which offer relatively low cost
   resources. These results are also compared with two state of the art
   related works and show that the proposed solution performs better than
   the related work in the analyzed scenarios. Finally, with respect to the
   time constraints, the implementation of the proposed solution leads to
   fast vertical handover, attaining times up to 46\% lower than the
   maximum allowed handover duration. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights

Abstract = {Internet of Things devices are responsible for collecting and
   transmitting data in smart cities, assisting smart cities to release
   greater potential. As Internet of Things devices are increasingly
   connected to smart cities, security and privacy have gradually become
   important issues. Recently, research works on mitigating security
   challenges of Internet of Things devices in smart cities mainly focused
   on authentication. However, in most of the existing authentication
   protocols, the trustworthiness evaluation of Internet of Things devices
   in smart cities is ignored. Considering the trustworthiness evaluation
   of Internet of Things devices is an important constituent of data source
   authentication, in this article, a cloud-aided trustworthiness
   evaluation mechanism is first designed to improve the credibility of the
   Internet of Things devices in smart cities. Furthermore, aiming at the
   problem that the user's privacy is easy to leak in the process of
   authentication, an anonymous authentication and key agreement scheme
   based on non-interactive zero knowledge argument is proposed. The
   proposed scheme can ensure the privacy preservation and data security of
   Internet of Things devices in smart cities. The security analysis
   demonstrates that the proposed scheme is secure under q-SDH problem. The
   experimental simulation indicates that the performance of the proposal
   is greatly improved compared with other similar schemes.},

Abstract = {Multi-channel cognitive radio ad hoc networks (CRAHNs) and
   information-centric networking (ICN) will be indispensable for enabling
   envisioned multimedia-based smart services within the umbrella of smart
   cities. Cognitive radios enable the efficient and opportunistic use of
   spectrum bands by using vacant licensed channels, whereas
   information-centric networking improves content distribution by
   decoupling producers and consumers. In this work, we discuss the design
   of information-centric cognitive radio-based networking for
   multimedia-based applications in smart cities. We examine the potential
   of the joint design of CRAHNs and ICN, and thoroughly review fundamental
   aspects and challenges of CR and ICN for smart cities. Subsequently, we
   qualitatively study the capability of information-centric cognitive
   radio-based networking for improving network connectivity, content
   search and distribution, reliability and confined delay in smart city
   safety and infotainment-based applications. Finally, we highlight future
   research directions for the design of protocols for this envisioned
   network that will support smart cities.},

Abstract = {One of the most critical issues in Smart Cities (SC) is how to use the
   energy system properly. The capacity to provide more detailed
   consumption information and more accurate consumer feedback is an
   essential step towards energy sustainability. On the end-user side, a
   system that supports the measurement of several points of consumption
   and provides visual information can help consumers reduce energy waste.
   On the other side, electric utilities can use a real-time measurement
   system to infer the energy consumption behavior, to find metering
   inconsistencies, to optimize the system, or to maintain the reliability
   of the supply system based on data information. This work presents a
   demand-side management Framework for smart cities which aims to provide
   integration between consumers and energy distribution utilities. This
   Framework can help the electricity demand control, presenting real-time
   consumption data and presenting relevant data on their consumption
   points to consumers. A prototype was developed as a proof of concept.},

Abstract = {Smart cities have become a reality around the world. They rely on
   wireless communication technologies, and they have provided many
   benefits to society, such as monitoring road traffic in real-time,
   giving continuous healthcare assistance to residents and managing the
   environment. This article revisits key interoperability questions in
   heterogeneous wireless networks for smart cities, and outlines a simple,
   modular architecture to deal with these complex issues. The architecture
   is composed by sensing, access network, Internet/cloud and application
   layers. Different features provided by the architecture, such as
   interoperability among technologies, low cost, reliability and security,
   have been evaluated through experiments and simulations under different
   scenarios. The QoS support and the seamless connectivity between pairs
   of heterogeneous technologies are proposed through a policy-based
   management (PBM) framework and MIH (Media Independent Handover).
   Moreover, an 802.11 mesh backbone composed of different types of mesh
   routers has been deployed for interconnecting the sensors and actuators
   to the Internet. Key results from experiments in the backbone are
   examined. They compare: (i) the performance of a single-path routing
   protocol (OLSR) with a multipath one (MP-OLSR); (ii) the monitoring
   delays from the proposed low cost sunspot/mesh and arduino/mesh
   gateways; and (iii) the authentication mechanisms employed. Significant
   results from simulations allow the analysis of the reliability on
   vehicular/mesh networks under jamming attacks by applying the OLSR and
   MP-OLSR routing protocols. Finally, this article provides an overview of
   open research questions. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Context: Smart cities are the future in terms of good resource and
   people management practices. Several resources can be managed by smart
   cities, among them urban mobility and energy consumption stand out.
   Problem: The brightness of public roads consume energy resources, but
   they are not always necessary, as is the case with roads with no use.
   Thus, energy resources are wasted. This work aimed to explore the
   economy of energy resources by observing the flow of use of public
   roads.
   Solution: Sensors observe the roads, and the costs of the edges are sent
   to the fog that applies a graph algorithm to determine the paths that
   have movement and, thus, generate the reductions in energy consumption
   via switching off lamps or reducing their frequency.
   Information System Theory: Based on the General Systems Theory, the
   general system is mapped into independent systems: fog sensors (fog) and
   algorithm execution nodes (nodes with higher processing power). A
   general ecosystem is formulated making the information system based on
   the information generated by the observation of the sensors.
   Method: A simulated environment was proposed to obtain the
   representation of a region of interest. For this region, a graph
   approach based on Dijkstra was applied to consider the paths with the
   highest flow of accesses and, thus, propose energy consumption
   reductions.
   Results Summary: The results obtained point to a possibility of saving
   energy resources in the range of 60 to 79\% depending on the type of
   lamps used, and the size of observed region. The results reinforce the
   need to explore intelligent resources for shared use resources
   management.
   Contributions and Impact in the IS area: Among the contributions to the
   area are: a manageable information system for public lighting. Use of
   fog for path management and energy matrix management. This work also
   contributes to proposing new approaches to the proposed problem, such as
   using the social context (via social networks) to define optimal paths.},

Title = {Deployment of a LoRaWAN network and evaluation of tracking devices in
   the context of smart cities},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNET SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2021},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Recent public cooperation between the Federal University of Technology -
   Parana (UTFPR) and the Toledo Municipality plans to implement the
   concept of smart cities in this city. In this context, one of the
   applications under development intends to track the recyclable garbage
   collector trucks in real time over the Internet. Actually, fleet vehicle
   tracking is one of the main applications for smart cities. LoRaWAN
   stands out among network technologies for smart cities due to operating
   in an open frequency range, covering long distances with low power
   consumption and low equipment cost. However, the coverage and
   performance of LoRaWAN is directly affected by both the environment and
   configuration parameters. In addition, tracking devices must be able to
   send its coordinates to the Internet even when the vehicle goes through
   zones where there are obstacles for electromagnetic waves such as
   elevated buildings or valleys. In this paper we perform experimental
   investigations to evaluate four LoRaWAN tracking devices, two available
   out of the box and two assembled and programmed. The behavior of each
   tracking device is analyzed when moving at a constant speed through
   three representative urban areas totaling 10.71 km(2). The two most
   efficient tracking devices are analyzed in a stretch of 3.5 km with
   speeds ranging from 0 to 30 km/h, 0 to 50 km/h and 0 to 100 km/h.
   Results include a quantitative and qualitative aspects, including the
   received signal strength indication (RSSI), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),
   packet delivery ratio (PDR), and spreading factor (SF) for the received
   geographic coordinates. As the devices depend on the quality of the
   signal offered by the network, we also present the results of the
   development and evaluation of the LoRaWAN network, by planning its

Abstract = {By using ICT in an innovative way, governments can improve the delivery
   of services and interaction with stakeholders. Open data is a way to
   help public organizations became more open and improve interaction with

   enhancements acquired on smart city environment that discloses open
   data. We propose a conceptual model to analyze the smart city
   initiative. We contextualized the model taking a smart city domain by
   analyzing three related-initiatives that comprises open data in a smart
   city case carried at Rio de Janeiro Operations Center (COR) in Brazil by
   seven deep-interviewees directly involved - from inside and outside - in
   this case. The findings reveal evidences that open data initiatives
   contribute to enhance the delivery of public value in smart city

Abstract = {Studies estimate that by 2050 two thirds of the world population will be
   leaving in urban areas, what leads to the necessity of intelligent
   services to meet the needs of the cities residents. An emerging solution
   to deal with this scenario is the convergence of information and
   communication technologies through the implementation of the concepts of
   smart cities and Internet of Things to provide solutions in diverse
   fields like infrastructure, transportation, and surveillance.
   Considering this challenging scenario, in this article a multilevel
   IoT-based smart cities infrastructure management architecture is
   proposed and the waste management problem is used as a case study to
   evaluate the performance of the proposed solution. Results proved the
   concept of the architecture, showing that it is able to manage up to
   3902 garbage bins simultaneously. These bins are able to correctly
   separate organic and recyclable waste in both indoor and outdoor
   scenarios, presenting low response times, what leads to a good quality
   of experience to the users of the system. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Nowadays, Blockchain has been widely used to store decentralized and
   secure transactions involving cryptocurrency, e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum,
   etc. However, Blockchain can also store other types of information
   besides monetary transactions. On the other hand, innovative solutions
   for smart cities are concerned with how services and information can be
   safely stored and shared. For this reason, smart city systems can
   benefit from using Blockchain to integrate their data and services.
   These smart solutions also demand consistency and standardization across
   the industry. However, this Blockchain integration varies according to
   its implementation. FIWARE, a framework of an open-source platform for
   smart solutions, adopts NGSI Standards (Context Information Management
   (CIM); NGSI-LD API: Tech. Rep., CIM and ETSI Industry Specification
   Group (ISG), 2020) to enable the integration of components and provides
   the basis for interoperability and portability among smart solutions.
   Unfortunately, FIWARE does not support any integration with Blockchain
   technology. Hence, this paper proposes a set of new components to allow
   FIWARE to be integrated with Blockchain technology. With these proposed
   components, it is possible to support Blockchain technology with smart
   city applications via the FIWARE platform. For instance, we have
   designed and implemented a FIWARE Blockchain adapter to submit/listen to
   transactions from/to FIWARE Context Broker to/from any Blockchain
   implementation without human intervention. In addition, we present a
   global post-pandemic vaccination case study to evaluate the proposed
   approach in the Smart City context.},

Abstract = {Big cities have noticeable problems resulting from poor management of
   urban services. Monitoring a city gives some parameters to evaluate the
   performance of urban services, allowing to identify their flaws, and
   elaborate strategic plains to correct them. Smart cities architectures
   are intended to propose Information and Communication Technologies
   (ICTs) solutions to increase service efectiveness. Considering that to
   establish a ICT infrastructure to support a smart city architecture is
   very expensive, once you have got the data and you know what urban
   service you will attend to, you can use a city simulator to test how the
   architecture will behave when facing the citys problems. In this context
   we propose the Synaptic City architecture, together with a city
   simulator, with which we modeled a Brazilian city, Recife, Pernambuco,

Abstract = {Event Notification Services (ENS) have an important role in the current
   context of Smart Cities. The publish-subscribe paradigm is a suitable
   approach to connect users and service providers. For many private and
   public services, including transport and emergency services, only some
   subscribers should receive event notifications. This paper proposes and
   investigates the performance of a new ENS framework which allows the
   sending of events to a subset of subscribers with the best conditions to
   handle it. The event model implemented by the ENS framework is derived
   from the publish-subscribe approach. It allows the best subscribers to
   receive the event based on a specific fitness function. An application
   of the ENS to the transport service is presented. The results show that
   when the best subscribers are chosen according to a specific desired
   metric, the travel time can be reduced or the best drivers can be
   selected. Therefore, this strategy can improve passengers' experience
   and optimize service performance.},

Abstract = {Natural resources management is essential, especially of water
   distribution within cities. In Brazil, water losses in distribution
   systems go up to around 38\%. In the context of ``Smart Cities{''},
   technologies that use ``The Internet of Things{''} can be applied to
   reduce such losses. The present article shows that leakages produce
   distinctive noise ranging from 100 Hz to 1000 Hz. Through digital signal
   processing techniques, such as the Discrete Fourier Transform and
   Goertzel Transform, the spectral signals are decomposed, revealing their
   components of frequency such as the intensity. An architecture that
   performs the communication between slave nodes through a TCP/IP network
   is then proposed. The slave nodes are responsible for data collection
   for leakage identification. The collected data is then sent to the data
   master where there is greater computing power. The data master will
   perform the processing according to the paradigm of edge computing, thus
   obtaining frequency responses and the identification of the leakage
   itself. It will also make data available through OPC-UA, a standard
   ``Internet of Things{''} communication protocol widely used in the
   industrial context.},

Abstract = {One of the key technologies in smart cities is the use of next
   generation networks such as 5G networks. Mainly because this new mobile
   technology offers massive connections in densely populated areas in
   smart cities, thus playing a crucial role for numerous subscribers
   anytime and anywhere. Indeed, all the most important infrastructure to
   promote a connected world is being related to next generation networks.
   Specifically, the small cells transmitters is one of the 5G technologies
   more relevant to provide more connections and to attend the high demand
   in smart cities. In this article, a smart small cell positioning is
   proposed in the context of a smart city. The work proposal aims to do
   this through the development of a hybrid clustering algorithm with
   meta-heuristic optimizations to serve users, with real data, of a region
   satisfying coverage criteria. Furthermore, the problem to be solved will
   be the best location of the small cells, with the minimization of
   attenuation between the base stations and its users. The possibilities
   of using multi-objective optimization algorithms based on bioinspired
   computing, such as Flower Pollination and Cuckoo Search, will be
   verified. It will also be analyzed by simulation which power values
   would allow the continuity of the service with emphasis on three 5G
   spectrums used around the world: 700 MHz, 2.3 GHz and 3.5 GHz.},

Abstract = {Context: Socioeconomic development has accelerated the urbanization
   process and the advance of Information and Communication Technologies
   (ICT). In this context, population growth in urban centers manifested
   challenges in the economic and cultural aspects of society. Issues such
   as mobility and sustainability come up. ICT plays an important role in
   this scenario, as it enables innovative services to citizens to improve
   their quality of life. Objective: To identify and analyze technological
   solutions (tools, services, applications or products) of urban public
   monitoring in order to characterize them, with respect to smart cities
   and ubiquitous devices, from the point of view of researchers and public
   agents in the field. context of theoretical and applied research in the
   literature. Method: A Systematic Literature Mapping (SLM) was performed
   to characterize the research in the area. Results: It was found that
   most studies treat as important and global trend urban public monitoring
   through ubiquitous devices in the context of smart cities. Conclusion:
   Urban public monitoring can be performed through appropriate ICT
   infrastructures, using devices such as sensors to capture and transmit
   data in real-time. This communication takes place without the use of
   wires and it is necessary to worry about the energy efficiency and
   accuracy of these ubiquitous devices. This way, the city can become more
   efficient and attractive to its citizens.},

Abstract = {Global competitiveness is the main reality for cities in the entire
   globe. City rankings may bring to cities their reality in comparison to
   others, which can lead to some positive effects. However, one city
   should be compared to similar ones. In a previous work, we proposed a
   method based on financial indicators and clustering, aiming to turn
   possible to compare similar cities from financial perspective, due to
   its importance in the reality of a city. This work aims to present a
   literature review on the use of financial and economic indicators in
   smart city context. We used a method to construct a bibliometry on this
   theme, which is present in this work, as well as the obtained results.
   Hereafter, we present the main works related to our theme, and we finish
   our work presenting the list of most important financial and economic

   chosen to present a view of the modeling in archimate language. Five
   enterprise architecture implementation methodologies were reviewed.
   Eleven axes were recognized and compared with other methodologies to
   evaluate the maturity level of city governance. This led to a
   questionnaire of diagnostic assessment to identify the maturity level in
   city councils. This method generated the score of each axis, which
   allowed visualization of the maturity model of council governance. The
   results showed that the organizations diagnosed in relation to the
   eleven defined axes are between 11.43\% and 58.22\%, with the objective
   of reaching 100\% for a high-performance rate in relation to the
   enterprise architecture.},

Abstract = {As a result of rural and suburban migration to the cities, urban life
   has become a significant challenge for citizens and, particularly, for
   city administrators who must manage the sustainable use of resources
   such as energy, water, and transportation. Smart cities are the biggest
   vision to efficiently address these challenges through a real-time
   monitoring, providing an intelligent planning and a sustainable urban
   development. However, to accomplish them we need a tightly integration
   among citizens, city devices, city administrators, and the data center
   platform where all data is stored, combined, and processed. In this
   context, we propose ElCity, a model that combines citizens and city
   devices data to enable an elastic multilevel management of energy
   consumption for a particular city. As design decision, this management
   must occur automatically without affecting the quality of already
   offered services. The main contribution of ElCity model concerns the
   exploration of the cloud elasticity concept in multiple target levels
   (smartphones from citizens, city devices involved in the public
   lightning, and data center nodes), turning on or off the resources on
   each level in accordance with their demands. In this way, this article
   presents the ElCity architecture, detailing its modules distributed
   along the three data sources, in addition to an experiment that uses
   city devices and citizens data from Rome to explore energy saving. The
   results are promising, with an Energy Monitor module that allows the
   estimation of the energy consumption of elastic applications based on
   CPU and memory traces with an average and median precision of 97.15 and
   97.72 percent. Moreover, we proposed a reduction of more than 90 percent
   in the energy spent in public lightning in the city of Rome which was
   obtained thanks to an analysis of geolocation data from their citizens.},

   networks. Proposals such as narrowband are promising, however, there is
   not as much coverage into big centers as 2G technology has. This work
   proposes the development of a solution to monitor smart containers,

Abstract = {The growth of smart city applications is increasingly around the world,
   many cities invest in the development of these systems intending to
   improve the management and life of their residents. This increase is
   mainly due to the emergence of new technologies such as Big Data and
   Internet of Things (IoT). Some of the biggest challenges in applying
   these systems, relate to the processing, visualization, and analysis of
   the generated data, since most systems tend to work connected, thus
   generating a large mass of data that deviates from the standard of
   previously used systems. For data visualization, one of the main devices
   used is the reduction of dimensionality, in an attempt to bring data
   from one dimension N to two or three dimensions and thus be noticeable
   to human eyes. There are several algorithms used for dimensionality
   reduction, the linear ones that as the name implies, solve linearly
   separable problems and so these are very limited and the nonlinear ones,
   that solve more complex problems, but usually have an excessive runtime,
   making them or often inappropriate to apply. This article presents the
   parallel implementation of the nonlinear dimension reduction algorithm
   t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), showing better
   results than its conventional version in terms of runtime, thus showing
   that parallelism can make the problem of dimensionality reduction
   treatable, bringing greater scalability and delivering results within an
   acceptable time frame.},

Abstract = {The significant evolution of the Internet of Things (IoT) enabled the
   development of numerous devices able to improve many aspects in various
   fields in the industry for smart cities where machines have replaced
   humans. With the reduction in manual work and the adoption of
   automation, cities are getting more efficient and smarter. However, this
   evolution also made data even more sensitive, especially in the
   industrial segment. The latter has caught the attention of many hackers
   targeting Industrial IoT (IIoT) devices or networks, hence the number of
   malicious software, i.e., malware, has increased as well. In this
   article, we present the IIoT concept and applications for smart cities,
   besides also presenting the security challenges faced by this emerging
   area. We survey currently available deep learning (DL) techniques for
   IIoT in smart cities, mainly deep reinforcement learning, recurrent
   neural networks, and convolutional neural networks, and highlight the
   advantages and disadvantages of security-related methods. We also
   present insights, open issues, and future trends applying DL techniques
   to enhance IIoT security.},

Abstract = {The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its innumerous
   applications for Smart Cities emphasizes the need for context-aware
   systems able to adapt behavior automatically to instant environment
   conditions. Currently, there is a gap in terms of understanding how
   context information is interrelated, as well as tracking which events
   occurred under which conditions within certain context scopes.
   Visualizing, specifying, tracking and monitoring typical contexts
   involved in IoT-based applications are still challenging activities
   since context modeling remains a low level process that requires much
   human expertise. In this paper we propose a new context life cycle that
   involves context design and context tracking. We developed a
   context-aware management framework, where contexts are modeled as graphs
   and can be explicitly designed and their occurrences can be tracked
   down. We believe that this feature of designing and tracking context
   graphs may help developers, administrators, and end-users in harnessing
   the wealth of information generated by highly scalable IoT systems.},

Title = {A centralized platform of open government data as support to
   applications in the smart cities context},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WEB INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {14},

Pages = {2-28},
Abstract = {Purpose The development of smart cities (SCs) is a costly process as it
   requires the implementation of physical infrastructure to meet the
   demand for data collection. On the other hand, there are open government
   data (OGD) that are open and free, and can be a first step from the
   current city evolution to SCs at a more affordable cost. However, these
   data are available in a decentralized way, in different formats and
   granularities. To date, the authors have not found any literature work
   that performs the centralization of OGDs on a single platform. The
   purpose of this paper is provide a centralized OGD platform.
   Design/methodology/approach This work investigates the state-of-the-art
   literature from the OGD, establishes the research question, design and
   develop the platform for OGD and accomplish the validation of the
   platform.
   Findings Through the validations of the platform, advantages were
   observed in relation to productivity gain for the development of
   solutions, in the SC context, using the proposed platform.
   Research limitations/implications The data have been collected in a
   manual way but for future works, the authors will use the web-crawler
   for the collection of data.
   Practical implications One town hall (Sorocaba) is interested in using
   the platform to analyze the data usage in the simple way and compare
   with the other nearby towns.
   Originality/value It is a recent work in literature using OGD, and there
   is no work that centralizes the information about several town halls to
   provide comparison between them and improve the decision-making.},

Abstract = {In the Smart Cities context, a plethora of Middle ware Platforms had
   been proposed to support applications execution and data processing.
   Despite all the progress already made, the vast majority of solutions
   have not met the requirements of Applications' Runtime, Development, and
   Deployment when related to Scalability. Some studies point out that just
   1 of 97 (1\%) reported platforms reach this all this set of requirements
   at same time. This small number of platforms may be explained by some
   reasons: i) Big Data: The huge amount of processed and stored data with
   various data sources and data types, ii) Multi domains: many domains
   involved (Economy, Traffic, Health, Security, Agronomy, etc.), iii)
   Multiple processing methods like Data Flow, Batch Processing, Services,
   and Microservices, and 4) High Distributed Degree: The use of multiple
   IoT and BigData tools combined with execution at various computational
   levels (Edge, Fog, Cloud) leads applications to present a high level of
   distribution. Aware of those great challenges, we propose Sapparchi, an
   integrated architectural model for Smart Cities applications that
   defines multi-processing levels (Edge, Fog, and Cloud). Also, it
   presents the Sapparchi middleware platform for developing, deploying,
   and running applications in the smart city environment with an osmotic
   multi-processing approach that scales applications from Cloud to Edge.
   Finally, an experimental evaluation exposes the main advantages of
   adopting Sapparchi.},

Abstract = {Facing uncertainty catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the
   decision-making of information and communication technology (ICT)
   managers in smart cities has become essential for technological
   development. This exploratory study describes the effects of ICT
   governance practices and the use of Industry 4.0 technologies on the
   decision-making of technology managers in Brazilian cities considered
   smart in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, 39
   municipalities were selected based on classifications of Brazilian smart
   cities, and data were collected through the electronic citizen service
   system and a survey application. It identified the use of the
   Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) and the ICT Master
   Plan (PDTIC) as the cities' ICT governance practices. Regarding Industry
   4.0 technologies, the use of business intelligence (BI), cloud computing
   (CC), and open data was verified. Furthermore, the need to develop a
   planning culture and the need for internal training of professionals in
   the face of new technological resources emerged. The results showed that
   ICT governance practices and Industry 4.0 technologies have positive
   effects if used holistically according to the alignment with the
   municipality's strategic objectives. The senior management of
   municipalities must see the importance of making constant investments in
   infrastructure and the technical capacity of professionals to achieve
   greater effectiveness in the use of technological resources.},

Title = {Integrating Data Privacy and Energy Management in Smart Cities With
   Partial Sustainable IoT Networks},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {33176-33188},
Abstract = {IoT networks are transitioning towards greener underlying technologies.
   In smart cities environments, while some devices are already sustainable
   with rechargeable batteries and energy harvesting hardware, many still
   rely on traditional non-sustainable components. This partial sustainable
   Internet of Things (IoT) network poses a research challenge, since the
   profile of sustainable nodes aims for neutral or self-powered operation,
   which may conflict with the energy-saving goals of traditional
   non-sustainable nodes. In this challenging scenario, it is essential to
   share Energy Information (EI), i.e. battery state-of-charge, among the
   nodes to efficiently manage energy resources. However, EI sharing is
   valuable data for attackers to perform energy-based attacks, exploiting
   the most vulnerable nodes in smart cities. To tackle these problems,
   this article presents the Dual Energy PROfile for interNet-of-thiNgs
   with Enhanced Security (DEPRONN-ES), which is a solution designed to
   support partially sustainable networks, i.e. traditional and sustainable
   nodes, and applies differential privacy to enhance data privacy levels
   of the EI sharing. The performed evaluation shows the proposed solution
   is able to reduce the success rate of attacks in 87\% and its
   effectiveness in terms of consumed resources of the attacked node.
   Besides, DEPRONN-ES is able to support conflicting profiles to operate
   in distinct energy consumption levels. This framework utilized emulation
   of IoT devices and real data traces of indoor light intensity
   measurements provided by Columbia University as a harvesting source of
   the rechargeable batteries of sustainable nodes.},

Title = {Collecting Sensed Data with Opportunistic Networks: The Case of Contact
   Information Overhead},
Journal = {INFORMATION},
Year = {2017},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {The rising human population in urban environments drives the mission
   towards smart cities, which envisions a wide deployment of sensors in
   order to improve the quality of living. In this regard, opportunistic
   networks (OppNets) present an economical means of collecting delay
   tolerant data from sensors to their respective gateways for providing
   various Smart City services. Due to the distributed nature of the
   network, encounter-based routing protocols achieve acceptable throughput
   by requiring nodes to exchange and update contact information on an
   encounter basis. Unfortunately, sufficient insight into the associated
   overhead is lacking in the literature. Hence, we contribute by modelling
   contact information overhead and investigating its impact on OppNet
   routing, particularly in terms of data exchange success and energy
   consumption on portable handheld devices. Our findings reveal that the
   expected contact information overhead in Smart City scenarios
   significantly reduces data exchange success and increases energy
   consumption on portable handheld devices, thereby threatening the
   feasibility of the technology. We address this issue by proposing an
   algorithm that can be incorporated into encounter-based routing
   protocols to reduce contact information overhead without compromising
   throughput. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm reduces
   the average contact information overhead, increases throughput and
   reduces average energy consumption.},

Abstract = {Smart Cities theme has evolved in the last years, leading the cities to
   implement initiatives related to technical aspects to improve quality of
   life. Another focus on this theme is how to measure the added value of
   these initiatives to the population. The Brazilian Network of Smart and
   Human Cities (RBCIH) was created in order to join both approaches in
   Brazil, putting together members from academy, private initiative and
   local (municipality) government. Nowadays, RBCIH is composed by 350
   Brazilian cities (in a universe of 5570 cities), indicating that a
   long-term work has to be executed by RBCIH in Brazil. Two purposes of
   RBCIH are presenting good practices and evaluating how smart and human a
   city is. In this work, a methodology is presented for constructing a
   Brazilian reference model and an evaluation method for smart cities,

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a transformative technology that
   allows interconnected devices to exchange data over the Internet,
   enabling automation and real-time decision making in a variety of areas.
   A key aspect of the success of the IoT lies in its integration with
   low-resource hardware, such as low-cost microprocessors and
   microcontrollers. These devices, which are affordable and energy
   efficient, are capable of handling basic tasks such as sensing,
   processing, and data transmission. Their low cost makes them ideal for
   IoT applications in low-income communities where the government is often
   absent. This review aims to present some applications-such as a flood
   detection system; a monitoring system for analog and digital sensors; an
   air quality measurement system; a mesh video network for community
   surveillance; and a real-time fleet management system-that use low-cost
   hardware such as ESP32, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino, and the MQTT protocol
   used to implement low-cost monitoring systems applied to improve the
   quality of life of people in small cities or communities.},

Abstract = {The recent political, economic, and social situation has given rise to
   question on the part of citizens regarding their own space for political
   participation. Social movements in the form of protests are an example
   of this growing need for society's participation. One thing that can
   expand these possibilities is technology. It is correct to affirm that
   the advancement of smart city and popularization of technology - more
   specifically, of social media - has established new opportunities to
   expand these virtual spaces. In line with this scenario, there are
   several initiatives whose objective is to develop tools that facilitate
   or promote citizen participation. However, there are still many issues
   that need to be investigated in order for the use of these tools to be
   effective. The objective of this work was to propose a tool that
   facilitates the discussion of societal problems by citizens. In the
   analysis of the results - obtained through an experiment with users to
   evaluate the effectiveness of the tool - it could be seen that, although
   the majority of users agreed that the discussion model and the proposed
   problem register can contribute to the real solution of the problem, it
   could also be seen that citizens still lack motivation and engagement -
   something that needs to be studied and improved.},

Abstract = {The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices demands robust
   structures for processing and storing trillion gigabytes of data. Part
   of those data can be used for evaluating the solution's effectiveness
   and to improve it. Hence, a reliability analysis based on the solution's
   produced data is important to validate it and find weaknesses to solve.
   Therefore, in this paper we process the data generated by a sensor-based
   smart parking system to present a reliability analysis. This system is
   implemented placing ultrasonic sensors, a web service, the FIWARE
   platform, and a mobile application to Android devices, in a three-layer
   architecture. We evaluate how many errors occur in a certain time
   window, the success and error rates and the most common kind of error
   produced. Finally, we conclude that even with some instability our
   sensing approach is effective with a worst case success rate greater
   than 96\%. Moreover, we find out that our system works in an open
   environment with tropical climate conditions.},

Abstract = {Recent advances in sensor-equipped smartphones are opening brand new
   opportunities, such as automatically extracting Points Of Interest
   (POIs) and mobility habits of citizens in Smart Cities from the large
   amount of harvested data hotspots. At the same time, the high dynamicity
   and unpredictability of Smart Cities crowds, opportunistically
   collaborating toward these common crowdsensing tasks, introduces
   challenging issues due to the need for fast and continuous processing of
   these Big Data Streams in the backend of next generation crowdsensing
   platforms. This paper presents our practical experiences and lessons
   learnt in deploying the ParticipAct platform and living lab, an ongoing
   experiment at University of Bologna that involves 300 students for one
   year. Among all management issues addressed in ParticipAct, this article
   shows the integration of MongoDB in the ParticipAct backend, as a
   powerful NoSQL storage and processing engine to fasten the
   identification of POIs; the reported performance results confirm the
   feasibility of the approach by quantifying its advantages for city
   managers.},

Abstract = {Urban growth adversely affects accesses to public spaces and to their
   physical and functional structures. Simple tasks become a challenge for
   visually impaired individuals either because of the difficulty getting
   reliable non-visual information from the surrounding space or the lack
   of information. In Smart Cities scenarios, important investments will be
   directed to urban accessibility, but nowadays people with sensory
   disabilities still have to face mobility problems in those spaces.
   Therefore, designing suitable solutions to provide more information
   about urban spaces is extremely important and requires user
   participation. This context motivated the development of the Electronic
   Long Cane project. The project enhances the features of traditional long
   canes to detect obstacles located above the waist. Nowadays, the
   electronic cane was redesigned including new functions based on the
   Internet of Things. As a result, evidences of User-Centric Design have
   emerged, increasing the probability of success of this technology in
   Smart Cities context.},

Abstract = {Edge computing takes computation away from the Cloud closer to the
   physical world. Therefore, it reduces the cost of communication
   bandwidth between IoT devices and the Cloud. However, Edge computing
   imposes certain limitations in computation power because due to poor
   hardware capacity of the devices. This restriction may significantly
   affect the performance of the deployed applications, especially Smart
   City applications. This limitations also could be aggravated by
   unpredictable human behaviors wich will easily make the Edge computation
   node overloaded. Osmotic computing is a new IoT application programming
   paradigm that provides an opportunity to balance the workload between
   Edge and Cloud therefore to overcome the load imbalance problem of Smart
   City applications. To this end, we propose an Osmotic Execution
   Framework that leverages state-of-the-art microservices techniques to
   deploy and execute a Smart City application in a distributed environment
   including Edge and Cloud. Finally, we evaluate load balancing through
   latency time analysis of our framework with a real-world smart parking
   application.},

Abstract = {Historically, cities follow reactive planning models where managers make
   decisions as problems occur. On the other hand, the exponential growth
   of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has allowed the
   connection of a diverse array of sensors, devices, systems, and objects.
   These objects can then generate data that can be transformed into
   information and used in a more efficient urban planning paradigm, one
   that allows decisions to be made before the occurrence of problems and
   emergencies. Therefore, this article aims to propose a platform capable
   of estimating the amount of carbon dioxide based on sensor readings in
   vehicles, indirectly contributing to a more proactive city planning
   based on the monitoring of vehicular pollution. Crowdsensing techniques
   and an On-Board Diagnostic (OBD-II) reader are used to extract data from
   vehicles in real time, which are then stored locally on the devices used
   to perform data collection. With the performed experiments, it was
   possible to extract information about the operation of the vehicles and
   their dynamics when moving in a city, providing valuable information
   that can support auxiliary tools for the management of urban centers.},

   have become an essential source for smart cities planning. Given this

   through different metrics, allowing comparisons between different
   mobility traces in a simplified way. Furthermore, MobVis can extract and
   visualize spatial, temporal, and social aspects of mobility data through
   a Web interface. MobVis architecture has five main components: input
   data; data preparation; data processing and analysis to extract mobility
   metrics; visualization; and a web interface. To demonstrate the
   framework's process, we created a use case analyzing the characteristics
   of two distinct traces (Taxi and IoT-Objects). Then, through different
   metrics, we evaluated the data in two aspects: i) descriptive, through a
   set of graphics and quantitative data that enables characterizing each
   trace; and ii) comparative, presenting the main differences between the
   traces.},

Abstract = {In smart city scenarios, the huge proliferation of monitoring cameras
   scattered in public spaces has posed many challenges to network and
   processing infrastructure. A few dozen cameras are enough to saturate
   the city's backbone. In addition, most smart city applications require a
   real-time response from the system in charge of processing such
   large-scale video streams. Finding a missing person using facial
   recognition technology is one of these applications that require
   immediate action on the place where that person is. In this paper, we
   tackle these challenges presenting a distributed system for video
   analytics designed to leverage edge computing capabilities. Our approach
   encompasses architecture, methods, and algorithms for: (i) dividing the
   burdensome processing of large-scale video streams into various machine
   learning tasks; and (ii) deploying these tasks as a workflow of data
   processing in edge devices equipped with hardware accelerators for
   neural networks. We also propose the reuse of nodes running tasks shared
   by multiple applications, e.g., facial recognition, thus improving the
   system's processing throughput. Simulations showed that, with our
   algorithm to distribute the workload, the time to process a workflow is
   about 33\% faster than a naive approach.},

   vehicles are employed for surveillance and management of road traffic,
   navigation assistance, etc., by inheriting different analytical and
   communication techniques. With the Social Internet of Things (SIoT),
   interogrowthperable and shared computing models are adopted by the
   connected vehicles to perform application-specific decisions. By
   considering the need for computation models in smart connected vehicle
   networks, this article introduces a shared adaptive computing model
   (SACM) for improving the reliability of vehicle control and traffic
   management. This computing model considers multiple features of the
   in-range vehicles in detecting traffic and providing guided solutions
   for reliable routing in a smart city environment. This computing model
   is aided by the conditional support vector machine (SVM) for
   differentiating the complexity of multiflow data processing from the
   neighboring vehicles. The physical and connectivity-based factors from
   the smart vehicle using SVM classification learning improve the decision
   reliability and reduce the computing time and complexity.},

Abstract = {People use smart transportation systems to move around in smart cities,
   producing a massive amount of valuable mobility data. Although this
   characteristic enables the development of many intelligent applications,
   it can expose users to privacy threats. Location privacy is an issue
   addressed in many mobility contexts, in which there is a privacy
   concern. Currently, there are some proposals to tackle this problem, and
   some questions naturally arise: Are these proposals suitable for a
   dynamic environment, such as smart mobility? What are the impacts of
   mobility on privacy? In this article, we answer these questions to
   explore location privacy in smart mobility considering open and online
   data, one of the fundamental pillars of smart city platforms. We have
   evidenced the hypothesis that mobility can impact privacy approaches of
   anonymization (mix zones) and obfuscation (GEO-I) in the context of
   smart mobility. For this, we performed experiments to characterize and
   find similarities in the statistical distributions extracted from two
   stay points metrics, which operate as substrates to build location
   privacy protection mechanisms. We use an accuracy metric to quantify the
   datasets' distributions that matched each other. We conducted a
   comprehensive evaluation of seven real datasets of mono or multimodal
   mobility. The results showed that the stay point count metric reached
   100\% and 83.3\% accuracy for coarse-grained (person and vehicle) and
   fine-grained (bus, taxi, and person) data. Additionally, we show a
   similarity between distributions for the same vehicle type for mono and
   multimodal datasets. Results suggest that privacy has a high dependence
   on mobility in different granularity levels.},

   proposal, we carried out a usability assessment following the ISO 9241,
   which covers ergonomics of human-computer interaction. For such, this
   paper describes a case study using Crow4City in a 3-stage evaluation,
   involving human volunteers, pre-defined tasks, survey analysis and
   conformity analysis. The statistical indicators show the usability
   levels which are useful in the analysis of the user's challenge and
   motivation on using such a system.},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The role of transport in sustainable development was first recognized at
   the 1992 United Nations (UN) Earth Summit and reinforced in its outcome
   document-Agenda 21. It is also part of objective 11 of UN 2030 Agenda
   for Sustainable Development. The improvements in the traditional methods
   of transportation lag behind the necessities. This paper shows that
   Magnetic Levitation (MagLev) can fulfill the demand and fits with smart
   grid concepts. Moreover, the levitation method based on the diamagnetic
   property of high-temperature superconductors in the proximity of
   rare-earth permanent magnets presents advantages in comparison with
   other levitation methods. This technological solution was tested with
   the operation of a real scale prototype inside the campus of the Federal
   University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRJ), operating since 2014. The paper
   presents a historical and technological overview of the steps necessary
   to turn this prototype into a commercial product. The development is
   framed within NASA's Technological Readiness Levels (TRL). A new
   transportation paradigm is on the verge of becoming a reality.},

Abstract = {The urban, social, industrial and technological evolution in recent
   years has forced designers, entrepreneurs and public entities to rethink
   the conceptual and operational logic for the construction of new urban
   settlements, according to the authentic principles of mutual respect
   between man and nature, eliminating all thought extremism and purely
   conceptual theories. In order to make their respective professional and
   life skills available to future generations, we have set up two
   international working groups, the ISCW and IS.Smart, in collaboration
   with the UFC universities of Fortaleza (Brazil), UIR of Rabat (Morocco)
   and UNITO of Turin (Italy), which for some years now, have been working
   to transform the notions of smart cities and smart buildings, combined
   with the new industrial revolution 4.0 and tokenomics, into concrete,
   multidisciplinary and educational activities. This publication, the
   result of the work developed in the last three years, intends to be an
   easy-to-read and application tool for all operators who wish to approach
   the ``smart world{''} in a professional manner, especially in situations
   with serious housing shortage and still in the process of social and
   economic development. By reporting experiences and methodologies already
   field tested by the author in some working circumstances and that have
   given rise to case studies, similar to the ``Polo Multimodal Pecem{''}
   (Brazil), the reader will find useful insights such as the definition of
   the smart concept and ``smart{''} objectives, the approach to the
   project, the definition of evaluation parameters, operational examples
   of management, capital raising and crowdfunding, tokenomics and economy.
   I do believe that the future of the city will be increasingly linked to
   these issues, which have now become fundamental and necessary in the
   projection and planning processes of urban settlements.},

   minimizing these impacts are pricey and do not happen immediately. Thus,
   in order to improve vehicular traffic flow in dense urban centers, we
   present REACT, a traffic management system to minimize vehicle
   congestion in Smart Cities. REACT is a traffic management system based
   on Vehicular communication, and it is divided into Request and Response
   phases. The Request phase allows vehicles to request traffic information
   from neighbor road segments. The Response supports vehicles to respond
   to the request with current road traffic information. The performance
   evaluation shows the ability of our solution to reduce traffic jams with
   a low communication overhead.},

Title = {Surveillance System in Smart Cities: A Dependability Evaluation Based on

Abstract = {Surveillance monitoring systems are highly necessary, aiming to prevent
   many social problems in smart cities. The internet of things (IoT)
   nowadays offers a variety of technologies to capture and process massive
   and heterogeneous data. Due to the fact that (i) advanced analyses of
   video streams are performed on powerful recording devices; while (ii)
   surveillance monitoring services require high availability levels in the
   way that the service must remain connected, for example, to a connection
   network that offers higher speed than conventional connections; and that
   (iii) the trust-worthy dependability of a surveillance system depends on
   various factors, it is not easy to identify which components/devices in
   a system architecture have the most impact on the dependability for a
   specific surveillance system in smart cities. In this paper, we
   developed stochastic Petri net models for a surveillance monitoring
   system with regard to varying several parameters to obtain the highest
   dependability. Two main metrics of interest in the dependability of a
   surveillance system including reliability and availability were analyzed
   in a comprehensive manner. The analysis results show that the variation
   in the number of long-term evolution (LTE)-based stations contributes to
   a number of nines (\#9s) increase in availability. The obtained results
   show that the variation of the mean time to failure (MTTF) of
   surveillance cameras exposes a high impact on the reliability of the
   system. The findings of this work have the potential of assisting system
   architects in planning more optimized systems in this field based on the
   proposed models.},

Title = {Enhancing intelligence in traffic management systems to aid in vehicle
   traffic congestion problems in smart cities},
Journal = {AD HOC NETWORKS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {107},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {One of the main challenges in urban development faced by large cities is
   related to traffic jam. Despite increasing effort s to maximize the
   vehicle flow in large cities, to provide greater accuracy to estimate
   the traffic jam and to maximize the flow of vehicles in the transport
   infrastructure, without increasing the overhead of information on the
   control-related network, still consist in issues to be investigated.
   Therefore, using artificial intelligence method, we propose a solution
   of inter-vehicle communication for estimating the congestion level to
   maximize the vehicle traffic flow in the transport system, called
   TRAFFIC. For this, we modeled an ensemble of classifiers to estimate the
   congestion level using TRAFFIC. Hence, the ensemble classification is
   used as an input to the proposed dissemination mechanism, through which
   information is propagated between the vehicles. By comparing TRAFFIC
   with other studies in the literature, our solution has advanced the
   state of the art with new contributions as follows: (i) increase in the
   success rate for estimating the traffic congestion level; (ii) reduction
   in travel time, fuel consumption and CO2 emission of the vehicle; and
   (iii) high coverage rate with higher propagation of the message,
   maintaining a low packet transmission rate. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {This paper proposes the adoption of a more pragmatic approach to urban
   sensing to leverage the initial offering of open databases within the
   context of smart cities. In this sense, the use of mobility agents
   already available to provide mobility to traditional sensors can enable
   a preliminary instrumentation of cities more quickly and possibly at a
   lower cost. As proof of concept, we investigated the use of metropolitan
   bus equipped with sensors such as urban data collectors. We believe that
   this strategy can help overcoming many challenges of traditional
   approaches for instrumentation of cities, such as power supply,
   maintenance, operation, and protection of a large amount of static
   sensors. To assess the feasibility of sampling by collectors, we
   conducted experiments comparing averages using frequent readings vs
   averages using intermittent readings collected by sensors of a
   climatological micro station.},

Abstract = {When approaching topics related to Information Security, the trending
   comments relays on Privacy (or Confidentiality), Integrity and
   Availability. However there are scenarios that overpass these 3
   concepts. Security in Depth is a kind of issue that according to its
   concept could generate problems and situations for any type of solution,
   in different aspects. Following this idea, cities and citizens are
   depositing more and more responsibilities in urban systems, in order to
   provide and obtain more efficient services, even more, to put such
   responsibility in those systems are becoming vital to cities evolution.
   Within this scenario, this works proposed to present security issues
   that affects city systems and how those issues may impact Privacy,

Abstract = {New information and communication technologies enable a better

   tools to analyze data for better decisions, anticipate problems and
   resolve them proactively. In this context, this article proposes a
   simulation tool to analyze the interaction of typical cities occurrences
   like criminal and police. The information of both occurrences, including
   their densities, are inserted and visualized on a city map. Each record
   is marked on the GPS point where it happened. From these inputs data,
   the interactions are modeled by Voronoi Diagrams. The occurrences change
   their position according to the size area of the opposite event. In this
   way, crimes runway from police and police catch crimes occurrences. As
   results, we show that a large increase of police actions will not
   influence quantitatively in the reduction of criminal occurrences out of

Abstract = {Smart cities can be seen as large-scale Cyber-Physical Systems with
   sensors monitoring cyber and physical indicators and with actuators
   dynamically changing the complex urban environment in some way. In this
   context, urban sensing is a new paradigm that exploits human-carried or
   vehicle-mounted sensors to ubiquitously collect data to provide a
   holistic view of the city. A challenge in this scenario is the
   transmission of sensed data in situations where the networking
   infrastructure is intermittent or unavailable. This paper outlines our
   research into an engine that uses opportunistic networks to support the
   data transmission of urban sensing applications. It applies situation
   awareness and computational intelligence approaches to perform routing,
   adaptation, and decision-making procedures. We carried out simulations
   within a simulated environment that showed our engine had 12\% less
   overhead than other compared approaches. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All

Abstract = {Social networks have become an important channel for exchanging
   information and communication among citizens. Text mining, crowdsourcing
   and data visualization are some approaches that allow the information
   and knowledge extraction from texts in comment formats, exchanged
   between citizens in social networks. This movement can be indirectly
   used as a bias for popular participation, gaining prominence in the
   construction of smart cities. The objective of this work is to present a
   method that geocodes citizens' comments made on posts in Social Network
   Pages of Local Government Agencies, and extracts the most frequent
   topics present in these comments. In order to validate our method, we
   implemented a web system that implements the steps of the proposed
   method, and conducted a case study. The tool, and consequently the steps
   of the presented method, was evaluated by four software developers,
   which indicated that the tool was easy to use, new knowledge could be
   extracted from it, and some interesting improvements were pointed out by
   them.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, many cities around the world adopted different definitions of
   Smart Cities. Many organizations proposed collections of indicators for
   evaluating how smart the cities are. One problem related to applying
   these indicators is how to compare fairly the cities, considering that
   they are quite different in some countries or regions, like in Brazil.
   Therefore, grouping similar cities should be interesting, though there
   are different methods for grouping them. This work proposes a method for
   grouping cities based on their financial features, supported by
   clustering and regression techniques. This work also present an
   evaluation of the proposed method using real data from cities located in
   Rio de Janeiro state in Brazil. The results show the feasibility of the
   method, although obtaining the specifically type of used data is yet a
   challenge.(1)},

Abstract = {The usage of 5G-enabled IoT devices is rising exponentially as humans
   tend to shift towards a more automated lifestyle. A significant amount
   of IoT devices is expected to join the network as IoT has allowed
   interconnection and transmission among global devices which has resulted
   in generation of enormous diverse data. There is a requirement for a
   real-time, latency-specific, and network efficient computing paradigm in
   5G-enabled smart city infrastructure. Fog computing presents trustworthy
   solutions to tackle these issues by combining edge users. They store,
   control, communicate, configure, measure, and manage big data produced
   by IoT devices. In this survey, the authors have performed a
   comprehensive study on fog computing and have classified various such
   paradigms. The authors have performed an extensive evaluation of
   features, along with the algorithmic and architectural packages deployed
   in the framework. This survey covers various 5G-enabled Industrial IoT
   (I-IoT) application settings and unleashes various fog framework-based
   solutions for numerous real-world application challenges in sustainable
   smart city infrastructures. Numerous contributions of fog computing
   towards latency-sensitive applications like healthcare 4.0, smart
   conveyance, smart waste management, smart energy handling, etc. has also
   been discussed. Fog computing framework apart from the abilities, also
   inherits various security flaws from cloud computing paradigm, and these
   flaws needs to be rectified in the interest of the end user. This survey
   presents a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art literature schemes
   to preserve the integrity of data in sustainable smart city
   infrastructure. Diverse phrases employed for investigating numerous
   security and privacy concerns in 5G enabled technologies are discussed
   in a sophisticated approach.},

Abstract = {Crime is one of the most critical problems in urban centers, especially
   in large cities. In this sense, technological solutions are needed to
   provide security to citizens, contributing to the reduction of crime
   rates. The present work proposes the UFollower model (Ubiquitous
   Follower) which meets this scenario. The scientific contribution of this
   work consists of the use of Context Histories and User Profiles for data
   analysis focused on ubiquitous security. The use of prediction
   mechanisms and historical contexts allowed to reach up to 70.35\% of
   inference rate for a particular crime (domestic violence). The
   comparison with the related works indicates that UFollower is the only
   proposal that presents the issue of public security with context
   histories and user profile management. The evaluation was conducted
   through scenarios, allowing to evaluate the related hypotheses. In this
   sense, a context simulator was built where twenty objects interacted to
   allow the evolution. Among them, there are people, vehicles, cameras,
   and wearables.},

Title = {Forecasting Internet Demand Using Public Data: A Case Study in Brazil},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {6},
Pages = {65974-65980},
Abstract = {In Brazil, the government has historically given low attention to the
   planning of telecommunication infrastructure, such as the prediction of
   the Internet bandwidth in the short and medium term, since this process
   can be slow and costly. Notably, smart city applications are impaired by
   this policy, because they depend on cost-benefit technology to support
   the Internet of Things. This paper presents a method for forecasting the
   Internet demand based on public data obtained from the International
   Telecommunication Union, the World Bank, and government agencies, using
   Brazil as a case study. The information inputs are associated with the
   population growth, and with social and technological development. The
   prediction process uses statistic concepts and models to infer the
   relationship between input variables and the data bandwidth rate. The
   proposed methodology is not restricted to the prediction of the Internet
   demand and may also be used to estimate other concerns for developing
   countries, such as oil, energy, and water consumption. The method is
   compared with other time series analysis models. The results reveal that
   factors related to innovation and technology significantly impact the
   annual projection of the Internet demand.},

Abstract = {As a result of population growth in large cities face everyday problems
   related to urban mobility such as congestion, quality of urban roads and
   inefficiency of public transport. Intelligent transport systems
   initiatives act as an efficient solution to improve the functioning and
   performance of traffic systems, reducing congestion and increasing
   safety for citizens. However, due to the inclusion of different and
   distributed information sources on urban mobility, interoperability of
   the various technologies involved and the retention of these data are
   challenges that involve complex and costly efforts to governments and
   businesses. Thus, this article presents a proposal for georeferenced
   data retention architecture of Intelligent Transportation System in
   order to store this information georeferenced urban mobility in order to
   allow perform these activities more easily, and to promote
   interoperability between various applications. Therefore, the proposal
   was i9ITS architecture based on Service Oriented Architecture. It
   conducted a case study related to building an application that uses the
   i9ITS architecture for a taxi service company with real data. The use of
   this architecture proved to be effective and efficient to meet the
   proposed problem, as well as other possibilities to meet the demands and
   challenges related to Intelligent Transportation System.},

Abstract = {We have been experiencing technological modernization in all segments of
   cities, which enables the advancement of the smart cities concept
   through the use of technology to solve current and common problems in
   cities. Currently, numerous innovative technologies, such as artificial
   intelligence, big data, the Internet of Things, and sensors, are used to
   collect and analyze data regarding aspects of cities. Notably, more
   precise investments in data science make it possible to solve countless
   problems more safely and efficiently. More than 800 billion dollars are
   invested annually in the USA to make the urban mobility scenario safer
   and more efficient. In this perspective, the present work focuses on the
   application of a mathematical model, Multivariate Linear Regression, to
   a dataset that contains data about traffic accidents in the USA to
   understand the aspects, natural or not, that can characterize a higher
   risk of accidents in the USA.},

Abstract = {Cities are constantly transforming and, consequently, attracting efforts
   from researchers and opportunities to the industry. New transportation
   systems are being built in order to meet sustainability and efficiency
   criteria, as well as being adapted to the current possibilities.
   Moreover, citizens are becoming aware about the power and possibilities
   provided by the current generation of autonomous devices. In this sense,
   this paper presents and discusses state-of-the-art transportation
   technologies and systems, highlighting the advances that the concepts of
   Internet of Things and Value are providing. Decentralized technologies,
   such as blockchain, are been extensively investigated by the industry,
   however, its widespread adoption in cities is still desirable. Aligned
   with operations research opportunities, this paper identifies different
   points in which cities' services could move to. This also study comments
   about different combinatorial optimization problems that might be useful
   and important for an efficient evolution of our cities. By considering
   different perspectives, didactic examples are presented with a main
   focus on motivating decision makers to balance citizens, investors and
   industry goals and wishes.},

Abstract = {Smoke detection in Internet of Things (IoT) environment is a primary
   component of early disaster-related event detection in smart cities.
   Recently, several smoke and fire detection methods are presented with
   reasonable accuracy and running time for normal IoT environment.
   However, these methods are unable to detect smoke in foggy IoT
   environment, which is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose an
   energy-efficient system based on deep convolutional neural networks for
   early smoke detection in both normal and foggy IoT environments. Our
   method takes advantage of VGG-16 architecture, considering its sensible
   stability between the accuracy and time efficiency for smoke detection
   compared to the other computationally expensive networks, such as
   GoogleNet and AlexNet. Experiments performed on benchmark smoke
   detection datasets and their results in terms of accuracy, false alarms
   rate, and efficiency reveal the better performance of our technique
   compared to state-of-the-art and verifies its applicability in smart
   cities for early detection of smoke in normal and foggy IoT
   environments.},

Title = {On the Use of Cameras for the Detection of Critical Events in
   Sensors-Based Emergency Alerting Systems},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SENSOR AND ACTUATOR NETWORKS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {9},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The adoption of emergency alerting systems can bring countless benefits
   when managing urban areas, industrial plants, farms, roads and virtually
   any area that is subject to the occurrence of critical events,
   supporting in rescue operations and reducing their negative impacts. For
   such systems, a promising approach is to exploit scalar sensors to
   detect events of interest, allowing for the distributed monitoring of
   different variables. However, the use of cameras as visual sensors can
   enhance the detection of critical events, which can be employed along
   with scalar sensors for a more comprehensive perception of the
   environment. Although the particularities of visual sensing may be
   challenging in some scenarios, the combination of scalar and visual
   sensors for the early detection of emergency situations can be valuable
   for many scenarios, such as smart cities and industry 4.0, bringing
   promising results. Therefore, in this article, we extend a sensors-based
   emergency detection and alerting system to also exploit visual
   monitoring when identifying critical events. Implementation and
   experimental details are provided to reinforce the use of cameras as a
   relevant sensor unit, bringing promising results for emergencies
   management.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNET SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {The processing and power-consumption constraints of the Internet of
   Things devices hinder them to offer more complex network services than
   the simple data transmission in smart city scenarios. The lack of
   complex services, such as security and quality of service, can even
   foster disasters in urban centers. In this paper, we propose the
   integration of complex network services from the IoT devices till a
   cloud environment through an agile and effective network function
   virtualization infrastructure of isolated IoT domains. Therefore, our
   proposal develops a simple gateway access node that virtualizes the
   domains to which the devices connect. A prototype for services of
   security and quality of service has been implemented and its evaluation
   shows that virtualization of the access node does not impact the
   performance of virtual network functions. The results also show that the
   proposal provides security for IoT devices, identifying malicious
   traffic with 99.8\% accuracy, avoiding denial of essential services, and
   ensuring the quality of service.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {117652-117677},
Abstract = {Smart urban transportation management can be considered as a
   multifaceted big data challenge. It strongly relies on the information
   collected into multiple, widespread, and heterogeneous data sources as
   well as on the ability to extract actionable insights from them. Besides
   data, full stack (from platform to services and applications)
   Information and Communications Technology (ICT) solutions need to be
   specifically adopted to address smart cities challenges. Smart urban
   transportation management is one of the key use cases addressed in the
   context of the EUBra-BIGSEA (Europe-Brazil Collaboration of Big Data
   Scientific Research through Cloud-Centric Applications) project. This
   paper specifically focuses on the City Administration Dashboard, a
   public transport analytics application that has been developed on top of
   the EUBra-BIGSEA platform and used by the Municipality stakeholders of
   Curitiba, Brazil, to tackle urban traffic data analysis and planning
   challenges. The solution proposed in this paper joins together a
   scalable big and fast data analytics platform, a flexible and dynamic
   cloud infrastructure, data quality and entity matching algorithms as
   well as security and privacy techniques. By exploiting an interoperable
   programming framework based on Python Application Programming Interface
   (API), it allows an easy, rapid and transparent development of smart
   cities applications.},

Abstract = {By monitoring crime incidence with quantitative techniques, many studies
   have shown that it is possible to improve decision making through
   pattern recognition and prediction. In a smart city scenario, such
   approaches can be used to compose analytical background to improve
   resource allocation. This work presents a novel framework to improve
   patrol planning that precisely provides places and times that are likely
   to be more dangerous than short-term average using a portfolio of
   machine learning algorithms. Our approach follows an
   algorithm-as-a-service architecture (AaaS), providing insights to
   existing public safety systems and platforms. The service comprises the
   broader ROTA framework, a robust public safety platform devised for the
   ongoing smart cities initiative of Natal, Brazil. Results of an
   experimental evaluation provided insights about spatial granularity
   effects on the performance of the estimators adopted. Furthermore, an
   evaluation on algorithm selection demonstrates its outcomes on the
   hotspot detection task.},

Abstract = {The rapid urbanization of cities has given rise to numerous challenges
   related to essential services and emergency management. To address these
   complexities, smart city solutions have emerged, employing advanced
   technologies to automate and enhance service quality. In this context,
   wireless sensor networks and the Internet of Things offer promising
   solutions for monitoring and detecting emergencies in urban
   environments. However, urban emergency detection is a complex task that
   requires intelligent data processing and analysis. Many existing
   approaches utilize artificial intelligence techniques to improve
   accuracy. Moreover, the time-critical nature of emergency detection
   necessitates swift and reliable diagnosis to avoid potential economic
   losses and human risks. To achieve precise and timely detection, a
   system capable of collecting georeferenced data, analyzing it, and
   providing reliable diagnoses is essential. In this paper, we propose a
   novel urban multiple emergency detection system based on hierarchical,
   collaborative and configurable wireless sensor networks. The
   hierarchical and collaborative nature of the proposed networks ensures
   efficient data exchange between sensing units of different categories.
   Our contributions lie in the implementation of flexible and configurable
   functionalities, enabling accurate and energy-efficient urban emergency
   detection adaptable to the unique characteristics of each city or region
   where it is deployed.},

Abstract = {The urbanisation of the last century has created a significant demand
   for urban areas to deliver public services that are efficient,
   sustainable, and adaptable. This demand is further amplified by the
   anticipated impacts of climate change and the complexities introduced by
   rapidly expanding urban populations. In this scenario, smart city
   initiatives have emerged as a pivotal strategy to address these
   challenges, leveraging innovative technologies and paradigms such as
   Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science to improve
   the quality of urban life in a more sustainable way. Recently, research
   efforts in these domains have focused on creating systems that can adapt
   and respond to changing conditions, enabling greater adaptivity and
   responsiveness to the needs of urban landscapes. Therefore, this article
   provides a comprehensive survey of adaptive urban services within a
   smart city context. Through analyses of recent literature, we
   investigate the technological foundations that enable the adaptivity of
   urban services and explore their applications in various urban
   scenarios, including energy, mobility, emergency management, public
   safety, and waste management. This article also highlights the benefits
   of adopting adaptive urban services, such as improved traffic
   management, resilient emergency management, and enhanced citizen
   engagement, bringing an important contribution to this broad research
   area. Finally, we provide a discussion on current technology enablers
   and challenges and present an overview for future research directions on
   adaptive urban systems at the forefront of transforming cities into more
   intelligent ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Parking spaces are costly to build, parking payments are difficult to
   enforce, and drivers waste an excessive amount of time searching for
   empty lots. Accurate quantification would inform developers and
   municipalities in space allocation and design, while real-time
   measurements would provide drivers and parking enforcement with
   information that saves time and resources. In this paper, we propose an
   accurate and real-time video system for future Internet of Things (IoT)
   and smart cities applications. Using recent developments in deep
   convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and a novel vehicle tracking
   filter, we combine information across multiple image frames in a video
   sequence to remove noise introduced by occlusions and detection
   failures. We demonstrate that our system achieves higher accuracy than
   pure image-based instance segmentation, and is comparable in performance
   to industry benchmark systems that utilize more expensive sensors, such
   as radar. Furthermore, our system shows significant potential in its
   scalability to a city-wide scale and also in the richness of its output
   that goes beyond traditional binary occupancy statistics.},

Abstract = {With the advancement of information and communication technologies
   (ICTs), there has been high-scale utilization of IoT and adoption of AI
   in the transportation system to improve the utilization of energy,
   reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, increase quality of services, and
   provide many extensive benefits to the commuters and transportation
   authorities. In this article, we propose a novel edge-based AI-IoT
   integrated energy-efficient intelligent transport system for smart
   cities by using a distributed multi-agent system. An urban area is
   divided into multiple regions, and each region is sub-divided into a
   finite number of zones. At each zone an optimal number of RSUs are
   installed along with the edge computing devices. The MAS deployed at
   each RSU collects a huge volume of data from the various sensors,
   devices, and infrastructures. The edge computing device uses the
   collected raw data from the MAS to process, analyze, and predict. The
   predicted information will be shared with the neighborhood RSUs,
   vehicles, and cloud by using MAS with the help of IoT. The predicted
   information can be used by freight vehicles to maintain smooth and
   steady movement, which results in reduction in GHG emissions and energy
   consumption, and finally improves the freight vehicles' mileage by
   reducing traffic congestion in the urban areas. We have exhaustively
   carried out the simulation results and demonstrated the effectiveness of
   the proposed system.},

Abstract = {With the development of smart cities, the demand for artificial
   intelligence (AI) based services grows exponentially. The existing works
   just focus on cloud-edge or edge-device cooperative AI which suffers low
   learning efficiency of AI, while edge-to-edge cooperative AI is still an
   unresolved issue. Moreover, the existing researches concentrate on the
   computation offloading of the AI-based task, ignoring that it is a
   brain-like task performing sophisticated processing to raw data, which
   leads to the high latency and low quality of the learning services. To
   address these challenges, this paper proposes an on-demand learning
   offloading mechanism for edge-to-edge cooperative AI. Firstly, the
   principle of the learning capability and its offloading are proposed for
   the formal description of the learning resources migration. Secondly,
   the proposed mechanism realizes the bilateral learning offloading
   utilizing edge-to-edge and cloud-edge collaborations to handle AI-based
   tasks with high learning efficiency and resource utilization rate.
   Moreover, we model the edge-to-edge learning offloading allocation based
   on the concatenation of deep neural network (DNN) subtasks and their
   heterogeneous requirement of learning resources. Simulation results
   indicate the rationality and efficiency of the proposed mechanism.},

Abstract = {Around the world, municipalities have been making substantial
   investments into broadband access infrastructure to accelerate the
   build-out of an urban phenomenon that has become known as a smart or
   connected city. At the 2016 Optical Fiber Communications Conference, a
   team contest, the Connected OFCity Challenge, was held to discuss the
   technological innovations and to examine dependencies and intricacies of
   a connected city project. The participants, four teams of experts coming
   from a cross-section of the industry, presented and defended their
   visions of future applications and innovative architecture and
   technologies to realize the interconnection. This paper provides a
   synthesis of the four competitive proposals offered for the contest and
   their ensuing discussions.},

Title = {An IoT-Based Framework for Smart Water Supply Systems Management},
Journal = {FUTURE INTERNET},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {12},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The world's population growth and climate changes increase the demand
   for high-quality water. This fact forces humankind to create new water
   management strategies. Smart cities have successfully applied the
   Internet of Things (IoT) technology in many sectors. Moreover, Complex
   Event Processing (CEP) can analyze and process large data sets produced
   by IoT sensors in real-time. Traditional business processes are too
   rigid in expressing the dynamic behavior of water supply systems. Every
   execution path must be explicitly specified. On the other hand,
   declarative business processes allow execution paths that are not
   prohibited by the rules, providing more flexibility for water supply
   managers. This paper joins together IoT, CEP, and declarative processes
   to create a powerful, efficient, and flexible architecture (REFlex
   Water) to manage water supply systems. To the knowledge of the authors,
   REFlex Water is the first solution to combine these technologies in the
   context of water supply systems. The paper describes the REFlex Water
   architecture and demonstrates its application to a real water system
   from a Brazilian municipality. Results are promising, and the managers
   from the Brazilian water company are expanding the use of REFlex Water
   to other sectors of their water supply system.},

Abstract = {A large number of vehicles routinely navigate through city streets; with
   on-board sensors, they can be transformed into a dynamic network that
   monitors the urban environment comprehensively and efficiently. In this
   paper, drive-by approaches are discussed as a form of mobile sensing,
   that offer a number of advantages over more traditional sensing
   approaches. It is shown that the physical properties of the urban
   environment that can be captured using drive-by sensing include ambient
   fluid, electromagnetic, urban envelope, photonic, and acoustic
   properties, which comprise the FEELS classification. In addition, the
   spatiotemporal variations of these phenomena are discussed as well as
   their implications on discrete-time sampling. The mobility patterns of
   sensor-hosting vehicles play a major role in drive-by sensing. Vehicles
   with scheduled trajectories, e.g., buses, and those with less
   predictable mobility patterns, e.g., taxis, are investigated for sensing
   efficacy in terms of spatial and temporal coverage. City Scanner is a
   drive-by approach with a modular sensing architecture, which enables
   cost-effective mass data acquisition on a multitude of city features.
   The City Scanner framework follows a centralized IoT regime to generate
   a near real-time visualization of sensed data. The sensing platform was
   mounted on top of garbage trucks and collected drive-by data for eight
   months in Cambridge, MA, USA. Acquired data were streamed to the cloud
   for processing and subsequent analyses. Based on a real-world
   application, we discuss and show the potential of using drive-by
   approaches to collect environmental data in urban areas using a variety
   of nondedicated land vehicles to optimize data collection in terms of
   spatiotemporal coverage.},

Abstract = {We live in a disruptive moment where technology plays a crucial role in
   capturing and analyzing citizens' vital signs in real time. Although
   having a vast literature on providing health-based intelligent cities,
   the current articles are disappointing since explanations about scale,
   module interactions, and processing capabilities need to be detailed.
   Here, we present an in-depth vision of a new vital sign-driven smart
   city, highlighting each hierarchical level, its modules, and
   interactions. This article addresses Internet of Things data capturing,
   buffering schemes, hierarchical messaging engines, health services, task
   offloading among layers, person and service priority computation,
   different dashboards, and notification centers. Although edge, fog, and
   cloud are not new topics, their scalable blending in favor of delivering
   digital health is. The presented architecture helps fight against the
   COVID-19 and other pandemics sequels since data regarding temperature,
   respiratory rate, heart rate variability, and oxygen saturation of the
   whole population could be analyzed efficiently.},

   have been widely used to monitor and control the flow of vehicles.
   However, with the increasing number of public (bus) and private vehicles
   (car, motorcycle, and truck), urban centers are becoming more and more
   populous. Such phenomenon leads to traffic congestion and increases
   environmental and noise pollution. In order to stem the rise of such
   problems, large cities are adopting technological solutions,
   materializing the concept of smart cities. While observing traffic
   management systems themselves, several hardware and software solutions
   have been studied and implemented around the world. This article aims to
   contribute to traffic signals improvement by developing a centralized
   traffic light control system, using a unique wireless communication
   network. In order to prove the system's effectiveness, the most common
   types of urban intersections were analyzed. Direct control routines were
   implemented for network traffic lights, providing a complete control
   system for extraordinary events, such as closing roads due to accidents
   or public events. Finally, safety routines were formulated to report the
   operating status of the traffic light system lamps to a central
   management. With the aid of a logic analyzer connected to the outputs
   for each focal group, it was possible to set up an operating stages
   timing diagram of each traffic light. Thus, the system validation was
   achieved based on theoretical and practical timing diagrams
   similarities.},

Abstract = {LoRaWAN is an Internet of Things (IoT) technology with super usability
   due to its ability to support low-power and long-range communications.
   However, implementation and optimization require path-loss (PL) modeling
   to estimate network coverage and performance. In this context, the
   LoRaWAN radio channel is investigated for uplink and downlink in the
   915-MHz band. Extensive measurement campaigns were conducted outdoors in
   suburban locations of Belem, specifically in the neighborhoods of
   Pedreira and Marco. Based on empirical results, PL models are developed
   for LoRaWAN communications in uplink and downlink are compared to widely
   used empirical models. In addition, coverage, shading regions, SNR
   analysis, and percentage received packets are based on real
   measurements. The results show that the proposed PL models are accurate,
   easy to implement, and applied in similar regions for LoRa network
   planning in suburban smart cities.},

Title = {Heracles: A Context-Based Multisensor Sensor Data Fusion Algorithm for
   the Internet of Things},
Journal = {INFORMATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In the Internet of Things (IoT), extending the average battery duration
   of devices is of paramount importance, since it promotes uptime without
   intervention in the environment, which can be undesirable or costly. In
   the IoT, the system's functionalities are distributed among devices that
   (i) collect, (ii) transmit and (iii) apply algorithms to process and
   analyze data. A widely adopted technique for increasing the lifetime of
   an IoT system is using data fusion on the devices that process and
   analyze data. There are already several works proposing data fusion
   algorithms for the context of wireless sensor networks and IoT. However,
   most of them consider that application requirements (such as the data
   sampling rate and the data range of the events of interest) are
   previously known, and the solutions are tailored for a single target
   application. In the context of a smart city, we envision that the IoT
   will provide a sensing and communication infrastructure to be shared by
   multiple applications, that will make use of this infrastructure in an
   opportunistic and dynamic way, with no previous knowledge about its
   requirements. In this work, we present Heracles, a new data fusion
   algorithm tailored to meet the demands of the IoT for smart cities.
   Heracles considers the context of the application, adapting to the
   features of the dataset to perform the data analysis. Heracles aims at
   minimizing data transmission to save energy while generating value-added
   information, which will serve as input for decision-making processes.
   Results of the performed evaluation show that Heracles is feasible,
   enhances the performance of decision methods and extends the system
   lifetime.},

Title = {Speed prediction in large and dynamic traffic sensor networks},
Journal = {INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {98},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Smart cities are nowadays equipped with pervasive networks of sensors
   that monitor traffic in real-time and record huge volumes of traffic
   data. These datasets constitute a rich source of information that can be
   used to extract knowledge useful for municipalities and citizens. In
   this paper we are interested in exploiting such data to estimate future
   speed in traffic sensor networks, as accurate predictions have the
   potential to enhance decision making capabilities of traffic management
   systems. Building effective speed prediction models in large cities
   poses important challenges that stem from the complexity of traffic
   patterns, the number of traffic sensors typically deployed, and the
   evolving nature of sensor networks. Indeed, sensors are frequently added
   to monitor new road segments or replaced/removed due to different
   reasons (e.g., maintenance). Exploiting a large number of sensors for
   effective speed prediction thus requires smart solutions to collect vast
   volumes of data and train effective prediction models. Furthermore, the
   dynamic nature of real-world sensor networks calls for solutions that
   are resilient not only to changes in traffic behavior, but also to
   changes in the network structure, where the cold start problem
   represents an important challenge. We study three different approaches
   in the context of large and dynamic sensor networks: local, global, and
   cluster-based. The local approach builds a specific prediction model for
   each sensor of the network. Conversely, the global approach builds a
   single prediction model for the whole sensor network. Finally, the
   cluster-based approach groups sensors into homogeneous clusters and
   generates a model for each cluster. We provide a large dataset,
   generated from similar to 1.3 billion records collected by up to 272
   sensors deployed in Fortaleza, Brazil, and use it to experimentally
   assess the effectiveness and resilience of prediction models built
   according to the three aforementioned approaches. The results show that
   the global and cluster-based approaches provide very accurate prediction
   models that prove to be robust to changes in traffic behavior and in the
   structure of sensor networks. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights

Abstract = {There will be a profound impact from 5G to develop smart cities.
   Questions such as ``How telecommunication operators will efficiently
   provide network infrastructure{''}, ``When and where the quality of
   service parameters are degraded or below expected{''} are to be
   considered. In this context, the use of base stations carried by
   Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) acting as flying cells to compensate
   areas where telecommunications systems are challenged by abnormal
   conditions during their operation has attracted attention. In this
   paper, we propose an intelligent solution based on a novel multilayered
   cellular automata for positioning flying cells and improvement of
   network capacity in context heavy traffic situations as congested cars
   in avenues in some hours of the day, crowded events, disaster or hot
   spot traffic. In our distributed approach, all UAV base stations operate
   in parallel. The self-organisation arises from an emergent pattern based
   on applying simple rules in a defined neighbourhood. The proposed scheme
   considers both backhaul and radio access network constraints, and user
   requirements in terms of downlink throughput. Simulation results show
   that the proposed algorithm performs favourably compared with other
   schemes in terms of all metrics considered. Therefore, we provide a
   solution for rapid and efficient positioning of multiple UAV base
   stations to respond in real time to urgent network changes.},

Abstract = {The trend of an ever-increasing number of geographically distributed
   sensors producing data for a plethora of applications, from
   environmental monitoring to smart cities and autonomous driving, is
   shifting the computing paradigm from cloud to fog. The increase in the
   volume of produced data makes the processing and the aggregation of
   information at a single remote data center unfeasible or too expensive,
   while latency-critical applications cannot cope with the high network
   delays of a remote data center. Fog computing is a preferred solution as
   latency-sensitive tasks can be moved closer to the sensors. Furthermore,
   the same fog nodes can perform data aggregation and filtering to reduce
   the volume of data that is forwarded to the cloud data centers, reducing
   the risk of network overload. In this paper, we focus on the problem of
   designing a fog infrastructure considering both the location of how many
   fog nodes are required, which nodes should be considered (from a list of
   potential candidates), and how to allocate data flows from sensors to
   fog nodes and from there to cloud data centers. To this aim, we propose
   and evaluate a formal model based on a multi-objective optimization
   problem. We thoroughly test our proposal for a wide range of parameters
   and exploiting a reference scenario setup taken from a realistic smart
   city application. We compare the performance of our proposal with other
   approaches to the problem available in literature, taking into account
   two objective functions. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed
   model is viable for the design of fog infrastructure and can outperform
   the alternative models, with results that in several cases are close to
   an ideal solution.},

Abstract = {Context: A portion of the users in the Sao Paulo Metro are people who
   have physical limitations and need the help of wheelchairs or other
   similar devices. In this way, the Metro stations have elevators that
   allow these users to move between the floors of the station. In order,
   for the elevator to be used, it is necessary for the user to call the
   operators of the stations, who, in turn, check if the user who is
   requesting access to the elevator fits the target audience. Problem:
   This type of request requires manual validation by station operators,
   causing interruptions in their work routines and delays in passenger
   travel. Solution: To implement and evaluate artificial intelligence
   methods for automatic detection of people in wheelchairs or other
   auxiliary devices. IS Theory: This project was idealized from the
   perspective of Customer Focus Theory. Method: The You Only Look Once
   (YOLOv5) neural network was implemented in the Mobility Aids database.
   Tests were performed considering the original and modified base,
   composed of a reduced number of images, aiming to assess whether the
   accuracy of the model remains even with reduced database data. Summary
   of Results: The results obtained show an average accuracy of more than
   92\% with the modified database. Contribution: The results corroborated
   our methodology and we will be able to test in Sao Paulo subway with
   real images. In a long term, It is expected that by automating such a
   task, operators will be less overloaded and passengers with reduced
   mobility will gain more autonomy.},

Abstract = {The smart city vision has driven the rapid development and advancement
   of interconnected technologies using the Internet of Things (IoT) and
   cyber-physical systems (CPS). In this paper, various aspects of IoT and
   CPS in recent years (from 2013 to May 2023) are surveyed. It first
   begins with industry standards which ensure cost-effective solutions and
   interoperability. With ever-growing big data, tremendous undiscovered
   knowledge can be mined to be transformed into useful applications.
   Machine learning algorithms are taking the lead to achieve various
   target applications with formulations such as classification,
   clustering, regression, prediction, and anomaly detection. Notably,
   attention has shifted from traditional machine learning algorithms to
   advanced algorithms, including deep learning, transfer learning, and
   data generation algorithms, to provide more accurate models. In recent
   years, there has been an increasing need for advanced security
   techniques and defense strategies to detect and prevent the IoT and CPS
   from being attacked. Research challenges and future directions are
   summarized. We hope that more researchers can conduct more studies on
   the IoT and on CPS.},

Abstract = {The main objective of this study is to propose a cyber-physical system
   (CPS)-based person reidentification (P-ReID) framework for smart
   surveillance. The Internet of Things (IoT)-based interconnected vision
   sensors in smart cities are considered essential elements of a CPS, and
   contribute significantly to urban security. However, the
   reidentification of targeted persons using emerging edge AI techniques
   still faces certain challenges. To improve efficiency at the edge and
   overcome the traditional sensing of video cameras, we employed an
   AI-based P-ReID framework for CPS that is functional in IoT
   environments. In addition, we present dual attention dilated network
   (DADNet), which integrates an energy-efficient convolutional neural
   network (CNN) with a self-attention module to substantially improve the
   person matching probability. Furthermore, we applied dual feature fusion
   to intelligently integrate discriminative and robust features using
   early and late fusion strategies that allow DADNet to significantly
   consider the foreground and marginally utilize the background
   information. Furthermore, we impose diversity orthogonality
   regularization over several CNN layers, which boosts the performance of
   DADNet, resulting in an appropriate usage over IoT networks. A
   comprehensive set of ablation studies, comparison with other
   state-of-the-art approaches, and a time complexity analysis confirm the
   strength of our DADNet for reidentification tasks in AI-enabled IoT
   settings that are well suited for a CPS.},

Abstract = {Smart cities should be built on harmonious relationships with the
   environment, with rational measures to use environmental resources in
   many ways. Resources essential to human life such as water and energy
   must have special attention. With the advance of technologies use, human
   being becomes one of the main promoters of information and solutions for
   smart cities. Stream machine learning is an approach where data becomes
   available sequentially, called data stream, which adapts the prediction
   model with fixed window-sized data stream. The objective of this work is
   to analyze the effectiveness of buildings energy consumption using
   stream learning. To achieve this goal, MOA(1) tool was used to evaluate
   the performance of the selected stream learning algorithms on an an open
   database. Batch algorithms were also used as testbed, to analyze the
   performance of stream algorithms related to them. Our work shows that
   stream learning can show good results in this scenario.},

Abstract = {Facing the increasing complexity of large urban centers caused by
   population growth and the dynamic nature of cities, their managers seek
   to optimize services and infrastructures in terms of scalability,
   environment, and security to adapt to demand, making their cities
   smarter. Therefore, these new modern centers' administrators should
   apply smart governance techniques to manage the physical and data
   infrastructure and seek alignment with the global open data initiative.
   As a point of intersection between physical and data infrastructure, 3D
   models of cities have been playing an important role in people's daily
   lives, being a fundamental element for several applications. In this
   context, CityGML, a semantic model for 3D data representation adopted by
   several cities, appears as a possible solution for modeling. This paper
   presents an approach of integrating open data in the semi-automatic
   generation of 3D models based on CityGML, ``enriching{''} semantic
   information about the instances with the association with the
   OpenStreetMaps database. A case study was performed using data provided
   by the Municipality of Porto Alegre, BR. The model generated in CityGML
   goes through semantic, geometric, and schema level validations, proving
   the proposed approach's feasibility.},

Abstract = {Garbage collection carried out improperly contributes to the impact on
   sustainability. Projections indicate that CO2 emissions related to solid
   waste will reach 2.38 billion tons/year by 2050. Waste collection is the
   first step of a management system, and its optimization with the help of
   IoT can reduce the impact. We model and prototype the waste collection
   management ecosystem that allows for efficient collection by monitoring
   garbage cans. The optimization in the route of the collection trucks
   indicated a gain of up to 20\% in the resources involved.},

Title = {Reliability enhancement of packet delivery in multi-hop wireless sensor
   network},
Journal = {COMPUTER NETWORKS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {153},
Pages = {86-91},
Month = {APR 22},
Abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks are used to collect a large amount of data in
   the field and forward it to data collectors, which are also responsible
   to analyze such data for a particular purpose. However, the wireless
   communication is susceptible to noise and interference, which results in
   loss of information in the routes from the sensors to the data
   aggregators. In addition, the devices used in these networks have
   restrictions on their processing, storage, and communication capacity,
   which diminishes, even more, the reliability of the data delivery.
   Therefore, this work describes a new communication method named mu Net,
   which aims to increase the delivery rate of packets in multi-hop WSN.
   Such approach is based on peer-to-peer control messages to ensure that
   the packet has been properly forwarded. Besides that, the mu Net is
   designed to be compatible with constrained devices, reducing the size of
   headers of the protocols and the size of the network buffer. By
   comparing mu Net with widely used WSN protocols, it is demonstrated that
   this approach results in better end-to-end reliability in networks
   susceptible to interference. (C) 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

Abstract = {Over the years, there has been a significant increase in the prevalence
   of diseases associated with the misuse of alcoholic beverages, resulting
   in three million annual deaths worldwide. Despite this alarming trend,
   there is a lack of dedicated applications to support individuals in
   their recovery from alcohol abuse. In light of this situation, the
   literature presents machine learning techniques that can be employed to
   identify and characterize urban areas with a high propensity for alcohol
   consumption in major cities. This study explores the utilization of
   Location-Based Social Networks (LBSN) to assess alcohol consumption
   habits in Tokyo and New York. Data from check-ins at bars and
   restaurants were collected, and through clustering methods, the study
   examined the drinking patterns of urban residents. The findings revealed
   that, while there were cultural variations in drinking behaviors between
   the two cities, users tended to consume more alcohol during weekends and
   nighttime. Furthermore, the research successfully pinpointed the regions
   most conducive to such consumption.},

Abstract = {This investigation starts with the hypothesis that fusing heterogeneous
   data sources can increase the data coverage and improve the accuracy of
   traffic-related applications in Intelligent Transportation Systems
   (ITS). Therefore, we designed (i) a Data Fusion on Intelligent
   Transportation Systems (DataFITS) framework that allows collecting data
   from numerous sources and fusing them according to spatial and temporal
   criteria; (ii) a traffic estimation method that groups road segments
   into regions, identify correlations between them, and measure the
   traffic distribution to estimate traffic. As a result, DataFITS
   increased by 130\% the number of road segments coverage and enhanced, by
   fusion process, around 35\% of road overlapping data sources. We
   evaluate the traffic estimation of the 15 most correlated regions, where
   the fused data together with correlated areas resulted in the best
   traffic estimation accuracy by reaching up to 40\% in some cases and 9\%
   on average.},

Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {RPL is the de-facto IPv6-based routing protocol for the Internet of
   Things (IoT), where networks are mainly formed by sensors and other low
   capacity devices. However, RPL lacks scalability and is inefficient in
   any-to any communications. In this article, we present IoTorii, a
   hierarchical protocol that creates routes based on a probe frame,
   instead of the computation of a distance vector, as in RPL. We
   implemented a proof-of-concept of IoTorii and compared it with RPL,
   proving lower number of table entries, decreased exchanged control
   messages and faster convergence time, with similar path hop count, which
   is particularly promising in the IoT field.},

Abstract = {With the evolution of radio technologies during the last decades,
   companies are replacing equipment with individual components with
   particular functions by systems where most signals are treated digitally
   through digital signal processing techniques. In environments with
   numerous wireless equipment transmitting simultaneously, it is necessary
   to detect the frequency spectrum occupancy before deploying a new
   solution. A spectrum analyzer can analyze this, but the cost of
   acquiring suitable equipment can be very high. Besides that, these
   devices only allow the user to analyze the frequency spectrum, not the
   technology itself, packet loss, data rate, and coverage, without an
   expensive software license installed. This article presents a
   software-defined radio application development capable of evaluating
   wireless channels for new IoT technologies, such as Bluetooth or Wi-SUN.},

Abstract = {A startup ecosystem is a creative environment aiming to promote
   entrepreneurship and innovation. Startups interact with other entities,
   building a complex social network. Those connections arise from the
   interdependence and co-evolution ties between different actors, who
   share resources to achieve common goals. A smart startup ecosystem
   demands an understanding of the interests and capabilities of each
   participant. It could allow identifying convergences and possible
   partnerships that can help in the new business growth. The Coral
   platform is a social network analysis based approach to assist in
   evaluating existing relationships in communities. This paper applies the
   Coral platform to support incubators' activities in the local community
   improvements. Our case study investigated the members' social and
   technological aspects in a small entrepreneurial group according to the
   essential indicators defined by managers: experts, reputation, and
   professional profile.},

Abstract = {Context: Modern Information Systems require the use of contemporary
   software systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems, Embedded Systems, and
   Smart Cities-based Systems, eventually built under the paradigm of the
   Internet of Things. These Contemporary Software Systems (CSS) add new
   challenges for their construction, maintainability, and evolution,
   including the involvement of many actors with the software project and
   the necessary management of dependencies among hardware/things, software
   systems, and people. Problem: These technological challenges jeopardize
   the final quality of modern information systems due to the lack of
   adequate mechanisms supporting the engineering of CSS. Solution:
   Continuous Experimentation (CE) deserves some investigation regarding
   its suitability to mitigate and reduce engineering CSS risks. IS Theory:
   This research is under the General Systems Theory and is consistent with
   the Systems Information challenges regarding building smart cities-based
   systems. Method: To undertake a Structured Literature Review (StLR)
   supported with snowballing to reveal CE's empirical studies. Results:
   The StLR identified seven primary studies on CE adoption to support CSS
   building. Many studies are in the domain of embedded systems and CPS.
   Besides, the findings allowed us to conjecture a set of challenges and
   opportunities regarding using CE in CSS engineering. Conclusion: There
   are emergent technologies to support CE's execution in the context of
   web-based systems. However, several challenges and gaps surround CE's
   use for engineering CSS. Furthermore, the lack of software technologies,
   blueprints, or concrete guidance to promote CE in these software systems
   can motivate further investigations into its use in engineering the
   important parts of modern information systems.},

Abstract = {The majority of the global population now resides in cities, and this
   trend continues to grow. In this context, the Internet of Things (IoT)
   is crucial in transforming existing urban areas into Smart Cities.
   However, IoT architectures mainly focus on machine-to-machine
   interactions, leaving human involvement aside. The Internet of
   Everything (IoE) includes human-to-human and human-machine
   collaboration, but the specifics of these interactions are still
   under-explored. As urban populations grow and IoT integrates into city
   infrastructure, efficient, collaborative architectures become crucial.
   In this work, we use the Rapid Review methodology to analyze
   collaboration in four prevalent computing architectures in the IoE
   paradigm, namely Edge Computing, Cloud Computing, Blockchain/Web
   Services, and Fog Computing. To analyze the collaboration, we use the 3C
   collaboration model, comprising communication, cooperation, and
   coordination. Our findings highlight the importance of Edge and Cloud
   Computing for enhancing collaborative coordination, focusing on
   efficiency and network optimization. Edge Computing supports real-time,
   low-latency processing at data sources, while Cloud Computing offers
   scalable resources for diverse workloads, optimizing coordination and
   productivity. Effective resource allocation and network configuration in
   these architectures are essential for cohesive IoT ecosystems.
   Therefore, this work offers a comparative analysis of four computing
   architectures, clarifying their capabilities and limitations. Smart
   Cities are a major beneficiary of these insights. This knowledge can
   help researchers and practitioners choose the best architecture for IoT
   and IoE environments. Additionally, by applying the 3C collaboration
   model, the article provides a framework for improving collaboration in
   IoT and IoE systems.},

Abstract = {The use of sensors for the monitoring of a given environment allied with
   the Internet as a means of communication is popularly known as Internet
   of Things (IoT). The amount of information generated in this environment
   has led to an unprecedented increase in data collection. One of the
   major challenges for its development lies in the storage and the
   processing of this huge volume of data into acceptable measurements and
   analysis parameters. This research takes up this challenge by storing
   and compiling data from different sensors, and by carrying out an
   exploratory analysis of the information gathered. In this research,
   sensors that collect data from a specific Sao Paulo's Metropolitan Area
   (SMA) have been analysed. These sensors are capable of measuring carbon
   monoxide (CO) levels. This research aims to analyse the main
   architectures for both batch and stream sensor processing and to use one
   of them for the construction of a Big Data environment. Big Data tools
   were used for IoT storage, processing and visualization data. During the
   experiments, carbon monoxide sensors (MQ7), were analysed. They were
   connected through a microcontroller unit that supports the Transmission
   Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). This project highlights the
   necessary tools to execute and analyse the data in a dynamic manner. The
   data collected by the sensors show that the avarage levels of carbon
   monoxide are well above the international standards set by the World
   Health Organization (WHO).},

Title = {Human Inertial Thinking Strategy: A Novel Fuzzy Reasoning Mechanism for

Abstract = {Computer vision has always been a hot field of research by contemporary
   scholars due to its wide range of applications. As an important branch
   of this field, the visual monitoring technology has shown superior
   vitality in the actual monitoring environment of the Internet of Things
   (IoT). However, when the monitoring environment is complex, once the
   target monitoring fails, the important information related to the target
   also disappears. At this time, if the existing monitoring method is
   used, the target cannot be monitored again. Moreover, the current
   filtering monitoring algorithm also has the problem of poor
   interpretability. Therefore, this article combines the relevant
   characteristics of human inertial thinking when dealing with such
   problems. First, our method screens the movement information of the
   target and introduces a fuzzy reasoning mechanism to infer the location
   area of the target through fuzzy thinking. Then, an alternative
   selection strategy based on the thinking set is applied, which
   alternates between the location of thinking reasoning and the location
   of memory to further obtain the effective visual monitoring of the
   target. The filtering and monitoring algorithm fused with the new
   mechanism in the OTB-2015 data set, the UVA123 data set, and the TC128
   data set all show that the proposed fuzzy inference mechanism has good
   robustness and universality. Furthermore, our results confirm that it
   can not only ensure the monitoring speed and overall accuracy but also
   improve the stability of monitoring in the IoT-assisted monitoring
   environment, showing its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art
   methods. In addition, our results confirm that the integration of the
   proposed edge learning method with the IoT can be well applied to the
   construction of smart cities and future generation systems.},

Abstract = {The maintenance of the quality of the public transport service in big
   cities requires constant monitoring, which may become an expensive and
   time-consuming practice. The perception of quality, from the users point
   of view is an important aspect of quality monitoring. In this sense, we
   proposed a methodology based on big data analysis and visualization,
   which allows for the structuring of estimates and assumptions of where
   and who seems to be having unsatisfactory experiences while making use
   of the public transportation in metropolitan areas. Moreover, it
   provides support in setting up a plan for on-site quality surveys. The
   proposed methodology increases the likelihood that, with the on-site
   visits, the interviewer finds users who suffer inconveniences, which
   influence their behavior. Simulation comparison and a small-scale pilot
   survey helped validate the proposed method.},

Abstract = {Understanding how commercial and social activities and points of
   interest are located in a city is essential to plan efficient cities in
   smart mobility. Over the years, the growth of data sources from distinct
   online social networks has enabled new perspectives to applications that
   provide mechanisms to aid in comprehension of how people displaces
   between different regions within a city. To support enterprises and
   governments better understand and compare distinct regions of a city,
   this work proposes a web application called PlaceProfile to perform
   visual profiling of city areas based on iconographic visualization and
   to label areas based on clustering algorithms. The visualization results
   are overlayered on Google Maps to enrich the map layout and aid analyst
   in understanding region profiling at a glance. Besides, PlaceProfile
   coordinates a radar chart with areas selected by the user to enable
   detailed inspection of the frequency of categories of points of interest
   (POIs). This linked views approach also supports clustering algorithms'
   explainability by providing inspections of the attributes used to
   compute similarities. We employed the proposed approach in a case study
   in the Sao Paulo city, Brazil.},

Title = {Combining taxi and social media data to explore urban mobility issues},
Journal = {COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2018},
Volume = {132},
Pages = {111-125},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Sensor networks, connected vehicles and mobile devices are currently
   used as data collectors in urban environments, data which can be used to
   better understand the cities' dynamics. Specifically, the study of
   data-driven solutions to understand the behavior of cities and propose
   services to enhance the experiences of the citizens in their everyday
   life has become an active research topic. Many studies in this topic
   focus on exploring single data sources, and, to tackle this limitation
   we propose the SMAFramework to collect and integrate urban mobility data
   from heterogeneous sources. In this work, we propose a methodology that
   enables the standardization of spatiotemporal annotated data from
   sources such as Sensor Networks, Vehicular Networks, Social Media and
   the Web over a single data model (i.e., a Multi-Aspect Graph) and
   perform different analyses, such as the identification of taxi demand.
   To show the potential of this framework, we built and assessed a tool to
   evaluate spatiotemporal correlation of urban data from different
   sources. Real data collected from social media and a taxi system of the
   city of New York are used to evaluate this method. The obtained results
   allowed us to understand some of the applicabilities of the SMAFramework
   and also provided some insights on how to use it to resolve specific
   problems when analyzing mobility in urban environments. Using this
   methodology, we can obtain a better taxi positioning within the city by
   employing social media data.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNET SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Number = {1},
Abstract = {Many IoT scenarios demand continuous capture of information from
   multifunctional sensors and smart units, as well as sending those data
   to cloud centers. However, allocating tasks to these sensors is not
   straightforward due to the urgency and priority that each type of data
   collection requires depending on the needs of the urban environment.
   This paper presents the POSITRON scheme for managing the sensing
   allocation in a multifunctional IoT network from previously defined
   policies. The policies take into account the characteristics of the
   applications running on the network and the different specifications of
   the available devices. We implemented POSITRON in a network simulator
   aiming to analyze its efficiency in allocating network resources. The
   results point out that considering the requirements demanded by
   applications and the distinct characteristics of multifunctional IoT
   devices brings benefits to resource allocation.},

Title = {Design and Implementation of a Smart Campus Flexible Internet of Things
   Architecture on a Brazilian University},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {113705-113725},
Abstract = {This work proposes a flexible and comprehensive Internet of Things (IoT)
   architecture designed for application on smart campuses to build their
   smart infrastructure and facilitate their transition to becoming smart.
   The concept of a smart campus is derived from the concept of a smart
   city, which was developed to demonstrate how urban areas were addressing
   their new and dynamic challenges by integrating technology and
   data-driven decision-making. Although the concept of the smart campus
   was initially conceived to study the smart city in a less complex
   setting, over time, both concepts have evolved into distinct areas of
   inquiry, exhibiting unique characteristics and impacts. In general, a
   smart campus is a university campus where information and communication
   technologies and IoT are applied to some or all the campus processes,
   thereby making these processes more efficient, cost-effective and
   environmentally sustainable for the institution, its members and the
   surrounding community. Additionally to presenting the proposal for a
   flexible and comprehensive architecture for a smart campus, this paper
   also demonstrates its interpretation for implementation on a Brazilian
   campus transitioning to become smart, the Institute of Science and
   Technology, Sorocaba (ICTS) - campus of the S \& atilde;o Paulo State
   University (Unesp) in Sorocaba, Brazil. To the best of the authors'
   knowledge, there is a scarcity of existing works which address this
   level of detail when proposing an IoT architecture for a smart campus.
   The implementation of this architecture has demonstrated that it can be
   successfully deployed using only open-source technologies. Furthermore,
   it has been shown that anyone with access to the campus website can
   access most of the data collected and stored on the system.},

Abstract = {Using Edge Computing approaches is a way to improve the Intelligent
   Transportation Systems (ITS) applications in smart cities. This article
   proposes a case study of an ITS system with a Mobile Edge Computing
   (MEC) architecture using the platform for time-sensitive ITS
   applications. The platform aims to support ITS applications with strict
   requirements for latency and requests loss. We evaluated an ITS
   application in three different scenarios: in the cloud using a 4G
   connection, in the cloud using broadband, and in MEC. We compare
   scenarios using quantitative metrics such as requests per second,
   average response time, and request loss rate. The experimental results
   indicate that MEC has a lower loss of requests and it can work with a
   greater number of requests per second, which makes it a good solution
   for ITS applications.},

   Connected vehicles will be able to provide entertainment content to

   the amount of bandwidth available to the vehicles may not be enough to
   satisfy all of them. In this case, we can say that a conflict of
   interest occurred and then must the solved as fair as possible. In this
   work, we propose a solution to solve this kind of collective conflict.
   Our solution balances users' satisfaction with resources consumption as
   it is capable of choosing the most adequate resolution algorithm based
   on the current application's situation. The results showed that with our
   solution it was possible to achieve adequate satisfaction levels, with

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a technology that is shaping the
   different aspects of human life. In the IoT paradigm objects become
   capable of interact with each other, and with the physical environment
   in which they are inserted without the direct interaction of human
   beings. Several applications are being created for the most diverse
   areas of knowledge, either to solve problems or to make systems more
   efficient. Assistive Technology is a field that is not enough explored
   yet in this context. In this work, an IoT architecture, customized for
   an Electronic Cane (device used by the visually impaired), was
   developed. The five-layer architecture allowed the Electronic Cane to
   act as a gateway, capable of collecting data from IoT devices,
   communicating with a cloud system, that stores, analyzes, and displays
   this data. A prototype was built to validate this architecture, which
   aims to give more autonomy to the visually impaired.},

Abstract = {Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) will be part of our daily
   lives, where new services are bringing novel challenges for smart
   cities. The ITS services rely on vehicular clouds (VC) to aggregate
   tasks from other vehicles to provide cloud services closest to the
   vehicular users. However, the resource and task allocation processes in
   dynamic and mobile environments are still open issues. This paper
   proposes a task optimization mechanism based on the meta-heuristic
   algorithm of the Grey Wolf Optimizer, called TOVEC. It aims to improve
   the usage of the available resources in a VC and maximizing task
   allocation. Simulation results showed that the TOVEC increases the
   number of tasks served by up to 34.2\%, maximizes the use of resources
   by up to 21.5\%, and improves the allocation reward by up to 24.7\%
   compared to Greedy and Dynamic Programming (DP) methods.},

Abstract = {The concentration of population in cities and the increase in the number
   of vehicles on streets pose numerous challenges to urban mobility,
   especially when the possibility of expanding roads is remote and social
   awareness is an obstacle. In this context, this work aims at analyzing
   the performance of routing algorithms in the periodic route planning
   task, in order to identify approaches that maximize quality for
   congestion charge, travel duration, route length, and algorithm
   execution time, considering smart city simulations. The results showed
   that routes with dynamic re-planning jointly with parallelism produced
   an execution time around 30000 times smaller when compared to
   re-planning with serial algorithms. In addition, the parallel approach
   managed to minimize urban mobility metrics when compared to serial
   algorithms results.},

Abstract = {Internet-based technologies such as IoT, GPS-based systems, and cellular
   networks enable the collection of geolocated mobility data of millions
   of people in large metropolitan areas. In addition, large, public
   datasets are made available on the Internet by open government programs,
   providing ways for citizens, NGOs, scientists, and public managers to
   perform a multitude of data analysis with the goal of better
   understanding the city dynamics to provide means for evidence-based
   public policymaking. However, it is challenging to visualize huge
   amounts of data from mobility datasets. Plotting raw trajectories on a
   map often causes data occlusion, impairing the visual analysis.
   Displaying the multiple attributes that these trajectories come with is
   an even larger challenge. One approach to solve this problem is trail
   bundling, which groups motion trails that are spatially close in a
   simplified representation. In this paper, we augment a recent bundling
   technique to support multi-attribute trail datasets for the visual
   analysis of urban mobility. Our case study is based on the travel survey
   from the Sao Paulo Metropolitan Area, which is one of the most intense
   traffic areas in the world. The results show that bundling helps the
   identification and analysis of various mobility patterns for different
   data attributes, such as peak hours, social strata, and transportation
   modes.},

Abstract = {Collecting data is an important task for building smart cities. This
   article proposes SensingBus, a system to collect data from sensors
   carried by urban buses. Using buses to move sensors allows each node to
   cover a wider area, at a negligible cost. SensingBus is based on a
   three-level architecture. At the first level, sensing nodes collect and
   send data to the second level, consisting of fog nodes. The fog nodes
   preprocess data and deliver it to the third level, the cloud
   infrastructure, which stores and makes data externally available. The
   fog infrastructure, on the other hand, discards defective data,
   compresses information, and provides secure access points between the
   fog and the cloud. To validate SensingBus, the authors built a prototype
   and performed experiments to stress the fog nodes. They verified that
   each fog node can serve at least 20 simultaneous sensing nodes, an
   adequate number to sense a city such as Rio de Janeiro.},

Abstract = {Cyber-attacks and threats are growing fast in the Internet of Things
   (IoT) infrastructure as applications in smart cities gain momentum.
   Usually, IoT devices communicate via machine-to-machine protocols such
   as Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Due to the heterogeneous
   structure in IoT and the absence of security by design methodologies,
   security mechanisms in environments with MQTT traffic are needed, and
   they can be deployed as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). This paper
   proposes a Deep Learning (DL) based Network IDS trained using a public
   dataset containing MQTT attacks. We assess the proposal using standard
   performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and
   weighted average. When evaluating the performance of our DL-based
   Network IDS, it obtained, in average, 97.09\% of accuracy and an
   F1-score equal to 98.33\% in the detection of MQTT attacks. Another
   important contribution of our work is the sharing of the experiments on
   GitHub, which guarantees the reproducibility of the research.},

Abstract = {Time series forecasting is an essential task in the management of Smart
   Cities and Smart Grids, becoming even more challenging when it needs to
   deal with big data time series. The development of highly accurate
   machine learning models is yet harder when considering the optimization
   of hyperparameters, which is an expensive computational task. To tackle
   these challenges this work proposes the Distributed Evolutionary
   Hyperparameter Optimization (DEHO) for the Weighted Multivariate Fuzzy
   Time Series method (WMVFTS), a simple and non-parametric forecasting
   method with high scalability and accuracy, comprising a sequential
   training and forecasting procedure and a MapReduce extension for
   distributed processing. The proposed methods were evaluated using a
   cluster with commodity hardware and two big time series, showing
   increasing speed up for training and test times as new CPU cores are
   added to cluster. Then the DEHO method was executed in the computational
   cluster, achieving fast convergence and feasible processing time and
   generating highly accurate WMVFTS models.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is impacting several areas. Using sensors
   and actuators in different contexts, such as smart cities, industry 4.0,
   healthcare, and agriculture, creates new interactions that can only
   occur due to connecting devices. As IoT devices join the military
   domain, new problems arise, like security and authentication in
   unreliable networks. This article proposes a novel approach for
   continuous user authentication to improve wearable device security in
   the Internet of Battle Things (IoBT) context. The proposed approach uses
   a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to directly optimize the embedding
   using the triplet loss. The created embedding represents the authorized
   user gait as a n-dimensional vector and enables comparison with other
   users' gait using a L-2 distance corresponding to a measure of gait
   similarity. The proposed system achieves a 92.12\% rank-1 accuracy on
   user identification and a 12.33\% equal error rate for the user
   validation task.},

Abstract = {More and more, data extracted from social networks is used to build new
   applications and services, such as traffic monitoring platforms,
   identification of epidemic outbreaks, as well as several other
   applications related to the creation of smart cities, for example.
   However, such services are vulnerable to attacks from bots - automatized
   accounts - seeking to tamper statistics of public perception posting an
   excessive number of messages generated automatically. Bots can
   invalidate many existing services, which makes it crucial to understand
   the main forms of attacks and to seek defense mechanisms. This work
   presents a wide characterization of the behavior of bots on Twitter.
   From a real data set containing 19,115 bots, several characteristics of
   bots were identified, extracted from behavior and writing patterns, that
   have discriminative power. From these features, we present an automatic
   detection method capable to detect 92\% of the bots while only less than
   1\% of real users are misclassified.},

   composed of a set of services to video streaming in a fog computing
   environment taking into consideration classified hierarchical tiers and
   the ETSI-NFV architecture. The main goal is to design and assess a
   reliable, high-quality multi-tier services architecture to be used in
   Smart City environments. To this end, we introduce a set of video
   streaming services in the fog-cloud infrastructure, and also discuss how
   these services may be used to improve the Quality of Experience (QoE)
   for end-users.},

Title = {Towards spatiotemporal integration of bus transit with data-driven
   approaches},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNET SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {This study aims to propose an approach for spatiotemporal integration of
   bus transit, which enables users to change bus lines by paying a single
   fare. This could increase bus transit efficiency and, consequently, help
   to make this mode of transit more attractive. Usually, this strategy is
   allowed for a few hours in a non-restricted area; thus, certain walking
   distance areas behave like ``virtual terminals.{''} For that, two
   data-driven algorithms are proposed in this work. First, a new algorithm
   for detecting itineraries based on bus GPS data and the bus stop
   location. The proposed algorithm's results show that 90\% of the
   database detected valid itineraries by excluding invalid markings and
   adding times at missing bus stops through temporal interpolation.
   Second, this study proposes a bus stop clustering algorithm to define
   suitable areas for these virtual terminals where it would be possible to
   make bus transfers outside the physical terminals. Using real-world
   origin-destination trips, the bus network, including clusters, can
   reduce traveled distances by up to 50\%, making twice as many
   connections on average.},

Abstract = {The internet of things (IoT) currently has a large range of
   applications, from wearable to smart cities. Many of these applications
   require that the nodes inside the networks know their relative or
   absolute position. To this end, multiple positioning methods can be
   applied, among such methods are Global Positioning Systems (GPS) or
   methods that employ time delay of arrival (TDOA). This work presents
   node localization methods that employ a dual polarization receiver on a
   single node, or a virtual array when multiple nodes are capable of
   cooperating. The proposed approaches aim to minimize the economic cost
   associated with implementing localization methods, and can be done with
   simple hardware. The accuracy of the proposed methods is measured trough
   a set of numerical simulations.},

Abstract = {Natural disaster management approach establishes stages of prevention,
   preparation, response, and recovery. With the Internet of Things (IoT),
   Bigdata, Business Intelligence, and other Information Communication
   Technologies, data can be gathered to support decisions in stages of the
   response to natural disaster events. In biological natural disasters,
   the ICTs can also support efforts to promote social distancing, public
   health, and economic monitoring to face the threads. S \& atilde;o Paulo
   state used IoT in scenarios to face COVID-19, such as monitoring
   vehicular interurban mobility, social distancing, and economic activity.
   Frameworks, strategies, data views, and use cases are presented to
   support the decision-making process to face this biological natural
   disaster. The data-driven approach supports several purposes, including
   the communication of social distancing indices, economic recovery, the
   progression of contagion, and deaths. It also played a pivotal role in
   fostering transparency initiatives for society and supporting the crisis
   committee by facilitating situational analyses, and this approach became
   standard practice for pandemic response. Studies and innovative
   visualisation perspectives have produced positive outcomes, guiding the
   decision-making process through data analysis. Noteworthy use cases were
   interurban traffic fence monitoring; mapping of virus spreading;
   tracking the economic impact concerning recovery plans; and, evaluating
   the effectiveness of public policies.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) networks are vulnerable to various kinds of
   attacks, being the sinkhole attack one of the most destructive since it
   prevents communication among network devices. In general, existing
   solutions are not effective to provide protection and security against
   attacks sinkhole on IoT, and they also introduce high consumption of
   resources de memory, storage and processing. Further, they do not
   consider the impact of device mobility, which in essential in urban
   scenarios, like smart cities. This paper proposes an intrusion detection
   system, called INTI (Intrusion detection of SiNkhole attacks on 6LoWPAN
   for InterneT of ThIngs), to identify sinkhole attacks on the routing
   services in IoT. Moreover, INTI aims to mitigate adverse effects found
   in IDS that disturb its performance, like false positive and negative,
   as well as the high resource cost. The system combines watchdog,
   reputation and trust strategies for detection of attackers by analyzing
   the behavior of devices. Results show the INTI performance and its
   effectiveness in terms of attack detection rate, number of false
   positives and false negatives.},

Abstract = {The complex urban scenario demands decisions which needs to be taken not
   only fast, but considering a high level of uncertainty. In such context,
   this study proposes an algorithm to address the vehicle allocation
   scheduling with a request list unknown a priori, and is revealed along
   the operation horizon. Based on the OSCO (online stochastic
   combinatorial optimization) problem, it is presented a framework to
   operate such problem in a last-mile delivery system where customers
   requests from e-commerce (or food delivery) along an operations day. The
   deterministic calculation was realized using a permutational flowshop
   scheduling problem with the objective of minimizing makespan.
   Experiments indicated convergence in the algorithm along the planning
   trials, and a satisfactory makespan prediction, before the orders are
   revealed, with accuracy. The probability distribution adheres with a
   bell-shaped (normal) distribution with its population parameters
   estimated using classical statistics inference theory. Incorporating
   uncertain in such type of mathematical modeling could open doors for a
   new era of systems in current days with cloud computing, big data, smart
   cities, and artificial intelligence.},

Abstract = {The use of IoT-related technologies is growing in several areas.
   Applications of environmental monitoring, logistics, smart cities are
   examples of applications that benefit from advances in IoT. In the
   military context, IoT applications can support the decision-making
   process by delivering information collected directly from the
   battlefield to Command, Control, Communications, Computers,
   Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (C4ISR) systems. Taking
   the benefit of the installed IoT network in the battlefield, the use of
   the data collected by the IoT nodes is a way to improve resiliency and
   increase the survivability of networks, as well as to optimize the use
   of available resources. Towards improving the communication network
   present on the battlefield, this work presents a context-aware
   environmental monitoring system that uses real-time battlefield
   information to increase military networks' resilience and survivability.
   The proposed approach is validated by a proof-of-concept experiment. The
   obtained results show that the implementation of this system can improve
   the communication process even when the network is exposed to
   unfavorable climatic factors.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm aims to bring continuous
   interaction between small embedded devices and humans. The IoT has the
   potential to affect our daily lives and bring many benefits to society.
   Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWAN) is a new IoT technology that offers
   long distance connectivity for a massive number of devices. LPWAN is a
   promising solution to enable complex IoT scenarios, such as smart cities
   and smart healthcare. LoRa is currently one of the leading LPWAN
   solutions available for public use. Due to the great number of connected
   devices and, in some cases, sensitive data transmitted in IoT networks,
   security is one of the main concerns in LPWAN. In this paper, we focus
   on the issues of key management in LoRaWAN. We propose a secure
   architecture for key management based on private blockchain and smart
   contracts in order to increase the levels of security and availability
   in LoRaWAN environments. In order to show the feasibility of the
   proposed architecture, a working prototype was implemented using
   open-source tools and commodity hardware.},

Abstract = {Sensor networks have become ubiquitous - being present from personal
   smartphones to smart cities deployments - and are producing large
   volumes of data at increasing rates. Distributed event stream processing
   systems, in its turn, are a specific kind of systems that help us to
   parallelize event processing. Therefore, they provide us capabilities to
   produce quick insights and decisions, in near real-time, on top of
   multiple data streams.
   However, current systems for large scale processing do not focus on
   Internet of Things and Sensor Network workloads, which makes the
   performance decrease quickly as the workload size increases. In order to
   process large scale events with acceptable latency percentiles and high
   throughput, special systems are needed, such as distributed event stream
   processing systems.
   In this work, we propose an architecture for Internet of Things data
   workloads, in a combination of sensor networks data sources and
   distributed event stream processing systems, focused on smart grid data
   profiles. In our evaluations, the system was able to process up to 45K
   messages per second using 8 processing nodes, while providing stable
   latencies for micro-batches above 30 seconds.},

Abstract = {The advent of Smart City and Big Data have generated many data on
   demographical factors, such as health, public transportation, basic
   sanitation, education, among others. However, this growing volume of
   data is little related to their demographic contexts, and when maps
   represent these data, they generally do not have the interactivity to
   allow exploration, either by changing the studied territory, increasing
   or decreasing its scope, relating other data for analysis, visually
   encoding a data, among other possibilities. Thus, this work aims to
   present a system that represents demographic data, specifically in
   geographic maps, and how to make it interactive for the user, presenting
   the software ChoroLibre as a final product: an open-source tool for
   visualizing hierarchical and interactive Choropleth geographic maps for
   the Web. To this end, this paper describes the architecture,
   implementation, methodology, technologies, and the developed
   functionalities of the ChoroLibre tool.},

Abstract = {Smart City is a concept used to describe a city that uses technology in
   order to improve the quality of life in the urban environment. One way
   to contribute to the improvement of urban life is the optimized use of
   resources. Given the high price of gasoline in Brazil and aiming to
   improve the quality of urban life, we developed a mobile application
   that uses fuzzy logic and data read from a OBD-II Bluetooth device (ELM
   327) to classify the driver in regards to the quality of vehicle
   conduction, in order to encourage fuel consumption reduction. The set of
   data to be read was defined by expert knowledge. Results show that is
   possible to estimate instant consumption. Experiments carried out in
   routine traffic situation in Aracaju/SE city have shown an accuracy of
   more than 85\% if compared to the onboard computer information.},

Abstract = {The dynamics between technologies and everyday life is increasingly
   volatile, pushing for greater convenience and ease of both trivial and
   complex processes. A consequence of the wide implementation of Internet
   of Things-based devices in smart city applications clearly reflects the
   mentioned dynamics by the huge amount of data to be handled. To extract
   useful information from such data, a clever approach to conduct data
   analysis is the interdisciplinary one, i.e., engineering and computer
   scientists as close partners of the problem domain experts. This paper
   addresses IoT data of a Public transportation System (PTS) aiming at
   contributing to the data analysis process for new insights about bus
   based PTS applications. Open Data of Curitiba PTS was explored looking
   for approaches to handle and analyze this kind of data, aiming to find
   important information for users, managers and planners of the public
   transport network in Curitiba.},

   Systems (ITSs) due to the increased complexity and dynamism of traffic
   caused by continuous urbanization and population growth. The traditional
   techniques to deal with these challenges are expensive and have a great
   impact on people's lives and, in this scenario, the introduction of
   computational and technological solutions is necessary. In order to
   minimize the problems caused by congestion in urban centers, we present
   Let Me Know, a traffic management system inspired by the communication
   among vehicles that allows the request and availability of information
   related to vehicular traffic. The vehicles request information in order
   to update a distributed database containing momentary analyzes of road
   traffic. Through extensive performance analysis, we show our system's
   ability to reduce traffic congestion with a low impact on the network.},

Abstract = {Social media have been used to extract different types of information.
   The objective of this exploratory research was to investigate the
   characteristics necessary to identify crisis events with social media,
   analyzing the aptitude of messages produced in three crisis events that
   hit cities in the southeastern region of Brazil. In total, 3,042 Twitter
   posts were analyzed based on three essential dimensions for event
   identification: semantic, temporal and geographic information. The
   results show that users actually write messages about urban floods in
   Brazilian cities. However, it is possible to observe differences in
   volume, agility and location properties posted in areas with different
   numbers of populations. In addition, most posts lack information.
   Naturally, this limits the automatic use of these messages. Before
   applying some automatic detection technique, managers can investigate
   the data that circulates in a certain region and employ strategies to
   improve the use of this data.},

Abstract = {In the field of study on smart cities, mapping information using
   Internet of Things (IoT) sensing is necessary because it allows
   optimizing resources through the real-time integration of the consumer
   with the supplier. However, world IoT production capacity would have to
   increase by two orders of magnitude to allow a meaningful level of
   mapping that could be felt in our daily lives. There are several
   technological challenges related to increasing IoT production by two
   orders of magnitude, such as the energy impact we would need to deal
   with. This work aims to introduce the idea that part of these challenges
   could be solved by changing the traditional computational architecture
   to the so-called Neuromorphic, a computational architecture based on
   biological brains. The work consisted of an extensive literature review
   that analyzed data on the specifications of prototypes of Neuromorphic
   architecture devices that were published in scientific databases. As a
   result, it was shown that Neuromorphic devices could meet the
   requirements and solve some challenges related to the increase that the
   world needs in the production of IoT, without the need for long periods
   of technology development.},

Journal = {COMPUTER NETWORKS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {236},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {In the flowering of ubiquitous computing, technologies like the Internet
   of Things and the Internet of Vehicles have contributed to connecting
   objects and sharing location services in broad environments like smart
   cities bringing many benefits to citizens. However, these services yield
   massive and unrestricted mobility data of citizens that pose privacy
   concerns, among them recovering the identity of people with linking
   attacks. Although several privacy mechanisms have been proposed to solve
   anonymization problems, there are few studies about their behavior and
   analysis of the data quality anonymized by these techniques. This paper
   presents an anonymization quality framework for mix-zones enabling
   characterizing and evaluating the impacts of anonymization over time and
   space in mobility data. We conducted experiments with a cab mobility
   dataset and two positioning algorithms to explore one of the
   potentialities of the anonymization quality: elect mix-zones that do not
   consider the traffic but its operating requirements too. The results
   showed that the anonymization quality enabled the selection of mix-zones
   that yield data anonymization considering the quality, privacy, and
   utility analysis. This study is unique because it analyzes mix-zone
   coverage and quality metrics to observe the anonymization quality not
   found in the literature.},

Title = {OffFog: An Approach to Support the Definition of Offloading Policies on
   Fog Computing},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {2022},
Month = {JAN 4},
Abstract = {IoT devices deployed in Smart Cities usually have significant resource
   limitations. For this reason, offload tasks or data to other layers such
   as fog or cloud is regularly adopted to smooth out this issue. Although
   data offloading is a well-known aspect of fog computing, the
   specification of offloading policies is still an open issue due to the
   lack of clear guidelines. Therefore, we propose OffFog-an approach to
   guide the definition of data offloading policies in the context of fog
   computing. In order to evaluate OffFog, we extended the well-known
   simulator iFogSim and conducted an experimental study based on an urban
   surveillance system. The results demonstrated the benefits of
   implementing data offloading based on OffFog recommended policies.
   Furthermore, we identified the best configuration involving design
   decisions such as data compression, data criticality, and storage
   thresholds. The best configuration produced at least 76\% improvement in
   network latency and 5\% in the average execution time compared to the
   iFogSim default strategy. We believe these results represent a
   significant step towards establishing a systematic decision framework
   for data offloading policies in the context of fog computing.},

Abstract = {RDF is being increasingly considered in a broad range of information
   management scenarios. Governments, large corporations, startups, and
   other organizations around the world are using RDF as a data model to
   represent and share knowledge. However, there is still a long
   evolutionary track with multiple challenges for RDF reaching the scale
   of the most recent Big Data intensive applications (e.g., Smart Cities,
   Sensor Networks, eHealth, Internet of Things). In this survey, we review
   the usage of NoSQL databases to the storage of large RDF graphs by
   rehearsing the latest surveys and expanding their findings by updating
   proposals and bringing light to aspects such as model mapping between
   RDF and NoSQL, triple indexing and partitioning, graph fragmentation and
   data caching. Moreover, we explain how the surveyed works extended the
   RDF capabilities so the datasets can benefit of the characteristics of
   scalability, schemaless data, and better overall performance of NoSQL
   databases. The survey summarizes the current state of art, discusses
   open problems, and proposes a Reference Architecture (RA). For the best
   of our knowledge, this is the first survey where the focus is solely on
   papers that use one or more NoSQL systems for the RDF persistence.},

Year = {2018},
Volume = {12},
Number = {5},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {The discovering of patterns regarding how, when, and where users
   interact with mobile applications reveals important insights for mobile
   service providers. In this work, we exploit for the first time a real
   and large-scale dataset representing the records of mobile application
   usage of 5,342 users during 2014. The data was collected by a software
   agent, installed at the users' smartphones, which monitors detailed
   usage of applications. First, we look for general patterns of how users
   access some of the most popular mobile applications in terms of
   frequency, duration, diversity, and data traffic. Next, we mine the
   dataset looking for temporal patterns in terms of when and how often
   accesses occur. Finally, we exploit the location of each access to
   detect users' points of interest and location-based communities. Based
   on the results, we derive a model to generate synthetic datasets of
   mobile application usage and evaluate solutions to predict the next
   application to be launched. We also discuss a series of implications of
   the findings regarding telecommunication services, mobile
   advertisements, and smart cities. This is the first time this dataset is
   used, and we also make it publicly available for other researchers.},

Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is believed to bring new unprecedented
   development to our society and will impact and enable new, more powerful
   applications in many areas. When considering Unmanned Aerial Vehicles
   (UAVs), there is potential to enhance applications in emergency response
   situations, smart cities, industry and others. UAVs are expected to
   provide and consume services as one of the things in the IoT
   environment. However, the intrinsic IoT heterogeneity regarding devices,
   platforms, and communication protocols makes the task of service
   provision and management much harder to be done in the application
   layer. In previous work, we have presented how HAMSTER can enable secure
   service provision using the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT)
   protocol with enhanced security. In this paper, we show how HAMSTER
   deals with service management and exchange with minimum effort from the
   application. We introduce the Service Exchange Operator (SEO) in HAMSTER

Abstract = {The transformation of cities into smarter and more efficient
   environments relies on proactive and timely detection and maintenance of
   city-wide infrastructure, including roadside infrastructure such as road
   signs and the cleaning of illegally dumped rubbish. Currently, these
   maintenance tasks rely predominantly on citizen reports or on-site
   checks by council staff. However, this approach has been shown to be
   time-consuming and highly costly, resulting in significant delays that
   negatively impact communities. This paper presents AIoT-CitySense, an AI
   and IoT-driven city-scale sensing framework, developed and piloted in
   collaboration with a local government in Australia. AIoT-CitySense has
   been designed to address the unique requirements of roadside
   infrastructure maintenance within the local government municipality. A
   tailored solution of AIoT-CitySense has been deployed on existing waste
   service trucks that cover a road network of approximately 100 kms in the
   municipality. Our analysis shows that proactive detection for roadside
   infrastructure maintenance using our solution reached an impressive
   85\%, surpassing the timeframes associated with manual reporting
   processes. AIoT-CitySense can potentially transform various domains,
   such as efficient detection of potholes and precise line marking for
   pedestrians. This paper exemplifies the power of leveraging city-wide
   data using AI and IoT technologies to drive tangible changes and improve
   the quality of city life.},

Title = {Context information sharing for the Internet of Things: A survey},
Journal = {COMPUTER NETWORKS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {166},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) technology is starting to make an impact in a
   wide array of applications, including smart cities and industrial
   environments. Such real-world applications combine computation,
   communication, sensing, and in some cases, actuation, to monitor and
   remotely control the environment. Data is at the core of such real-world
   IoT applications. Analysis, modeling, and reasoning of data are
   necessary to gain valuable insights. Application developers employ
   context-aware systems to translate the data into contextual information,
   which then allows the applications to act cognitively. Context sharing
   platforms offer a solution to distribute context information to those
   who may be interested in it, thus enabling context interoperability
   among different entities. This survey first examines the requirements
   for sharing context information. It then reviews the relevant literature
   for context sharing and classifies them based on their requirements and
   characteristics. Challenges and future directions are presented to
   encourage the development of context sharing platforms. (C) 2019

Title = {A core ontology on the Human-Computer Interaction phenomenon},
Journal = {DATA \& KNOWLEDGE ENGINEERING},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {138},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a complex communication phenomenon
   involving human beings and computer systems that gained large attention
   from industry and academia with the advent of new types of interactive
   systems (mobile applications, smart cities, smart homes, ubiquitous
   systems and so on). Despite of its importance, there is still a lack of
   formal and explicit representations of what the HCI phenomenon is. In
   this paper, we intend to clarify the main notions involved in the HCI
   phenomenon, by establishing an explicit conceptualization of it. To do
   so, we need to understand what interactive computer systems are, which
   types of actions users perform when interacting with an interactive
   computer system, and finally what human-computer interaction itself is.
   The conceptualization is presented as a core reference ontology, called
   HCIO (HCI Ontology), which is grounded in the Unified Foundational
   Ontology (UFO). HCIO was evaluated using ontology verification and
   validation techniques and has been used as core ontology of an HCI
   ontology network.},

Abstract = {Machine to Machine (M2M) a sub area of Internet of Things (IoT) will
   link billions of devices or things distributed around the world using
   the Internet. These devices when connected exchange information obtained
   from the environment such as temperature or humidity from industrial or
   residential control process. Information Security (IS) and Trust are one
   of the fundamental points for users and the industry to accept the use
   of these devices with Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability and
   Authenticity. The key reason is that most of these devices use wireless
   media especially in residential and smart city environments.The overall
   goal of this work is to implement a Middleware Security to improve
   Safety and Security between the control network devices used in IoT/M2M
   and the Internet for residential or industrial environments. This
   implementation has been tested with different protocols as CoAP and
   MQTT, a microcomputer with free Real-Time Operating System (RTOS)
   implemented in a Raspberry Pi Gateway Access Point (RGAP), Network
   Address Translator (NAT), IPTable firewall and encryption is part of
   this implementation for secure data transmission},

Title = {Enhancing a fog-oriented IoT authentication and encryption platform
   through deep learning-based attack detection},
Journal = {INTERNET OF THINGS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {27},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {The term Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network that connects
   smart things with sensors. Healthcare, transportation, and smart cities
   are some IoT applications. IoT technologies integrate objects in the
   cloud-based Internet. The massive scale of IoT exposes some systems to
   attacks. There is an urgent need for solutions that efficiently handle
   IoT authentication, encryption, and attack detection. This work proposes
   a Fog-based IoT security platform named IoTSafe. It contains mechanisms
   for authentication and encryption and a deep learning- based attack
   detection module. The IoTSafe attack detection module uses the Message
   Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Tests were performed to evaluate the
   IoTSafe platform in three different environments. A case study
   demonstrated that the platform is efficient with all proposed mechanisms
   and modules. The results for the attack detection module show the
   proposal's effectiveness with an accuracy of 99.57\% and a precision of
   99.66\%. The IoTSafe time response was less than one second,
   guaranteeing the quality of service.},

Abstract = {Cognitive Radio (CR) is considered a key enabler technology for
   applications that require high connectivity (e.g., Smart Cities and
   Internet of Things), mainly because of its spectrum sensing function. In
   this way, CRs can sense the spectrum environment to select the best
   available channel for communication and they can, potentially, use
   licensed spectrum bands as a Secondary User (SU). However, CR has to
   vacate the licensed spectrum band as soon as a Primary User (PU) intends
   to use the channel. In this way, one of the most challenging topics in
   CR is the PU arrival prediction. Therefore, this paper presents a
   real-data study case of PUs arrivals prediction using the Hidden Markov
   Model (HMM) in CR. Herein, the Energy Detector (ED) is used to detect
   the presence of PUs. Our results show that the traditional method of
   combining the ED with the HMM may not be suitable in CR networks.},

Title = {A Novel Mechanism for Misbehavior Detection in Vehicular Networks},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {68113-68126},
Abstract = {Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) have provided new technologies to
   protect human life, speed up assistance, and improve traffic, to aid
   drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANET)
   are the fundamental elements in an ITS ecosystem. However, its
   characteristics make the system susceptible to numerous attacks, such as
   Denial of Service (DoS). In this paper, we proposed a security system
   based on intrusion detection called Detection of Anomalous Behaviour in
   Smart Conveyance Operations (DAMASCO). We used a statistical approach to
   detect anomalies in vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V). The anomaly
   detection module addresses the Medium Access Control (MAC) sublayer to
   assess the number of packages sent to identify potentially malicious
   nodes, block their activity, and maintain a reputation list. The
   algorithm calculates the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) to identify
   outliers and characteristics of DoS. Our experiments were performed in a
   simulated environment using a realistic urban mobility model. The
   results demonstrate that the proposed security system achieved a 3\%
   false positive rate and no false negatives.},

Abstract = {Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are emerging as a very useful tool
   for gathering, processing, and providing data to vehicles and
   passengers. It is expected that vehicles equipped with a variety of
   sensors will play a determining role in Intelligent Transportation
   System (ITS) and Smart City applications. With the evolution of VANET
   services comes the need for solutions to increase the availability of
   content to users. To this end, we propose a Geo-Localized
   Origin-Destination-based Content Replication (GO-DCR) solution that
   relies on vehicles' origin and destination points to decide which of
   them are more appropriate to replicate content inside a region of
   interest. We compare GO-DCR with two existing solutions through
   extensive simulations, The results show that GO-DCR increases content
   availability and reduces the cost of delivery. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Abstract = {Digital technologies are changing the way people interact with the
   world. The Digital Twin (DT) is one of the key enablers of Industry 4.0.
   It provides a virtual representation of an observable element of the
   real world. These elements can be both physical objects such as devices
   or non-physical such as interactions and processes. Digitalization of
   the real world enables new business models, transforming traditional
   products into services, as for instance, the Car-as-a-Service (CaaS). To
   integrate all components that will be part of systems like CaaS or Smart
   Cities, it is necessary to have well-defined standards for modeling and
   defining an architecture especially taking into consideration the
   granularity level of the system. This paper proposes the main components
   needed for building DT-based systems with different levels of
   granularity. These components have been arranged in layers to specify
   the concerns of each part of the system. A case study has been developed
   to demonstrate the modeling and the deployment of the Digital Twin,
   highlighting how this concept can be one of the key enablers for CaaS.},

Abstract = {Vehicular networks have received much attention in recent years as they
   have emerged as one of the leading data communication solutions for
   smart cities. At the same time, the popularization of sensing devices
   has enabled the acquisition of a vast amount of vehicular mobility data
   (mobility traces). In this sense, a recent trend is to use mobility
   traces to extract hidden knowledge and apply it to improve solutions for
   vehicular networks. In this article, we present and discuss a workflow,
   through a short survey, related to the process of generating mobility
   traces, preprocessing these datasets, and obtaining knowledge to create
   intelligent vehicular networks. We describe the main types of mobility
   data highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. We classify the
   primary methods for obtaining knowledge from mobility data. Also, we
   exemplify how these mobility traces and methods can be applied to
   vehicular networks by reviewing recent contributions. Furthermore, we
   illustrate through a case study how to obtain knowledge from a specific
   type of mobility trace. Finally, we point out new research directions
   that involve mobility traces and intelligent vehicular networks.},

Abstract = {Heterogeneous Vehicular Networks (HetVNETs) are an evolution of the
   traditional Vehicular Networks (VANETs) that integrate long-term and
   short-term communications technologies to deliver strategic services for
   roads and smart cities (for example, Intelligent Transport, Safety
   Notification, Multimedia Content, and others). Despite the recent
   evolution of HetVNETs, points related to security, data integrity and
   privacy are still open issues, since there is no standard to achieve
   trust among the network nodes. A promising approach to achieve trust is
   the usage of a reputation system, that monitors the behavior of network
   nodes to determine its trustworthiness. However, this determination is
   complex, because the uncertainty coming from the HetVNETs features, such
   as fast mobile nodes, self-organization, unstable communication links
   and frequently changing topology. Within this context, this paper
   presents a reputation system for HetVNETs, called TrustV, to perform a
   faster and reliable determination of network nodes trustworthiness based
   on game theory, as well as the long-term and short-term communication
   technologies of HetVNETs. The game theory approach allows TrustV to
   overcome the uncertain issues of HetVNETs, since the modeling of the
   cooperation as a game can identify selfish and malicious nodes during
   the time. The results suggest that the TrustV achieves a very high
   cooperation rate between vehicles at HetVNETs, even as it is capable to
   detect selfish and malicious nodes as well as black hole and grey hole
   attacks.},

Abstract = {Pervasive connectivity is an essential underlying substrate for smart
   cities, leading municipalities to start programs where Wi-Fi is the
   fundamental building block to develop public Municipal Wireless
   Networks. Even though hundreds of cities around the world offer some
   form of Wi-Fi access, there are no widely available results regarding
   the network Quality of Service (QoS), user Quality of Experience (QoE),
   and overall utilization profile. The Municipality of Sao Paulo operates
   a free Wi-Fi Internet program in 120 public spaces called digital
   squares. We collected user connection data, network performance, and
   service availability for more than 2 years from the 120 squares and
   undertook experiments with video streaming in five squares. We used this
   unique large dataset to evaluate the impact of current admission control
   practices in public Wi-Fi networks on the network QoS, user QoE and
   service availability, also providing insights into the most common
   QoS/QoE issues and their causes. We also leveraged the data set to
   establish and verify a correlation between the number of users access in
   the network and specific events occurring in the area.},

Abstract = {Agent-based Internet of Things (IoT) applications have recently emerged
   as applications that can involve sensors, wireless devices, machines and
   software that can exchange data and be accessed remotely. Such
   applications have been proposed in several domains including health
   care, smart cities and agriculture. However, despite their increased
   adoption, deploying these applications in specific settings has been
   very challenging because of the complex static and dynamic variability
   of the physical devices such as sensors and actuators, the software
   application behavior and the environment in which the application is
   embedded. In this paper, we propose a modeling approach for IoT
   analytics based on learning embodied agents (i.e. situated agents). The
   approach involves: (i) a variability model of IoT embodied agents; (ii)
   feedback evaluative machine learning; and (iii) reconfiguration of a
   group of agents in accordance with environmental context. The proposed
   approach advances the state of the art in that it facilitates the
   development of Agent-based IoT applications by explicitly capturing
   their complex and dynamic variabilities and supporting their
   self-configuration based on an context-aware and machine learning-based
   approach.},

Journal = {FUTURE INTERNET},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The amalgamation of Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) with the Internet
   of Things (IoT) leads to the concept of the Internet of Vehicles (IoV).
   IoV forms a solid backbone for Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS),
   which paves the way for technologies that better explain about traffic
   efficiency and their management applications. IoV architecture is seen
   as a big player in different areas such as the automobile industry,
   research organizations, smart cities and intelligent transportation for
   various commercial and scientific applications. However, as VANET is
   vulnerable to various types of security attacks, the IoV structure
   should ensure security and efficient performance for vehicular
   communications. To address these issues, in this article, an
   authentication-based protocol (A-MAC) for smart vehicular communication
   is proposed along with a novel framework towards an IoV architecture
   model. The scheme requires hash operations and uses cryptographic
   concepts to transfer messages between vehicles to maintain the required
   security. Performance evaluation helps analyzing its strength in
   withstanding various types of security attacks. Simulation results
   demonstrate that A-MAC outshines other protocols in terms of
   communication cost, execution time, storage cost, and overhead.},

Title = {DG2CEP: a near real-time on-line algorithm for detecting spatial
   clusters large data streams through complex event processing},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INTERNET SERVICES AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {10},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Spatial concentrations (or spatial clusters) of moving objects, such as
   vehicles and humans, is a mobility pattern that is relevant to many
   applications. Fast detection of this pattern and its evolution, e.g., if
   the cluster is shrinking or growing, is useful in numerous scenarios,
   such as detecting the formation of traffic jams or detecting a fast
   dispersion of people in a music concert. On-Line detection of this
   pattern is a challenging task because it requires algorithms that are
   capable of continuously and efficiently processing the high volume of
   position updates in a timely manner. Currently, the majority of
   approaches for spatial cluster detection operate in batch mode, where
   moving objects location updates are recorded during time periods of a
   certain length and then batch-processed by an external routine, thus
   delaying the result of the cluster detection until the end of the time
   period. Further, they extensively use spatial data structures and
   operators, which can be troublesome to maintain or parallelize in
   on-line scenarios. To address these issues, in this paper we propose
   DG2CEP, a parallel algorithm that combines the well-known density-based
   clustering algorithm DBSCAN with the data stream processing paradigm
   Complex Event Processing (CEP) to achieve continuous and timely
   detection of spatial clusters. Our experiments with real-world data
   streams indicate that DG2CEP is able to detect the formation and
   dispersion of clusters with small latency while having higher similarity
   to DBSCAN than batch-based approaches.},

Abstract = {Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) networks are a promising solution
   for Internet of Things (IoT) applications that require low power
   consumption and long-range coverage. These wireless networks enable data
   transmission between IoT devices and gateways, which are responsible for
   capturing and relaying messages to a server. However, LoRaWAN network
   planning involves complex issues, such as determining the number and
   positioning of gateways, which can impact data transmission efficiency.
   In this context, this work introduces LoRaWAN IoT Simulation and
   Optimization Environment Planning (LoRaWISEP) - a Software as a Service
   (SaaS) designed to assist LoRaWAN network planning through simulations
   that enable the quantification and positioning of gateways. LoRaWISEP is
   characterized as a Decision Support tool, aiding in the design of
   LoRaWAN network infrastructure. The system is developed based on Design
   Thinking, encompassing stages of immersion, ideation, prototyping, and
   development to ensure the software meets user needs and offers suitable
   usability. The study is characterized as a descriptive and qualitative
   approach. Consequently, the proposed tool can assist in LoRaWAN network
   planning with an interface that allows easy configuration of parameters,
   such as the selection of quantification and gateway positioning
   algorithms. Additionally, the system provides performance results, such
   as Packet Delivery Rate (PDR), which can be used to evaluate network
   performance. Therefore, LoRaWISEP facilitates LoRaWAN network planning,
   significantly contributing to the allocation of IoT devices in various
   scenarios, including smart cities and precision agriculture, which
   benefits the scientific community and professionals working with
   LoRaWAN.},

Abstract = {Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) allows monitoring and automation
   in diverse contexts, such as hospitals, homes, or even smart cities,
   just to name a few examples. IoT data processing may occur, at the edge
   of the network or in the cloud, but frequently the processing must be
   divided between the two layers. Aiming to guarantee that the IoT systems
   works efficiently, it is essential to evaluate the system even in
   initial design stages. However, evaluating hybrid systems composed by
   multiple layers is not an easy task as a myriad of parameters are
   involved in the process. Thus, this paper presents two SPN models (one
   base and extended one) that can represent an abstract distributed system
   composed of IoT, edge and cloud layers. The models are highly
   configurable to be used in diverse simulation scenarios. Besides a
   sensitivity analysis evidenced the most impacting components in the
   studied architecture and made it possible to optimize the base SPN
   model. Finally a case study explores multiple metrics of interest
   concurrently and works as a guide of the model utilization. Ultimately,
   the proposed approach can assist system designers to avoid unnecessary
   investment in original equipment.},

Abstract = {Sensors are being extensively deployed and are expected to expand at
   significant rates in the coming years. They typically generate a large
   volume of data on the internet of things (IoT) application areas like
   smart cities, intelligent traffic systems, smart grid, and e-health.
   Cloud, edge and fog computing are potential and competitive strategies
   for collecting, processing, and distributing IoT data. However, cloud,
   edge, and fog-based solutions need to tackle the distribution of a high
   volume of IoT data efficiently through constrained and limited resource
   network infrastructures. This paper addresses the issue of conveying a
   massive volume of IoT data through a network with limited communications
   resources (bandwidth) using a cognitive communications resource
   allocation based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) with SARSA algorithm.
   The proposed network infrastructure (PSIoTRL) uses a Publish/Subscribe
   architecture to access massive and highly distributed IoT data. It is
   demonstrated that the PSIoTRL bandwidth allocation for buffer flushing
   based on SARSA enhances the IoT aggregator buffer occupation and network
   link utilization. The PSIoTRL dynamically adapts the IoT aggregator
   traffic flushing according to the Pub/Sub topic's priority and network
   constraint requirements.},

Abstract = {Blockchain technology has been applied to various applications (e.g.,
   smart buildings and smart cities) that typically run in an environment
   of smart devices, known as Internet-of-Things (IoT). To support these
   applications, different blockchain architectures, data structures and
   consensus algorithms have been proposed, tailored to IoT. One such
   proposal, appendable-block blockchain, is a promising blockchain
   framework for use in IoT environments. It provides a scalable data
   structure that allows parallel insertions between independent nodes.
   However, it has some limitations, in particular related to the possible
   eclipse attack by malicious gateways and the lack of consensus for
   transactions insertion. To solve these issues, we propose a new
   consensus mechanism for appendable-block blockchains, called
   context-based consensus. Using context-based consensus, information can
   be inserted in parallel across devices (called context) while ensuring
   that light-weight consensus is performed to guarantee that a transaction
   is well-formed and it is placed in the correct order. We implemented
   context-based consensus and show that using multiple contexts reduces
   latency and increases the throughput of transaction insertions when
   compared to consensus without contexts or using single transaction
   consensus.},

Title = {BikeWay: A Multi-Sensory Fuzzy-Based Quality Metric for Bike Paths and
   Tracks in Urban Areas},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Abstract = {Large cities are increasingly investing in efficient mobility and
   sustainable transportation as an alternative to expensive and pollutant
   traditional vehicles. In parallel, people are also seeking cleaner and
   healthier options for short and last-mile distances. In order to cope
   with this trend, which has boosted the adoption of bikes in urban areas,
   a major concern of the governments has been to build bike paths and
   tracks that allow cyclists to move safely and through shorter distances.
   However, such initiatives may result in bicycles infrastructure built
   alongside traditional vehicular roads or on inadequate regions.
   Therefore, there should be a flexible way to assess the quality of bike
   paths and tracks, combining variables that indicate adverse conditions
   for the health and safety of cyclists, such as statistical risk of
   accidents, air and noise pollution, excessive sunlight exposure,
   dangerous UV radiation, among others. This article then proposes a new
   comprehensive quality metric that combines sensed environmental data and
   historical reported incidents related to bike paths and tracks, which
   may be employed for traditional physical signaling or to support
   computer-assisted solutions for cycling monitoring and alerting. Such
   new metric exploits fuzzy logic to model a group of variables to
   ultimately provide a unified safety and health quality level, referred
   as BikeWay. Doing so, we expect to allow dynamic and historical
   perceptions of how healthy and safe the bike paths and tracks are for
   cyclists in modern cities.},

Abstract = {Automated license plate recognition (ALPR) technology is a powerful
   technology enabling more efficient and effective law enforcement,
   security, payment collection, and research. A common license plate
   standard was adopted by the member states of the Mercosur trading bloc
   (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) and consequently requires an
   upgrade to the ALPR software used by law enforcement and industry. Due
   to the scarcity of real license plate images, training state-of-the-art
   supervised detectors is unfeasible unless data augmentation techniques
   and synthetic training data are used. This paper presents an accurate
   and efficient automated Mercosur license plate detector using a
   Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained exclusively with synthetic
   imagery. In order to obtain the synthetic training data, Mercosur
   license plates were faithfully reproduced. Digital image processing
   techniques were employed to reduce the domain gap and a CNN with basic
   image manipulation was used to embed the artificial licensed plates in
   to realistic contexts. The trained model was then validated on real
   images captured from a parking lot and a publicly available traffic
   monitoring video stream. The results of experiments suggest detection
   accuracy of about 95\% and an average running time of 40 milliseconds.},

Abstract = {Emerging Web applications based on distributed IoT sensor systems and
   machine intelligence, such as in smart city scenarios, have posed many
   challenges to network and processing infrastructures. For example,
   environment monitoring cameras generate massive data streams to
   event-based applications that require fast processing for immediate
   actions. Finding a missing person in public spaces is an example of
   these applications, since his/her location is a piece of perishable
   information. Recently, the integration of edge computing with machine
   intelligence has been explored as a promising strategy to interpret such
   massive data near the sensor and reduce the end-to-end latency of
   processing events. However, due to the limited capacity and
   heterogeneity of edge resources, the placement of task processing is not
   trivial, especially when applications have different quality of service
   (QoS) requirements. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to solve the
   optimization problem of allocating a set of nodes with sufficient
   processing capacity to execute a pipeline of tasks while minimizing the
   operational cost related to latency and energy and maximizing
   availability. We compare our algorithm with the resource allocation
   algorithms (first-fit, best-fit, and worst-fit), achieving a lower cost
   in scenarios with different nodes' heterogeneity. We also demonstrate
   that distributing processing across multiple edge nodes reduces latency
   and energy consumption and still improves availability compared to
   processing only in the cloud.},

Abstract = {Open Government Data has been made available by public institutions in
   Brazil and the world, and can add value to various sectors of society.
   Open data is also linked to smart cities, and hence important in this
   context, as it is the first step towards public transparency. Despite
   the wide range of Open Government Data, interpreting such data sets is a
   non-trivial task, due to the massive amount of raw data. This stimulates
   the search for techniques and methodologies that allow the
   interpretation of implicit information and deduction of new knowledge.
   One of the approaches used for these tasks involves the use of data
   visualizations. In addition to data visualizations classically used in
   descriptive statistics for data analysis, such as line or bar charts,
   many web sites have been used map visualization techniques. This type of
   visualization is important, since visualization of georeferenced data
   combined with other types of information can aid its interpretation.
   However, for data visualization construction on maps, it is necessary
   that the objects to be visualized are georeferenced. There are standards
   for turning such data available, however they are diverse, which may
   make it difficult for a single tool to display views from different
   sources. This work aims to present a framework that defines data
   standards for constructing data visualizations on maps of various types.
   Based on this framework, a tool was implemented to facilitate the
   creation of different map views, both by developers of open data portals
   and by users who analyze such data.},

Title = {A Systematic Literature Review on the Use of Federated Learning and
   Bioinspired Computing},
Journal = {ELECTRONICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {13},

Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Federated learning (FL) and bioinspired computing (BIC), two distinct,
   yet complementary fields, have gained significant attention in the
   machine learning community due to their unique characteristics. FL
   enables decentralized machine learning by allowing models to be trained
   on data residing across multiple devices or servers without exchanging
   raw data, thus enhancing privacy and reducing communication overhead.
   Conversely, BIC draws inspiration from nature to develop robust and
   adaptive computational solutions for complex problems. This paper
   explores the state of the art in the integration of FL and BIC,
   introducing BIC techniques and discussing the motivations for their
   integration with FL. The convergence of these fields can lead to
   improved model accuracy, enhanced privacy, energy efficiency, and
   reduced communication overhead. This synergy addresses inherent
   challenges in FL, such as data heterogeneity and limited computational
   resources, and opens up new avenues for developing more efficient and
   autonomous learning systems. The integration of FL and BIC holds promise
   for various application domains, including healthcare, finance, and
   smart cities, where privacy-preserving and efficient computation is

Title = {Generation of irregular grid maps for fingerprinting-based mobile radio
   localization using farthest-first traversal and low-discrepancy
   sequences},
Journal = {COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS},

Abstract = {Localization techniques play a fundamental role in various applications
   like in the development of smart cities, making the improvement of such
   technologies indispensable. In this context, radio frequency (RF)
   fingerprinting (FP)-based localization methods are attractive due to
   their lower implementation cost, lower energy consumption, and better
   performance in non-line-of-sight conditions compared to GPS. With this
   in mind, we propose an RF FP-based localization method using an
   irregular grid map generation strategy. The grid map segmentation
   procedure is based on the assumption that the RF measurements collected
   in a region carry information on how users are often spatially
   distributed. The algorithms employed in the irregular grid map
   generation are the farthest-first traversal and low-discrepancy
   R-sequence. Different irregular grid map generators are compared with
   each other and with the regular grid map. We evaluate the generators in
   two different scenarios: with measurements obtained through simulation
   with ns-3 and via a driving-test procedure in an urban area. Numerical
   results indicate that our proposed irregular generator presents a lower
   localization error in both scenarios and is the only one capable of
   meeting one of the accuracy requirements stated by the Federal
   Communications Commission that demands a localization error of up to 50
   m in 80\% of the emergency calls.},

Title = {w2v-SELD: A Sound Event Localization and Detection Framework for
   Self-Supervised Spatial Audio Pre-Training},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {181553-181569},
Abstract = {Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) is a critical challenge in
   various industrial applications, such as autonomous systems, smart
   cities, and audio surveillance, which require accurate identification
   and localization of sound events in complex environments. Traditional
   supervised approaches heavily rely on large, annotated multichannel
   audio datasets, which are expensive and time-consuming to produce. This
   paper addresses this limitation by introducing the w2v-SELD
   architecture, a self-supervised model adapted from the wav2vec 2.0
   framework to learn effective sound event representations directly from
   raw, unlabeled 3D audio data in ambisonics format. The proposed model
   follows a two-stage process: pre-training on large, unlabeled 3D audio
   datasets to capture high-level features, followed by fine-tuning with a
   smaller, labeled SELD dataset. Experimental results show that our
   w2v-SELD method outperforms baseline models on Detection and
   Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) challenges,
   achieving a 66\% improvement for DCASE TAU-2019 and a 57\% improvement
   on DCASE TAU-2020 with respect to baseline systems. The w2v-SELD model
   performs competitively with state-of-the-art supervised methods,
   highlighting its potential to significantly reduce the dependency on
   labeled data in industrial SELD applications. The code and pre-trained
   parameters of our w2v-SELD model are available online.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF SENSOR AND ACTUATOR NETWORKS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {8},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {With the increase of population density and the rural exodus to cities,
   urbanization is assuming extreme proportions and presents a tremendous
   urban problem related to waste generation. The increase of waste
   generation has been considered a significant challenge to large urban
   centers worldwide and represents a critical issue for countries with
   accelerated population growth in cities. The Internet of Things (IoT)
   and cloud computing offer an automation possibility through
   cyberphysical systems that will change the way solid waste management is
   performed. Considering IoT requirements, a review analysis of waste
   management models available in the literature is performed in detail in
   this paper. Then, a deep review is undertaken of the related literature
   based on IoT infrastructure for efficient handling of waste generated in
   urban scenarios, focusing on the interaction among concessionaires and
   waste generators (citizens) from the perspective of a shorter collection
   time with reduced costs, as well as citizenship promotion. An IoT-based
   reference model is described, and a comparison analysis of the available
   solutions is presented, with the goal to highlight the most relevant
   approaches and identify open research issues on the topic.},

Title = {A Conformance Testing Methodology and System for Cognitive Radios},
Journal = {WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS \& MOBILE COMPUTING},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {2021},
Month = {JAN 29},
Abstract = {The fifth generation (5G) of mobile networks has started its operation
   in some countries and is aimed at meeting demands beyond the current
   system capabilities such as the huge amount of connected devices from
   IoT applications (e.g., smart cities), explosive growth of high-speed
   mobile data traffic (e.g., ultrahigh definition video streaming), and
   ultrareliable and low latency communication (e.g., autonomous vehicle).
   To attend to these needs, the electromagnetic spectrum must be made
   available, but the static spectrum allocation policy has caused a
   spectrum shortage and impaired the employment/expansion of the wireless
   systems. To overcome this issue, the dynamic spectrum access (DSA) has
   been promoted in 5G/6G networks, which is enabled by the cognitive radio
   (CR) technology. Although diverse mechanisms have been developed to
   tackle the challenges that emerge in different CR
   layers/functionalities, a standardized testing methodology and system
   for CR is still immature. Existing standards or methodologies and
   systems for CR only focus on the definition of network technologies
   (e.g., IEEE 802.22 and IEEE 802.11af), performance evaluation of CR
   algorithms/mechanisms, or definition of the device cognition level via
   performance results or psychometric approaches, not covering
   systems/methodologies to verify if the device meets the CR capabilities
   and regulatory policies, neglecting the conformance testing. In this
   respect, this paper proposes a flexible methodology and system for CR
   conformance testing under two perspectives, functionalities and limits.
   We instantiate it by using the Universal Software Radio Peripheral
   (USRP) software-defined radio platform and present a proof-of-concept
   with a conformance metric. The results show the feasibility of our
   proposal.},

Abstract = {Context: With the growth of smart cities, surveillance camera systems
   have increased their monitoring capacity in different environments. In
   public Universities, monitoring requires subtle and precise alerts, in
   order to curb actions that may present a lack of security for the
   academic community. Problem: Although the detection objects in videos is
   possible, the high cost of acquiring, installing high-quality cameras
   and machines capable of executing high-precision models of customized
   solutions is expensive. In addition, most solutions achieve high
   precision in controlled environments, with high resolution still images,
   and focus on objects, which does not portray the reality of surveillance
   cameras in Universities. Solution: Faced with this problem, the
   objective is to build a Automatic License Plate Recognition system(ALPR)
   to control vehicles entering and leaving Universities. It is proposed to
   interoperate with camera systems in order to alert the competent
   authorities. Information systems theory: This work was conceived under
   the General Theory of Systems with regard to interoperate with already
   existing heterogeneous systems. Furthermore, as part of the theory of
   socio-technical systems, this approach aims to improve the performance
   of the organization, offering improvements in the productivity of the
   task due to the alerts of the offered approach. Method: This research is
   descriptive and its evaluation is done through proof of concept.
   Results: The artifact developed showed good performance, allowing to
   recognize license plates in surveillance cameras with 76.6\% accuracy.
   Contributions and Impact in the area of information systems: Our main
   contribution is the artifact to detect vehicles. A secondary
   contribution is our dataset with Old and Mercosul Plaques versions. Such
   method impacts the three pilars from IS area: People, Process and
   Technology.},

   monitoring capabilities to prevent malicious behaviors without
   prohibiting people's circulation. Problem: Universities have large
   parking lots with many vehicles and face daily security problems, such
   as robberies and kidnappings, due to the lack of cameras capable of
   detecting suspicious behavior and alerting security personnel. Solution:
   Our approach enhances security in the university environment by
   developing a system capable of recognizing vehicles and individuals,
   assessing their proximity, and detecting gestures and actions labeled as
   suspicious behavior while interoperating with camera systems to alert
   the appropriate security authorities. Information systems theory: This
   work was conceived based on the General System Theory to interact with
   pre-existing heterogeneous systems. It relates to the Technological
   Frames of Reference theory, which involves the perception and
   interpretation of real-time object detection technology to monitor,
   alert, and ensure security. Method: Our research method is an
   experimental, descriptive investigation of collecting quantitative data,
   and our evaluation is conducted through the proof of concept. Results:
   Our artifact demonstrated its feasibility by exhibiting good
   performance, enabling the detection of pre-defined suspicious behaviors
   near vehicles with a precision of 94,25\% and accuracy of 86,99\%.
   Contributions and Impact in the area of information systems: Our
   contributions are two-fold: From the organization's perspective, our
   security system interoperability, generating interoperable alerts; the
   artifact to detect suspicious behaviors, protecting people in the
   University environment. Our approach impacts the three pilars from IS
   area: People, Process and Technology. Additionally, we provide a dataset
   of security camera videos in university parking lots.},

Abstract = {Edge computing (EC) is a promising technology capable of bridging the
   gap between Cloud computing services and the demands of emerging
   technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Most EC-based
   solutions, from wearable devices to smart cities architectures, benefit
   from Machine Learning (ML) methods to perform various tasks, such as
   classification. In these cases, ML solutions need to deal efficiently
   with a huge amount of data, while balancing predictive performance,
   memory and time costs, and energy consumption. The fact that these data
   usually come in the form of a continuous and evolving data stream makes
   the scenario even more challenging. Many algorithms have been proposed
   to cope with data stream classification, e.g., Very Fast Decision Tree
   (VFDT) and Strict VFDT (SVFDT). Recently, Online Local Boosting
   (OLBoost) has also been introduced to improve predictive performance
   without modifying the underlying structure of the decision tree produced
   by these algorithms. In this work, we compared the four-way relationship
   among time efficiency, energy consumption, predictive performance, and
   memory costs, tuning the hyperparameters of VFDT and the two versions of
   SVFDT with and without OLBoost. Experiments over 6 benchmark datasets
   using an EC device revealed that VFDT and SVFDT-I were the most
   energy-friendly algorithms, with SVFDT-I also significantly reducing
   memory consumption. OLBoost, as expected, improved the predictive
   performance, but caused a deterioration in memory and energy
   consumption.},

Title = {A Survey on Monitoring Quality Assessment for Wireless Visual Sensor
   Networks},
Journal = {FUTURE INTERNET},
Year = {2022},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Wireless visual sensor networks have been adopted in different contexts
   to provide visual information in a more flexible and distributed way,
   supporting the development of different innovative applications.
   Although visual data may be central for a considerable set of
   applications in areas such as Smart Cities, Industry 4.0, and Vehicular
   Networks, the actual visual data quality may be not easily determined
   since it may be associated with many factors that depend on the
   characteristics of the considered application scenario. This entails
   several aspects from the quality of captured images (sharpness,
   definition, resolution) to the characteristics of the networks such as
   employed hardware, power consumption, and networking efficiency. In
   order to better support quality analysis and performance comparisons
   among different wireless visual sensor networks, which could be valuable
   in many monitoring scenarios, this article surveys this area with
   special concern on assessment mechanisms and quality metrics. In this
   context, a novel classification approach is proposed to better
   categorize the diverse applicable metrics for quality assessment of
   visual monitoring procedures. Hence, this article yields a practical
   guide for analyzing different visual sensor network implementations,
   allowing fairer evaluations and comparisons among a variety of research
   works. Critical analysis are also performed regarding the relevance and
   usage of the proposed categories and identified quality metrics.
   Finally, promising open issues and research directions are discussed in
   order to guide new developments in this research field.},

Abstract = {The recently coined Internet of Things (loT) paradigm leverages a large
   volume of heterogeneous Network Elements (NEs) demanding broad
   connectivity anywhere, anytime and anyhow, fueling the deployment of
   innovative Internet services, such as Cloud or Fog Computing, Data
   Center Networks (DCN5), Smart Cities or Smart Transportation. The proper
   deployment of these novel Internet services is imposing hard
   connectivity constraints, such as high transmission capacity, reliable
   communications, as well as an efficient control scheme capable of
   enabling an agile coordination of actions in large heterogeneous
   scenarios. In recent years, novel control schemes, such as the so-called
   Path Computation Element (PCE) has gained momentum in the network
   research community turning into real PCE implementations. Indeed, there
   is a wealth of studies assessing the PCE performance, clearly showing
   the potential benefits of decoupling routing control tasks from the
   forwarding nodes. Nevertheless, recognized the need for a control
   solution in IoT scenarios, there is not much published information
   analyzing PCE benefits in these loT scenarios. In this paper, we distill
   how the PCE may gracefully provide for service composition in an agile
   manner, handling the specific constraints and requirements found in loT
   scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel PCE strategy referred to as
   Service Oriented PCE (SPCE), which enables network-aware service
   composition. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

   Wireless Visual Sensor Networks},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},

Volume = {8},
Pages = {109568-109580},
Abstract = {Wireless visual sensor networks are commonly employed on several
   applications contexts such as smart cities, intelligent transportation
   systems and industrial management, aiming at the use of visual data from
   cameras to provide enhanced information and to expand the networks
   utilities. In these scenarios, some applications may require
   high-definition images when performing more specialized tasks, for
   example in face and text recognition, adding an important monitoring
   requirement when using camera-based sensors. In fact, it is important to
   ensure that the network is able to gather visual data with the
   associated required quality to each task, and such perceived quality may
   be processed as a function of the Field of View (FoV) of the visual
   sensors. In order to address this issue, new quality metrics are
   proposed for wireless visual sensor networks that are deployed to
   perform area coverage, exploiting for that different perceptions of the
   FoV. Those metrics are proposed along with redeployment optimization
   methods for visual sensor nodes aiming at the improvement of the
   perceived monitoring quality, which are based on greedy and
   evolutionary-based approaches. The proposed metrics and algorithms are
   expected to be more realistic than previous solutions, allowing flexible
   processing of variables as cameras \& x2019; positions, orientations and
   viewing angles, providing then high flexibility on the definition of
   parameters and significantly contributing to the development of sensor
   networks based on visual sensors.},

Abstract = {Recent advances in sensor technologies and instrumentation have led to
   an extraordinary growth of data sources and streaming applications. A
   wide variety of devices, from smart phones to dedicated sensors, have
   the capability of collecting and streaming data at unprecedented rates.
   Typical applications include smart cities \& built environments for
   instance, where sensor-based infrastructures continue to increase in
   scale and variety. Analysis of stream data involves: (i) execution of a
   number of operations on a time/sample window - e.g. min./max./avg.,
   filtering, etc; (ii) a need to combine a number of such operations
   together; (iii) event-driven execution of operations, generally over
   short time durations; (iv) operation correlations across multiple data
   streams. The use of such operations does not fit well in the per-hour or
   per-minute cloud billing models currently available from cloud providers
   - with some notable exceptions (e.g. Amazon AWS). In this paper we
   discuss how microbilling and sub-second resource allocation can be used
   in the context of streaming applications and how micro-billing models
   bring challenges to capacity management on cloud infrastructures.},

Title = {LoRaWAN vs. 6TiSCH: Which one scales better?},
Journal = {COMPUTER COMMUNICATIONS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {184},
Pages = {1-11},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has been a hot topic in both academia and
   industry for the last few years. There are many possible applications,
   in fields as smart cities, home automation, smart buildings,
   agriculture, automated metering, logistic, industrial automation, among
   others. Such a wide range of applications resulted in various
   technological solutions in order to enable Machine-to-Machine (M2M)
   communications, in which we highlight those for wide area networks. In
   that sense, two widely used sub-GHz protocols for Low Power Wide Area
   (LPWA) communications are: Long Range (LoRa), using the upper layers
   defined by Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN); and IEEE 802.15.4g,
   using the upper layers defined by IPv6 over the Time-Slotted Channel
   Hopping (TSCH) mode of IEEE 802.15.4e (6TiSCH). While LoRaWAN is a
   well-known and widespread protocol, 6TiSCH offers IPv6 connectivity to
   LPWA networks and is used in important standards such as Wireless Smart
   Ubiquitous Network (Wi-SUN). This paper aims at determining how well
   each protocol scales, analyzing different aspects such as packet loss,
   delay, and the maximum number of nodes per square area. In order to
   achieve such results, computer simulations are performed using
   open-source simulators. The obtained results demonstrate that the best
   scalability depends on which scenarios are considered. For scenarios
   with multiple gateways requiring low latency or low packet transmission
   rates, LoRaWAN demonstrates better results. However, in scenarios with
   high packet transmission rates and where the latency is not a major
   concern, 6TiSCH is more appropriate. Moreover, even in the best case,
   the latency associated with the LoRaWAN technology may be considerably
   smaller than associated with 6TiSCH. Such novelty results are obtained
   in a fair and realistic way and, noting that both technologies could be
   used to build LPWA networks, it can help system designers to decide
   between the two technologies.},

Title = {FOCUSeR: A Fog Online Context-Aware Up-to-Date Sensor Ranking Method},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF SENSOR AND ACTUATOR NETWORKS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Data obtained from sensors connected to wireless sensor networks must be
   stored and processed to enable environments such as smart cities.
   However, with the exponential growth in the number of devices at the
   edge of the network, it is necessary to implement robust techniques,
   capable of selecting reliable data sources and meeting low latency
   requirements, in order to serve critical applications. Thus, to overcome
   these challenges, this research work presents FOCUSeR, a method for
   ranking sensors. The method uses the evaluation of data as a criterion
   for the ranking, allowing us to identify occurrences of failures in
   sensors and anomalies in environments. In order to meet the requirements
   inherent to WSNs, the proposed method was developed to run in a fog
   computing environment, using online learning and constant updating over
   time to avoid effects such as time drift. The generated ranking lists
   are managed through distributed hash tables. To provide reliability to
   the experimental results, a real experimental environment was developed.
   Moreover, using this developed testbed, a dataset with labels was
   created, to support the evaluation of the method. In addition, four
   other real datasets were used, three of which were labeled through
   artificial fault injection. These datasets were labeled in a related
   work that focused on injecting artificial faults. The experimental
   results obtained demonstrate that the proposed approach can provide
   reliability in the use of sensor data, using low computational resources
   and reducing latency in the sensor selection process. Precision rates
   are approximately 98\% and Accuracy rates are greater than 94\% across
   all datasets. In addition, the analyses carried out show that the
   Accuracy has an increasing rate as the number of samples also increases.
   Results obtained in the failure data recovery also demonstrate the
   feasibility of the proposal in this resource.},

Title = {Metropolitan optical networks: A survey on single-layer architectures},
Journal = {OPTICAL SWITCHING AND NETWORKING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {47},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Metropolitan optical networks are undergoing significant transformations
   to continue being able to provide services that meet the requirements of
   the applications of the future. The current deployment of the 5G
   networks and the envisioned 6G cyber-physical systems would expand the
   possibilities for offering IoT applications, autonomous vehicles, and
   smart city services while imposing strong pressure on the physical
   infrastructure. In order to guarantee the strictest quality of service
   and quality of experience requirements for users, new architectures have
   been proposed in the literature for metropolitan optical networks, with
   a growing interest in the last five years. However, due to the
   proliferation of a dozen new architectures in the last years, many
   questions need to be investigated regarding the planning,
   implementation, and management of these architectures, before they could
   be considered for practical application. This work presents a
   comprehensive survey of the new proposed single-layer (purely optical)
   architectures for metropolitan optical networks. First, we discuss the
   structural organization of the new metro ecosystems. Second, the already
   established and novel architectures are presented, highlighting their
   characteristics and application. Third, we carry out a comparative
   analysis of these architectures to identify future technological trends.
   Finally, we have drawn outstanding research questions to help direct
   future research in the field.},

Abstract = {The widespread adoption of 5G cellular technology is becoming the major
   driver for the growth of IoT-based applications. In this paper we
   consider a Mobile Service Provider (MSP) that launches a smart city
   service based on IoT data readings. In order to serve IoT data collected
   across different locations, the MSP dynamically negotiates and rescales
   bandwidth and service functions. 5G network slicing functions are key to
   lease appropriate amount of resources over heterogeneous access
   technologies and different site types. Also, different infrastructure
   providers will charge slicing service depending on specific access
   technology supported across regional sites and IoT data collection
   patterns.
   We introduce a pricing mechanism based on Age of Information (AoI) to
   reduce the cost of MSPs. It provides incentives for devices to smooth
   traffic by shifting part of the traffic load from highly congested and
   more expensive locations to lesser charged ones, while meeting QoS
   requirements of the IoT service. The proposed optimal pricing scheme
   comprises a two-stage decision process, where the MSP determines the
   pricing of each location and devices schedule uploads of collected data
   based on the optimal uploading policy. Simulations show that the MSP
   attains consistent cost reductions tuning the trade-off between slicing
   costs and the AoI of uploaded IoT data.},

Abstract = {Smart city environments, when applied to healthcare, improve the quality
   of people's lives, enabling, for instance, disease prediction and
   treatment monitoring. In medical settings, case prioritization is of
   great importance, with beneficial outcomes both in terms of patient
   health and physicians' daily work. Recommender systems are an
   alternative to automatically integrate the data generated in such
   environments with predictive models and recommend actions, content, or
   services. The data produced by smart devices are accurate and reliable
   for predictive and decision-making contexts. This study main purpose is
   to assist patients and doctors in the early detection of disease or
   prediction of postoperative worsening through constant monitoring. To
   achieve this objective, this study proposes an architecture for
   recommender systems applied to healthcare, which can prioritize
   emergency cases. The architecture brings an ensemble approach for
   prediction, which adopts multiple Machine Learning algorithms. The
   methodology used to carry out the study followed three steps. First, a
   systematic literature mapping, second, the construction and development
   of the architecture, and third, the evaluation through two case studies.
   The results demonstrated the feasibility of the proposal. The
   predictions are promising and adherent to the application context for
   accurate datasets with a low amount of noises or missing values.},

Abstract = {Fog computing can provide computational resources and low-latency
   communication at the network edge. But with it comes uncertainties that
   must be managed in order to guarantee Service Level Agreements. Service
   observability can help the environment better deal with uncertainties,
   delivering relevant and up-to-date information in a timely manner to
   support decision making. Observability is considered a superset of
   monitoring since it uses not only performance metrics, but also other
   instrumentation domains such as logs and traces. However, as Fog
   Computing is typically characterised by resource-constrained nodes and
   network uncertainties, increasing observability in fog can be risky due
   to the additional load injected into a restricted environment. There is
   no work in the literature that evaluated fog observability. In this
   paper, we first outline the challenges of achieving observability in a
   Fog environment, based on which we present a formal definition of fog
   observability. Subsequently, a real-world Fog Computing testbed running
   a smart city use case is deployed, and an empirical evaluation of fog
   observability using open-source tools is presented. The results show
   that under certain conditions, it is viable to provide observability in
   a Fog Computing environment using open-source tools, although it is
   necessary to control the overhead modifying their default configuration
   according to the application characteristics.},

Title = {Impact of Node Density on the QoS Parameters of Routing Protocols in
   Opportunistic Networks for Smart Spaces},
Journal = {MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {2020},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {The need and importance of Smart Spaces have been potentially realized
   by the researchers due to its applicability in the current lifestyle.
   Opportunistic network, a successor of mobile ad hoc networks and a
   budding technology of network, is a best-suited technology for
   implementing Smart Spaces due to its wide range of applications in
   real-life scenarios ranging from building smart cities to interplanetary
   communication. There are numerous routing protocols which are available
   in opportunistic network, each having their pros and cons; however, no
   research till the time of listing has been done which can quantitatively
   demonstrate the maximum performance of these protocols and standardize
   the comparison of opportunistic routing protocols which has been a major
   cause of ambiguous performance evaluation studies. The work here
   presents a categorical view of the opportunistic routing protocol family
   and thereby compares and contrasts the various simulators suited for
   their simulation. Thereafter, the most popular protocols (selecting at
   least one protocol from each category) are compared based on node
   density on as many as 8 standard performance metrics using ONE simulator
   to observe their scalability, realism, and comparability. The work
   concludes by presenting the merits and demerits of each of the protocols
   discussed as well as specifying the best routing protocol among all the
   available protocols for Smart Spaces with maximum output. It is believed
   that the results achieved by the implemented methodology will help
   future researchers to choose appropriate routing protocol to delve into
   their research under different scenarios.},

Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {39939-39968},
Abstract = {Advances in the miniaturization, computational capabilities, and cost
   reduction of semiconductor technology have made global navigation
   satellite systems (GNSSs) the favorite choice for positioning.
   Currently, positioning is a key factor for many essential tasks in our
   modern society and will become even more important with the advent of
   new concepts such as the Internet of Things (IoT), smart cities and
   autonomous driving. The extensive use of GNSSs in a wide range of
   applications has caused their migration from the professional segment to
   the mass-market segment in terms of both technology and performance.
   This presents new and more stringent requirements in terms of accuracy,
   robustness, ubiquity, and continuity for the original ``open sky{''}
   GNSS design. GNSS technology has experienced an unprecedented evolution
   in the last decade, and it is expected to exponentially evolve in the
   next decade. This evolution is considered in this paper with the aim of
   providing a unified reference for current GNSS receiver technologies and
   solutions and its expected evolution in the next decade. We consider
   receiver concepts, antennae, RF front ends, digital signal processing,
   and positioning algorithms. The impacts on the different GNSS market
   segments and applications are also analyzed.},

Abstract = {Extreme Events have recently become a topic of interest mainly due to
   the impacts of climate change worldwide over the last years. Such events
   commonly have a severe impact on major cities. Especially in Brazilian
   cities, the combination of climate change and unplanned urban growth on
   steep slopes has led to floods and landslides that killed thousands of
   people over the past decade. Once an extreme event impacts a city, a
   series of emergency events (henceforth named e-events) are registered by
   the citizens (by calling the local emergency telephone number). These
   e-events may vary from a small flood to a large-scale landslide. Thus,
   it is a top priority for governments to respond to these e-events as
   fast and as efficiently as possible. The problem is that the number of
   e-events is usually larger than the number of people (and vehicles) to
   respond to them. Another challenge is that these vehicles have to cross
   an impacted city with major traffic jams. The routes have to consider
   real-time traffic data to avoid streets with heavy traffic. This article
   proposes an approach named IRONSTONE, which aims at collecting the
   topology of the city and real-time traffic data to generate optimized
   routes for teams to respond to e-events. The proposed approach was
   evaluated with real scenarios of the city of Niteroi and the results are
   promising.},

Abstract = {Smart control access to any service is at the very basis of any smart
   city project. Biometrics have been used as a solution for system access
   control, for many years now. However, the simple use of biometrics can
   not be considered as final and perfect solution. Most problems are
   related to the data transmission way between the medias, where the users
   require access and the servers where the biometric data, captured upon
   registration, are stored. In this paper, the use smart-cards is adopted
   as a possible effective yet efficient solution to this problem.
   Palm-prints have been used as a human identifier for a long time now.
   This biometric is considered one of the most reliable to distinguish a
   person from another as its unique yet stable over time. In this work, we
   propose an efficient implementation of palm-print verification on
   smart-cards. For this implementation, the matching is done on-card.
   Thus, the biometric characteristics are always kept in the owner's card,
   guaranteeing the maximum security and privacy. In a first approach, the
   False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) are improved
   using upward, downward, leftward and rightward translations of the
   matched palm-codes. However, after thorough analysis of the achieved
   results, we show that the proposed method introduces a significant
   increase in terms of execution time of the matching operation. In order
   to mitigate this impact, we augmented the proposed technique with an
   acceptance threshold verification, thus decreasing drastically the
   execution time of the matching operation, and yet achieving considerably
   low FAR and FRR. It is noteworthy to point out that these
   characteristics are at the basis of any access control successful usage.},

Abstract = {Vehicle-based sensing is a valuable paradigm to serve third-party
   applications, but understanding the coverage of such networks is not
   trivial. For urban buses, trajectories are spatially predictable, but
   traffic conditions can hinder data timeliness. In this letter, we
   propose a metric to quantify the contribution of individual buses to the
   coverage of different applications. We apply this metric to bus mobility
   traces from Rio de Janeiro for applications of waste management, air
   quality, and noise monitoring, ranking buses accordingly. We show that
   bus contribution is strongly related to the application - 23\% of buses
   change more than 2,000 places in different application rankings.},

Abstract = {Assuring an efficient Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous
   Internet of Things services is a challenge, mainly due to spectrum
   scarcity and bandwidth limitations on the radio access network. To solve
   these problems, efficient management of airtime per station (STA) is
   necessary. In this work, we propose a scheduler to perform dynamic
   network slicing in IEEE 802.11ah Networks. The proposed scheduler is
   based on virtualization technologies to assure QoS restrictions per
   slice and can be deployed in the Access Point (AP) or in a virtual
   machine connected to the AP. Network metrics are used to verify QoS
   violations per slice over time. Once a QoS restriction is detected, the
   scheduler performs a reallocation of resources re-configuring the
   Restricted Access Windows parameters that compose a slice, adjusting
   airtime per STA. To evaluate the proposed scheduler, we consider a
   dynamic policy. Simulation results in a smart city scenario show that
   the dynamic policy is able to scale the network and satisfies QoS slice
   requirements.},

Title = {A distributed beaconless routing protocol for real-time video

Abstract = {Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANETs) will play an important role in Smart
   Cities and will support the development of not only safety applications,
   but also car smart video surveillance services. Recent improvements in
   multimedia over VANETs allow drivers, passengers, and rescue teams to
   capture, share, and access on-road multimedia services. Vehicles can
   cooperate with each other to transmit live flows of traffic accidents or
   disasters and provide drivers, passengers, and rescue teams rich visual
   information about a monitored area. Since humans will watch the videos,
   their distribution must be done by considering the provided Quality of
   Experience (QoE) even in multi-hop, multi-path, and dynamic
   environments. This article introduces an application framework to handle
   this kind of services and a routing protocol, the DBD (Distributed
   Beaconless Dissemination), that enhances the dissemination of live video
   flows on multimedia highway VANETs. DBD uses a backbone-based approach
   to create and maintain persistent and high quality routes during the
   video delivery in opportunistic Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) scenarios. It
   also improves the performance of the IEEE 802.11p MAC layer, by solving
   the Spurious Forwarding (SF) problem, while increasing the packet
   delivery ratio and reducing the forwarding delay. Performance evaluation
   results show the benefits of DBD compared to existing works in
   forwarding videos over VANETs, where main objective and subjective QoE
   results are measured. (C) 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {Trustful Internet of Things (IoT) plays an important role in smart
   cities. The trust information in surveillance data motivates the
   analysis of images from numerous IoT devices. Saliency detection is a
   fundamental step in surveillance data analysis for providing help to the
   subsequent tasks, but unsuitable to IoT applications owing to the
   neglect of image similarity and difference from diverse IoT devices. To
   solve this problem, we enable the co-saliency detection in IoT, which
   detects the common and salient foreground regions in the group
   surveillance images. The main contributions include: 1) enable a
   multistage context perception scheme to efficiently extract the
   contextual information corresponding to different-size receptive fields
   in the single image; 2) construct a two-path information propagation to
   extract the interimage similarity and difference from the high-level
   image feature representations of the group images; and 3) propose the
   stage-wise refinement to allocate the label information to different
   parts of the network for helping the network to learn the enriched
   semantically common knowledge. The extensive experiments performed on
   three public data sets can demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach
   and its superiority to four state-of-the-art co-saliency detection
   methods.},

Abstract = {A new era of automated services has permeated user's daily lives thanks
   to paradigms such as Smart City and the Internet of Things. This shift
   from traditional applications is possible due to the massive amount of
   heterogeneous devices that constitute the Internet of Things. To provide
   newly improved characteristics to these services, such as mobility
   support, high resilience, and low latency, an extension to the Cloud
   computing paradigm was created, called Fog computing, which brings
   processing and storage resources towards the edge of the network, in the
   vicinity of the Internet of Things environment.
   This scenario implies a higher complexity level needed to coordinate
   available resources and how applications and services use them. Although
   some solutions have been proposed for the Cloud, several characteristics
   differentiate the Cloud from the Fog, creating the need for new
   mechanisms for the coordination of resources, applications, and services
   in the Fog.
   This paper explains the challenges present in the Fog that call for new
   mechanisms to later propose an architecture to manage resources in the
   Fog using a hybrid approach. In the Internet of Things and South-Bound
   Fog Levels, a distributed management of applications and services is
   proposed applying choreography techniques to enable automated fast
   decision making. A centralized approach to orchestrate applications and
   services taking advantage of a global knowledge of the resources
   available in the network is suggested for the North-Bound Fog and Cloud
   Levels.},

Title = {A Virtual Infrastructure Model Based on Data Reuse to Support
   Intelligent Transportation System Applications},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2025},
Volume = {13},
Pages = {40607-40620},
Abstract = {Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have significantly improved
   transportation quality by using applications capable of monitoring,
   managing, and improving the transportation system. However, the large
   number of devices required to provide data to ITS applications has
   become a challenge in recent years, particularly the high installation
   and maintenance costs made broad deployment impracticable. Despite
   several advances in smart city research and the internet of things
   (IoT), research on ITS is still in the early stages. In this sense, to
   improve data collection and maintenance strategies for ITS systems, this
   article proposes a virtual infrastructure model based on data reuse,
   mainly autonomous vehicle (AV) data, to support ITS applications. It
   presents design choices and challenges for deploying a virtual
   infrastructure based on Beyond 5G (B5G) communication and data reuse,
   followed by developing a proof of concept of an AV data acquisition
   system evaluated through simulation. The results show that the extra
   data collection module results in a 1.1\% increase in total memory usage
   with direct sensor collection and a 2.6\% increase with application
   performance management (APM) data collection on the reference hardware.
   This data reuse setup can significantly improve ITS data challenges with
   minimal impact on current technology stack on the Autonomous vehicles
   currently in circulation.},

Title = {A Management Architecture for IoT Smart Solutions: Design and
   Implementation},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NETWORK AND SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {The management of IoT solutions is a complex task due to their inherent
   distribution and heterogeneity. IoT management approaches focus on
   devices and connectivity, thus lacking a comprehensive understanding of
   the different software, hardware, and communication components that
   comprise an IoT-based solution. This paper proposes a novel four-layer
   IoT Management Architecture (IoTManA) that encompasses various aspects
   of a distributed infrastructure for managing, controlling, and
   monitoring software, hardware, and communication components, as well as
   dataflows and data quality. Our architecture provides a cross-layer
   graph-based view of the end-to-end path between devices and the cloud.
   IoTManA has been implemented in a set of software components named IoT
   management system (IoTManS) and tested in two scenarios-Smart
   Agriculture and Smart Cities-showing that it can significantly
   contribute to harnessing the complexity of managing IoT solutions. The
   cross-layer graph-based modeling of IoTManA facilitates the implemented
   management system (IoTManS) to detect and identify root causes of
   typically distributed failures occurring in IoT solutions. We conducted
   a performance analysis of IoTManS focusing on two aspects-failure
   detection time and scalability-to demonstrate application scenarios and
   capabilities. The results show that IoTManS can detect and identify the
   root cause of failures in 806ms to 90,036ms depending on its operation
   mode, adapting to different IoT needs. Also, the IoTManS scalability is
   directly proportional to the scalability of the underlying IoT Platform,
   managing up to 5,000 components simultaneously.},

Title = {The Impact of Message Replication on the Performance of Opportunistic
   Networks for Sensed Data Collection},
Journal = {INFORMATION},

Volume = {8},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Opportunistic networks (OppNets) provide a scalable solution for
   collecting delay-tolerant data from sensors to their respective
   gateways. Portable handheld user devices contribute significantly to the
   scalability of OppNets since their number increases according to user
   population and they closely follow human movement patterns. Hence,
   OppNets for sensed data collection are characterised by high node
   population and degrees of spatial locality inherent to user movement. We
   study the impact of these characteristics on the performance of existing
   OppNet message replication techniques. Our findings reveal that the
   existing replication techniques are not specifically designed to cope
   with these characteristics. This raises concerns regarding excessive
   message transmission overhead and throughput degradations due to
   resource constraints and technological limitations associated with
   portable handheld user devices. Based on concepts derived from the
   study, we suggest design guidelines to augment existing message
   replication techniques. We also follow our design guidelines to propose
   a message replication technique, namely Locality Aware Replication
   (LARep). Simulation results show that LARep achieves better network
   performance under high node population and degrees of spatial locality
   as compared with existing techniques.},

Abstract = {Widely deploying sensors in the environment and embedding them in
   physical objects is a crucial step towards realizing smart and
   sustainable cities. To cope with rising resource demands and limited
   budgets, opportunistic networks (OppNets) offer a scalable backhaul
   option for collecting delay-tolerant data from sensors to gateways in
   order to enable efficient urban operations and services. While pervasive
   devices such as smartphones and tablets contribute significantly to the
   scalability of OppNets, closely following human movement patterns and
   social structure introduces network characteristics that pose routing
   challenges. Our study on the impact of these characteristics reveals
   that existing routing protocols subject a key set of devices to higher
   resource consumption, to which their users may respond by withdrawing
   participation. Unfortunately, existing solutions addressing this
   unfairness do not guarantee achievable throughput since they are not
   specifically designed for sensed data collection scenarios. Based on
   concepts derived from the study, we suggest design guidelines for
   adapting applicable routing protocols to sensed data collection
   scenarios. We also follow our design guidelines to propose the Fair
   Locality Aware Routing (FLARoute) technique. Evaluating FLARoute within
   an existing routing protocol confirms improved fairness and throughput
   under conditions that compromise the performance of existing solutions.},

Title = {Beaconless Traffic-Aware Geographical Routing Protocol for Intelligent
   Transportation System},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {187671-187686},
Abstract = {Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) in sustainable smart cities are
   taking advantage of moving vehicle nodes for data communication. VANETs
   support many applications related to safety, infotainment, and accident
   detection. The routing protocols are using for data communication in the
   presence of high mobility nodes and dynamic topologies. Due to high
   mobility and unpredictable topologies, the data communication becomes
   unreliable which causes data loss, delay, and link disconnections among
   vehicle nodes. To address these routing limitations, various types of
   routing protocols have developed. In all existing routing protocols
   types, geographic routing protocols are one of the efficient types due
   to its low overhead processes. Geographical routing protocols are able
   to handle vehicular environment constraints. However, with many
   advantages, geographic routing protocols are not considering many
   constraints of the vehicular environment. Geographical routing protocols
   should have well-defined routing metrics to deal with high mobility and
   other data loss and link disconnection issues. This research designs a
   Beaconless Traffic-Aware Geographical Routing Protocol (BTA-GRP) by
   considering traffic density, distance and direction for next forwarder
   node and route selection. The protocol is feasible for urban dense and
   sparse traffic conditions and addresses delay, disconnection and packet
   dropping issues. The proposed protocol has simulated with state of the
   art routing protocols. The simulation results indicated that the
   proposed protocol has higher performance in VANETs.},

Title = {GoalD: A Goal-Driven deployment framework for dynamic and heterogeneous
   computing environments},
Journal = {INFORMATION AND SOFTWARE TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {111},
Pages = {159-176},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Context Emerging paradigms like Internet of Things and Smart Cities
   utilize advanced sensing and communication infrastructures, where
   heterogeneity is an inherited feature. Applications targeting such
   environments require adaptability and context-sensitivity to uncertain
   availability and failures in resources and their ad-hoc networks. Such
   heterogeneity is often hard to predict, making the deployment process a
   challenging task.
   Objective: This paper proposes GoalD as a goal-driven framework to
   support autonomous deployment of heterogeneous computational resources
   to fulfill requirements, seen as goals, and their correlated components
   on one hand, and the variability space of the hosting computing and
   sensing environment on the other hand.
   Method: GoalD comprises an offline and an online stage to fulfill
   autonomous deployment by leveraging the use of goals. Deployment
   configuration strategies arise from the variability structure of the
   Contextual Goal Model as an underlying structure to guide autonomous
   planning by selecting available as well as suitable resources at
   runtime.
   Results: We evaluate GoalD on an existing exemplar from the
   self-adaptive systems community the Tele Assistance Service provided by
   Weyns and Calinescu {[}1]. Furthermore, we evaluate the scalability of
   GoalD on a repository consisting of 430,500 artifacts. The evaluation
   results demonstrate the usefulness and scalability of GoalD in planning
   the deployment of a system with thousands of components in a few
   milliseconds.
   Conclusion: GoalD is a framework to systematically tackle autonomous
   deployment in highly heterogeneous computing environments, partially
   unknown at design-time following a goal-oriented approach to achieve the
   user goals in a target environment. GoalD has demonstrated itself able
   to scale for deployment planning dealing with thousands of components in
   a few milliseconds.},

Abstract = {The growth in the number of connected vehicles in ad-hoc networks or
   VANETs enables the use of increasingly sophisticated services and
   applications. One emerging application in this scenario is Platooning, a
   stable stream of connected autonomous vehicles. This application
   improves safety, vehicle flow on the road, energy consumption, among
   other variables. However, vehicles using this technology need to share
   space with vehicles not connected or with other automation levels. Among
   the bottlenecks in scenarios like this, Platoons formation and splits
   stand out, as these maneuvers involve costs and risk. Therefore, our
   contribution is developing a new strategy for Platoons formation in a
   mixed universe of vehicles to bring some of these desired benefits. The
   results show that the proposed solution achieved an accuracy of 89\% of
   the entire amount of platoons in the datasets. Our experiments
   demonstrate cases with collisions, and the proposed solution provides a
   solution to a more safe operation on roads. Finally, we conclude that
   our solution provides more determinism in the traffic conditions, as
   vehicles achieving stationary speeds with low variation.},

Title = {A Cybertwin-Assisted Pervasive Computing Framework for Edge-Blurred
   Image Segmentation Using Evolutionary Neural Computing},
Journal = {HUMAN-CENTRIC COMPUTING AND INFORMATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {14},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {This work takes aim at how challenging image segmentation tasks where
   edges are blurred still are. As a consequence, evolutionary neural
   computing (ENC) is introduced to develop an enhanced segmentation model
   for such scenes. This calls for strong computing power and sufficient
   bearing capacity. In future smart cities, fortunately,
   cybertwin-assisted pervasive computing has been a more practical way to
   facilitate deploying various intelligent perception tasks. Thus, this
   paper uses a cybertwin-assisted pervasive computing framework for edge-
   blurred image segmentation using ENC. The technical methodology
   comprises two main parts, namely the backbone network and parameter
   evolution. On the one hand, the grayscale segmentation is first
   transferred as a pixel-level binary classification task. The main
   network structure of the proposal is a convolution neural network model
   composed of several computing layers and one parameter updating layer.
   Alternatively, the adaptive genetic algorithm is introduced to
   re-optimize parameters during each round. Two groups of real-world
   images are collected to construct experimental scenarios for carrying
   out two aspects of assessment work. For one thing, the training process
   of the proposed model is visualized to inspect its training effect. For
   another, the proposed model is compared with three baseline methods to
   prove its performance superiority. In conclusion, the introduction of
   evolutionary computing can produce improvements of more than 10
   percentage points.},

Abstract = {The network of objects/things embedded with electronics, software,
   sensors, and network connectivity, Internet of Things (IoT), creates
   many exciting applications (e.g., smart grids, smart homes, and smart
   cities) by enabling objects/things to collect and exchange data so that
   they can be sensed and controlled. To fulfill IoT, one essential step is
   to connect various objects/things (e.g., mobile phones, cars, and
   buildings) so that they can ``talk{''} to each other (i.e., collect and
   exchange data). However, substantial case studies show that simply
   connecting them without further collaboration among the objects/things
   when ``talking{''} to each other leads to unnecessary energy
   consumption, uncertain security, unstable performance, etc., for IoT.
   Therefore, collaboration for IoT is very important. Specifically, there
   are a lot of critical issues to consider in terms of how to achieve
   robust collaboration among the objects/things for IoT. For instance, how
   to conduct collaboration among the objects/things so that more
   energy-efficient communication can be achieved for IoT? How to conduct
   collaboration among the objects/things so that computing with higher
   performance can be achieved for IoT? How to improve the security of IoT
   with collaboration among the objects/things? How to enhance the Quality
   of Service of IoT with collaboration among the objects/things? How to
   minimize the overhead costs when objects/things are collaborating in
   IoT?},

Abstract = {Recently, Network Slicing in Radio Access Technologies (RATs) has been
   proposed as an approach to divide the wireless network infrastructure
   into isolated logical slices which are defined following their
   requirements and features in a service-driven way. To the best of our
   knowledge, the application of Network Slicing has not been explored in
   IEEE 802.11ah Networks. In this work, we propose a Virtual Network
   Slicing Broker (VNSB), a Virtual Network Function (VNF) instantiated
   inside a Software Defined Network (SDN) controller which communicates
   with an IEEE 802.11ah network Access Point (AP) via a southbound
   Application Program Interface (API). Based on information obtained by
   the northbound API, the slicing broker gets the information contained in
   the slicing templates, which describes the services features and
   respective Quality of Service (QoS) restrictions. With these data, the
   slicing broker makes logical slices in the context of the Restricted
   Access Windows (RAW) which are periodically sent by the AP to the
   stations (STA) via the Raw Parameter Set (RPS). Since there is no
   hardware with the IEEE 802.11ah standard available on the market, we
   validate the proposed solution through extensive simulations in a
   typical smart city scenario. Results showed the broker capacity to build
   and manage logical slices per service, respecting the QoS restrictions
   of each offered service. Moreover, the proposed slicing broker makes use
   of available resources of neighbor slices reducing delay, packet loss,
   and efficiently maximizing throughput per slice.},

Abstract = {Vision sensors in Internet of Things (IoT)-connected smart cities play a
   vital role in the exponential growth of video data, thereby making its
   analysis and storage comparatively tough and challenging. Those sensors
   continuously generate data for 24 hours, which requires huge storage
   resources, dedicated networks for sharing with data centers, and most
   importantly, it makes browsing, retrieval, and event searching a
   difficult and time-consuming job. Video summarization (VS) is a
   promising direction toward a solution to these problems by analyzing the
   visual contents acquired from a vision sensor and prioritizing them
   based on events, saliency, person's appearance, and so on. However, the
   current VS literature still lacks focus on resource-constrained devices
   that can summarize data over the edge and upload it to data repositories
   efficiently for instant analysis. Therefore, in this article, we carry
   out a survey of functional VS methods to understand their pros and cons
   for resource-constrained devices, with the ambition to provide a compact
   tutorial to the community of researchers in the field. Further, we
   present a novel saliency-aware VS framework, incorporating 5G-enabled
   IoT devices, which keeps only important data, thereby saving storage
   resources and providing representative data for immediate exploration.
   Keeping privacy of data as a second priority, we intelligently encrypt
   the salient frames over resource-constrained devices before transmission
   over the 5G network. The reported experimental results show that our
   proposed framework has additional benefits of faster transmission (1.8
   similar to 13.77 percent frames of a lengthy video are considered for
   transmission), reduced bandwidth, and real-time processing compared to
   state-of-the-art methods in the field.},

Abstract = {Disruptive applications for mobile devices can be enhanced by Edge
   computing facilities. In this context, Edge Computing (EC) is a proposed
   architecture to meet the mobility requirements imposed by these
   applications in a wide range of domains, such as the Internet of Things,
   Immersive Media, and Connected and Autonomous Vehicles. EC architecture
   aims to introduce computing capabilities in the path between the user
   and the Cloud to execute tasks closer to where they are consumed, thus
   mitigating issues related to latency, context awareness, and mobility
   support. In this survey, we describe which are the leading technologies
   to support the deployment of EC infrastructure. Thereafter, we discuss
   the applications that can take advantage of EC and how they were
   proposed in the literature. Finally, after examining enabling
   technologies and related applications, we identify some open challenges
   to fully achieve the potential of EC, and also research opportunities on
   upcoming paradigms for service provisioning. This survey is a guide to
   comprehend the recent advances on the provisioning of mobile
   applications, as well as foresee the expected next stages of evolution
   for these applications.},

Title = {Physically Secure Lightweight Anonymous User Authentication Protocol for
   Internet of Things Using Physically Unclonable Functions},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2019},
Volume = {7},
Pages = {85627-85644},
Abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) acts as an umbrella for the
   Internet-enabled devices for various applications, such as smart home,
   smart city, smart grid, and smart healthcare. The emergence of the
   immense economic potential necessitates a robust authentication
   mechanism that needs to be lightweight and suitable for real-time
   applications. Moreover, the physical integrity of these devices cannot
   be assumed as these are designed to be deployed in an unattended
   environment with minimum human supervision. A user authentication
   mechanism for the IoT, in addition to guaranteeing user anonymity and
   un-traceability functionality requirements, must also be resistant to
   device physical capture and related misuses. In this paper, we present a
   novel lightweight anonymous user authentication protocol for the IoT
   environment by utilizing ``cryptographic one-way hash function{''},
   ``physically unclonable function (PUF){''} and ``bitwise exclusive-OR
   (XOR){''} operations. The broadly accepted Real-Or-Random (ROR)
   model-based formal security analysis, formal security verification using
   the automated software verification tool, namely ``automated validation
   of internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA){''} and also
   non-mathematical (informal) security analysis have been carried out on
   the proposed scheme. It is shown that the proposed scheme has the
   ability to resist various well-known attacks that are crucial for
   securing the IoT environment. Through a detailed comparative study, we
   show that the proposed scheme outperforms other existing related schemes
   in terms of computation and communication costs, and also security \&
   functionality features. Finally, a practical demonstration of the
   proposed scheme using the NS3 simulation has been provided for measuring
   various network performance parameters.},

Abstract = {As we all know that the technology is projected to be next to humans
   very soon because of its holistic growth. Now-a-days, we see a lot of
   applications that are making our lives comfortable such as smart cars,
   smart homes, smart traffic management, smart offices, smart medical
   consultation, smart cities, etc. All such facilities are in the reach of
   a common man because of the advancement in Information and
   Communications Technology (ICT). Because of this advancement, new
   computing and communication environment such as Internet of Things (IoT)
   came into picture. Lot of research work is in progress in IoT domain
   which helps for the overall development of the society and makes the
   lives easy and comfortable. But in the resource constrained environment
   of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and IoT, it is almost inconceivable to
   establish a fully secure system. As we are moving forward very fast,
   technology is becoming more and more vulnerable to the security threats.
   In future, the number of Internet connected people will be less than the
   smart objects so we need to prepare a robust system for keeping the
   above mentioned environments safe and standardized it for the smooth
   conduction of communication among IoT objects. In this survey paper, we
   provide the details of threat model applicable for the security of WSN
   and IoT based communications. We also discuss the security requirements
   and various attacks possible in WSN and IoT based communication
   environments. The emerging projects of WSNs integrated to IoT are also
   briefed. We then provide the details of different architectures of WSN
   and IoT based communication environments. Next, we discuss the current
   issues and challenges related to WSN and IoT. We also provide a critical
   literature survey of recent intrusion detection protocols for IoT and
   WSN environments along with their comparative analysis. A taxonomy of
   security and privacy-preservation protocols in WSN and IoT is also
   highlighted. Finally, we discuss some research challenges which need to
   be addressed in the coming future.},

Title = {Predictability and Fairness in Social Sensing},
Journal = {IEEE INTERNET OF THINGS JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {9},
Number = {1},
Pages = {37-54},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {We consider the design of distributed algorithms that govern the manner
   in which agents contribute to a social sensing platform. Specifically,
   we are interested in situations, where fairness among the agents
   contributing to the platform is needed. A notable example is the
   platforms operated by public bodies, where fairness is a legal
   requirement. The design of such distributed systems is challenging due
   to the fact that we wish to simultaneously realize an efficient social
   sensing platform but also deliver a predefined quality of service to the
   agents (for example, a fair opportunity to contribute to the platform).
   In this article, we introduce iterated function systems (IFSs) as a tool
   for the design and analysis of systems of this kind. We show how the IFS
   framework can be used to realize systems that deliver a predictable
   quality of service to agents, can be used to underpin contracts
   governing the interaction of agents with the social sensing platform,
   and which are efficient. To illustrate our design via a use case, we
   consider a large, high-density network of participating parked vehicles.
   When awoken by an administrative center, this network proceeds to search
   for moving missing entities of interest using RFID-based techniques. We
   regulate which vehicles are actively searching for the moving entity of
   interest at any point in time. In doing so, we seek to equalize
   vehicular energy consumption across the network. This is illustrated
   through simulations of a search for a missing Alzheimer's patient in
   Melbourne, Australia. The experimental results are presented to
   illustrate the efficacy of our system and the predictability of access
   of agents to the platform independent of initial conditions.},
