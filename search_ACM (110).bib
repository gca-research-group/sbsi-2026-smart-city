abstract = {Effective assessments are essential for producing reliable results, which, in turn, facilitate a deeper understanding of the subject under investigation. For researchers in the field of Software Engineering (SE), robust assessment strategies play a pivotal role in advancing existing technologies and gauging the suitability of emerging ones. In today’s interconnected world, characterized by the proliferation of smart cities, creating a comprehensive usability assessment plan for smart city applications has posed a unique challenge, primarily due to the multifaceted nature of this paradigm. Aims: The primary objective of this study is to develop and introduce a tool that aids evaluators, mainly novices in usability, in crafting a comprehensive usability assessment plan for smart city applications. This tool aims to encompass all essential elements necessary for a thorough evaluation of the usability of such applications. Method: The instrument is a checklist designed in conformity with experimental best practices and based on experts’ experience in planning and conducting assessments. It was evaluated by experts in assessment planning and has been undergoing a case study of a middleware platform for smart city application development. Results: The use of the instrument aids in the planning of usability assessments of smart city applications, therefore contributing to adapting the usability assessment to the context of a smart city. Conclusions: Even though it is not possible to determine the success of the assessment by using the checklist on its planning, the instrument seeks to encompass the relevant usability points and guide the assessment toward the smart city aspect of the application.},

abstract = {Emerging IoT applications with stringent requirements on latency and data processing have posed many challenges to cloud-centric platforms for Smart Cities. Recently, Fog Computing has been advocated as a promising approach to support such new applications and handle the increasing volume of IoT data and devices. The Fog Computing paradigm is characterized by a horizontal system-level architecture where devices close to end-users and IoT devices are used for processing, storage, and networking functions. Fog Computing platforms aim to facilitate the development of applications and systems for Smart Cities by providing services and abstractions designed to integrate data from IoT devices and various information systems deployed in the city. Despite the potential of the Fog Computing paradigm, the literature still lacks a broad, comprehensive overview of what has been investigated on the use of such paradigm in platforms for Smart Cities and open issues to be addressed in future research and development. In this paper, a systematic mapping study was performed and we present a comprehensive understanding of the use of the Fog Computing paradigm in Smart Cities platforms, providing an overview of the current state of research on this topic, and identifying important gaps in the existing approaches and promising research directions.},

abstract = {Urban areas across the globe are increasingly finding their way into the Smart Cities approach. As an initiative that aims to improve the quality of citizens' lives by finding new solutions to deal with urban problems deriving from fast urbanization, Smart Cities’ success depends on the involvement of society, the public sector, as well as private sector. However, to accelerate sustainable development, a quadruple-helix approach might be considered. Most publications on smart cities have been addressing government and civil society roles to generate innovations in urban areas. The role of academia and industry, the latter being the focus of this research, still requires new studies to shed light on the potential contributions of these groups of actors. The industry represents actors that, at the same time, can contribute to developing Smart Cities and being impacted by city changes, which reinforces they have a role in discussing Smart Cities. In this early-stage research paper, the industry is approached as the private sector. This short paper aims to discuss the role of the private},

abstract = {A smart city can be described as an organizational environment that seeks to provide a better quality of life for citizens by applying digital technologies to public services. In general, ICT governance involves managing investments and ICT resources to guide organizations to achieve their strategic goals. Thus, ICT governance in smart cities should evaluate, direct, and monitor Information Technology to achieve public value for the local community by providing digital services. Most research investigated ICT governance in private and public organizations and smart governance in smart city environments, but few focused on ICT governance in smart cities, especially in developing countries. Thus, this research investigated ICT governance in the context of Brazilian smart cities by developing a conceptual and practical integrative approach for the cities. To achieve this objective, a literature review and a survey with Brazilian professionals were conducted to identify relevant ICT governance practices applied to this context. As a result, this work introduces a set of related practices that municipalities can track when designing smart city projects in a digital transformation environment.},

abstract = {Context: Smart cities are the future in terms of good resource and people management practices. Several resources can be managed by smart cities, among them urban mobility and energy consumption stand out.Problem: The brightness of public roads consume energy resources, but they are not always necessary, as is the case with roads with no use. Thus, energy resources are wasted. This work aimed to explore the economy of energy resources by observing the flow of use of public roads.Solution: Sensors observe the roads, and the costs of the edges are sent to the fog that applies a graph algorithm to determine the paths that have movement and, thus, generate the reductions in energy consumption via switching off lamps or reducing their frequency.Information System Theory: Based on the General Systems Theory, the general system is mapped into independent systems: fog sensors (fog) and algorithm execution nodes (nodes with higher processing power). A general ecosystem is formulated making the information system based on the information generated by the observation of the sensors.Method: A simulated environment was proposed to obtain the representation of a region of interest. For this region, a graph approach based on Dijkstra was applied to consider the paths with the highest flow of accesses and, thus, propose energy consumption reductions.Results Summary: The results obtained point to a possibility of saving energy resources in the range of 60 to 79% depending on the type of lamps used, and the size of observed region. The results reinforce the need to explore intelligent resources for shared use resources management.Contributions and Impact in the IS area: Among the contributions to the area are: a manageable information system for public lighting. Use of fog for path management and energy matrix management. This work also contributes to proposing new approaches to the proposed problem, such as using the social context (via social networks) to define optimal paths.},

abstract = {Many characteristics are associated with the development of smart cities (SC), including the use of technologies to cope with complex problems related to the high levels of urbanization in the cities, such as guaranteeing better mobility, environment, and a better quality of life to citizens. In this sense, SC frameworks include, in general, governance and citizen participation as an essential dimension to assess the development of SC, based on the perspective that all stakeholders should share and contribute to solutions and visions for the future of the cities. Considering monitoring as a critical strategy to assess the advancement of SC initiatives, many measurement frameworks were created by different types of institutions and with diverse purposes. In this context, this paper aims to identify how SC measurement frameworks include indicators related to smart governance and citizen participation. Based on previous studies that systematized SC measurement frameworks and their main characteristics, this paper identified the presence of governance and citizen participation indicators, including the classification of approaches addressed by frameworks in this dimension. The methodology is based on desktop research and comparative analysis of SC measurement frameworks. Among the study results, the authors highlighted the lack of transparency of the indicators proposed in the analyzed measurement frameworks and the presence of different concepts and approaches to measure smart governance and citizen participation in SC initiatives.},

Smart cities, with technology as a basic component in urban management, are initiatives seen as a path towards sustainability and inclusiveness. Discussed by academics and practitioners to promote better living in urban spaces, gender issues have been neglected when studying and designing smart cities. Gender (in)equalities affect women's and men's lives in many ways, which include the different experiences and unequal situations in cities. By failing to address gender issues, urban spaces can potentially exacerbate inequalities. Additionally, disregarding gender issues through gender-blind policies does not make cities neutral but rather gendered only for a universal Subject. Based on a systematic and integrative literature review, we sought to answer the research question: Why gender shoud be considered when studying and designing smart cities? In addition to addressing the question, the intersectionality approach is presented as a means to promote gendered smart cities.},

The elaboration process was innovative as it used co-creation mechanisms to engage a group of institutions and people involved in the topic of digital transformation in cities. Based on a design policy approach, it featured design thinking activities, workshops, working groups, listening, and online public consultation. The result was the Brazilian Charter for Smart Cities, a document that presents an agenda to address digital transformation as an opportunity for sustainable urban development in Brazil. The strategy gives eight strategic goals addressed to different stakeholders. Furthermore, a collaborative network was formed that remains active and implements the strategic goals defined in the Charter. The experience illustrates the importance of establishing collaborative and participatory processes in formulating strategies and public policies. The challenge now is implementing the goals in Brazilian municipalities, which are highly diverse and unequal, and replicating this participatory model to formulate local smart city strategies.},

abstract = {When designing smart cities' building blocks, mobility data plays a fundamental role in applications and services. However, mobility data usually comes with unrestricted location of its corresponding entities (e.g., citizens and vehicles) and poses privacy concerns, among them recovering the identity of those entities with linking attacks. To address the privacy of users' identity, Location Privacy Protection Mechanisms (LPPMs) based on anonymization have been proposed, such as mix-zones. Once the data is protected, a comprehensive discussion about the trade-off between privacy and utility happens. However, issues still arise about the application of anonymized data to smart city development: what are the smart cities applications and services that can best leverage mobility data anonymized by mix-zones? To answer this question, we present a methodology that evaluates the utility in many aspects with metrics related to privacy, mobility, and anonymized trajectories produced by mix-zones. The results showed that the proposed methodology identifies application domains of smart cities in which anonymized data can have more or less utility. Additionally, different datasets present different behaviors in terms of utility. These insights can contribute significantly to the utility of both open and private data markets for smart cities.},

abstract = {The Strategic Planning (SP) of a Smart City (SC) must consider several smart and innovative dimensions, e.g., economy, mobility, environment, people, life, and governance. In these dimensions, there may be many components that require consideration of the innovation aspect. In the innovation context, using recent technologies is mandatory. Constructing SP for cities is one central aspect of the SC concept, mainly if the SP is built considering the participation of the population, which has been the Brazilian case. Considering the Brazilian scenario, many cities have constructed their specific SPs. A SP of a city considers specific local aspects, including local culture and geographical localization. Another reason a Brazilian city aims to be smarter is both being part of Brazilian SC ranks and receiving specific funding from the federal government for city smart projects. There are many cases in Brazil where the construction process of a city SP counts on the participation of undergraduate and graduate programs of Brazilian universities, as they can contribute to innovative technological solutions, which was the case of Niter\'{o}i City Hall. The city constructed a program with the Fluminense Federal University (UFF) to meet the goals established in Niter\'{o}i SP and the 2030 agenda of the United Nations (UN). This work aims to present a case study of the results of a Development Program of Applied Projects, called PDPA, and measures how much computational solutions of its projects meet the goals of the Niter\'{o}i SP. We are particularly interested in understanding the role of software artifacts in the innovation processes of SC.},

abstract = {In recent years, the domain of applications and information systems for Smart Cities (SC) has emerged and motivated researchers and practitioners to develop relevant solutions. The development of applications for SC involves many specificities, such as: (i) processing and analysis of large volumes of data; (ii) context-awareness; (iii) perception and actuation on physical elements of the city; and (iv) maintaining citizens’ privacy and security. It is important to ensure that these specificities have an adequate level of quality that enables the daily use of these applications in these cities. However, there is still no consolidated set of properties and / or characteristics that should be considered when evaluating the quality of this specific type of application. The goal of this work is to identify the characteristics and sub-characteristics of product quality that are being considered in the evaluation of applications and information systems in the context of SC. To do this, a Mapping Study was conducted, aiming to present an overview of the current state of the art in product quality for this context. Additionally, an analysis was carried out between the product quality characteristics of the ISO / IEC 25010: 2011 model with the characteristics identified in this mapping. As a result, eight related works, which deal with characteristics, such as Reliability, Compatibility, Maintenance, and Safety have been identified. Finally, there is a need for more detailed specifications of characteristics that enable the quality assurance of SC applications.},

In this concept, a smart city project involves planning, implementing and controlling good practices to obtain value from government investments and to provide better services to citizens. Consequently, an ICT governance approach represents a relevant outcome to evaluate, direct and monitor smart city initiatives to achieve cities' objectives. Considering that COBIT5 is a well-known IT governance framework for organizations of any kind, this work investigated COBIT5 application in smart cities context. By developing a Systematic Literature Review, it was revealed that, so far, COBIT5 framework fundamentals were poorly applied to smart city governance context. Therefore, through exploratory research, this paper proposes a roadmap approach to integrate COBIT5 governance requirements as a strategic ICT driver for smart city government initiatives. The results can be used by cities' governments and IT practitioners to implement ICT governance practices in smart cities context.},

abstract = {Currently, Smart Cities use computational solutions that promote services to improve the quality of life of the entire population. However, these systems are often heterogeneous and designed in an isolated way that makes it challenging to integrate with each other. One of the ways to integrate systems that provide interoperability is the System-of-system concept. Communication among systems depends on mutual agreements made by intermediaries. It increases the cost, constrains collaboration, and distrusts shared data and services. Blockchain can fulfill these gaps and be a trusted decentralized controller entity based on a consensus mechanism among network participants. This Early-stage paper presents an initial doctoral research proposal on how to combine Blockchain with Systems-of-Systems concepts to provide trusted interoperability between Smart Cities systems.},

abstract = {Smart city services are typically defined according to domains (e.g., health, education, safety) and supported by different systems. Consequently, the analysis of smart city data is often domain-specific, thus limiting the capabilities of the offered services and hampering decision-making that relies on isolated domain information. To support a suitable analysis across multiple domains, it is necessary having a unified data model able to handle the inherent heterogeneity of smart city data and take into account both geographic and citizen information. This paper presents an ontology-based information model to support multi-domain analysis in smart cities to foster interoperability and powerful automated reasoning upon unambiguous information. The proposed information model follows Linked Data principles and takes advantage of ontologies to define information semantically. The semantic relationships and properties defined in the model also allow inferring new pieces of information that improve accuracy when analyzing multiple city domains. This paper reports an evaluation of the information model through ontological metrics and competence questions.},

abstract = {With the advancement of information and communication technologies (ICTs), there has been high-scale utilization of IoT and adoption of AI in the transportation system to improve the utilization of energy, reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, increase quality of services, and provide many extensive benefits to the commuters and transportation authorities. In this article, we propose a novel edge-based AI-IoT integrated energy-efficient intelligent transport system for smart cities by using a distributed multi-agent system. An urban area is divided into multiple regions, and each region is sub-divided into a finite number of zones. At each zone an optimal number of RSUs are installed along with the edge computing devices. The MAS deployed at each RSU collects a huge volume of data from the various sensors, devices, and infrastructures. The edge computing device uses the collected raw data from the MAS to process, analyze, and predict. The predicted information will be shared with the neighborhood RSUs, vehicles, and cloud by using MAS with the help of IoT. The predicted information can be used by freight vehicles to maintain smooth and steady movement, which results in reduction in GHG emissions and energy consumption, and finally improves the freight vehicles’ mileage by reducing traffic congestion in the urban areas. We have exhaustively carried out the simulation results and demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed system.},

As the literature continues to grow the number of indicators and frameworks for "smartness" are becoming more robust and perspectives on what makes a city smart continue to evolve. This exploratory research analyzes text from 51 Wikipedia articles that describe cities considered "smart" according to three globally recognized and independent rankings of cities. By comparing findings on word frequencies and word associations found in Wikipedia articles with terminology found in academic literature on smart cities, this study intends to determine to what extent data about smart cities produced through Wikipedia's crowdsourcing approach relates to theoretical developments in the field. This inductive approach may open avenues to the application of automated text analysis methods in theorizing and empirical efforts with information produced about smart cities. This exploratory work may facilitate conceptual understanding of the properties and features of smart cities and may also open avenues to future applications of alternative conceptualization methods.},

However, the high heterogeneity and lack of standardization of these systems and their data challenge the development of value-added applications, which can be enriched with geographic information to allow for more effective actions over the real-world urban space. This paper introduces Smart Geo Layers (SGeoL), a geographic-layered data middleware platform conceived to integrate data provided by heterogeneous sources in a smart city environment. Besides easing such an integration, SGeoL allows correlating data with geographic information and it provides functionalities such as data aggregation, visualization, query, and analysis. This paper also presents the use of SGeoL in the development of a urban planning application as well as results of some computational experiments aimed to assess the performance of the platform.},

Smart cities typically encompass several distributed systems engaged in complex relationships, including the integration and interaction with other systems towards providing new functionalities. However, these systems are highly heterogeneous, developed with different technologies and data formats, and owned by distinct organizations and agencies within the system, thereby challenging the development of value-added applications. A way of addressing these issues is by holistically viewing a smart city as a system-of-systems (SoS), a set of complex systems with their own purpose and collaborating with each other to fulfill common global missions. In this perspective, we herein discuss how smart city systems could be holistically viewed as a complex SoS. We also shed light on some challenges related to the development of this type of systems in the context of smart cities.},

This article surveys the state of the art in software platforms for Smart Cities. We analyzed 23 projects concerning the most used enabling technologies, as well as functional and non-functional requirements, classifying them into four categories: Cyber-Physical Systems, Internet of Things, Big Data, and Cloud Computing. Based on these results, we derived a reference architecture to guide the development of next-generation software platforms for Smart Cities. Finally, we enumerated the most frequently cited open research challenges and discussed future opportunities.

In this context, population growth in urban centers manifested challenges in the economic and cultural aspects of society. Issues such as mobility and sustainability come up. ICT plays an important role in this scenario, as it enables innovative services to citizens to improve their quality of life. Objective: To identify and analyze technological solutions (tools, services, applications or products) of urban public monitoring in order to characterize them, with respect to smart cities and ubiquitous devices, from the point of view of researchers and public agents in the field. context of theoretical and applied research in the literature. Method: A Systematic Literature Mapping (SLM) was performed to characterize the research in the area. Results: It was found that most studies treat as important and global trend urban public monitoring through ubiquitous devices in the context of smart cities. Conclusion: Urban public monitoring can be performed through appropriate ICT infrastructures, using devices such as sensors to capture and transmit data in real-time. This communication takes place without the use of wires and it is necessary to worry about the energy efficiency and accuracy of these ubiquitous devices. This way, the city can become more efficient and attractive to its citizens.},

Thus, practitioners need to be better prepared for these new systems. The area of Smart Cities (SC) is emerging and presents new challenges in conceptual, technical and academical degrees. This paper presents an experience report of SE practices in the development of SC applications. Five teams used the SC platform and developed their projects, creating software documentation, while applying agile practices. As a result, we identified that some UML diagrams were not adequate to model specific SC's aspects and microservices. Furthermore, we identified that there was a low application of the proposed agile practices, such as pair programming and daily meetings. Despite being the first time this class was taught, we identified gaps that need to be investigated in order to identify which SE practices are more adequate for such context.},

abstract = {Modern cities are supported by many IT systems managed by distinct public and private agents. Such legacy systems are often incompatible since, in general, they use old, dependent and non-standardised technologies. This results in an environment in which there is no interoperability among smart city systems, preventing richer and more interesting applications to be used by citizens, companies, and city administration. An alternative to solve the lack of interoperability is the adoption of a System-of-Systems (SoS) approach. A SoS is a set of independent and heterogeneous constituent systems that interoperate to accomplish a global mission. The collaboration among such constituent systems enables a SoS to offer new functionalities that cannot be provided by any of these systems working as individual entities. The goal of this paper is to propose SoS-centric middleware services to support the management and execution of SoS in Smart Cities environments in a dynamic, transparent and scalable way. The proposed services, once integrated into a smart city platform, support interoperability among different systems operating in a city. Moreover, this paper also presents a motivational case study to make it clear the issues that must be addressed when multiple independent systems are brought together to provide a new Smart City service or application.},

abstract = {Cities need to collect, store and process huge amounts of data in order to provide smarter services, such as mobility, traffic, and disaster management. Social networks, such as Twitter and Instagram, are participatory sensing systems where communities generate a large amount of data every day. Existing studies have been often focused on collecting and transforming social media data into insights that may help citizens, with no concern whether the dataset represents the phenomenon they want to understand. In this paper, we explore the adequacy of social networking services to be used as platforms for smart city applications. Here we propose a methodology composed of three steps and undertake a performance analysis with Twitter as a proof of concept. Our results show that in spite of well-known data delivery constraints of the Twitter Streaming API, the majority of tweets could be successfully captured with a delay that makes it adequate to real-time processing.},

abstract = {The future of the cities is being planned based on new technologies, such as IoT and cloud computing, providing such infrastructure to citizens to use anywhere at anytime to support their activities. This new context is being called Smart Cities. However, this scenario aims at building cities' infrastructure, not attending citizens' needs to gather and form communities, considering the social nature of human beings and how disruptive technologies can be to the sense of community and citizenship. So, instead of the current social network trend reinforcing people using technology to create a "virtual social life" avoiding the physicality, we believe technology itself can be used to manage this techno-social dilemma, completing the technological infrastructure proposed for smart cities. We present a Digital Community Ecosystem (DCE) aiming at guiding technology? developers in the process of creating applications to bond communities in the Smart Cities era.},

There are several sources (official or not) that can provide information related to a city. The availability of multiple sources enables the design of advanced analyses for offering valuable services to both citizens and municipalities. However, such analyses would fail if the considered data were affected by errors and uncertainties: Data Quality is one of the main requirements for the successful exploitation of the available information. This paper highlights the importance of the Data Quality evaluation in the context of geographical data sources. Moreover, we describe how the Entity Matching task can provide additional information to refine the quality assessment and, consequently, obtain a better evaluation of the reliability data sources. Data gathered from the public transportation and urban areas of Curitiba, Brazil, are used to show the strengths and effectiveness of the presented approach.},

Municipal operations centers have played an important role in response of social events and natural disasters as a way to address the urgency and dynamism of urban problems. This research aims at analyzing the main dimensions and factors for implementing municipal operations centers as smart city initiatives. In order to explore this phenomenon it was conducted an exploratory study, based on multiple case studies. The empirical setting of this research is determined by municipal operations centers in Rio de Janeiro, Porto Alegre and Belo Horizonte. The research findings evidenced that the implementation of the centers comprises technological, organizational and managerial factors, in addition to political and institutional factors.

The main findings show that coordination between agencies and departments are needed to achieve citizen better quality of life. They also demonstrate that the use of the right technology is really important and a smart city initiative must have mobility and easy interaction with citizen. Finally, interdepartmental collaboration and cooperation are considered central issues to achieve initiatives' objectives.},

Key issues are the high throughput -- a large volume of data per second that needs to be processed, and the need to process ill formed natural language texts. With these in mind the framework has pipelined modules for robust, fast, real time tweet acquisition and storage, filtering of several kinds, natural language processing and sentiment analysis, that feed a final analysis and visualization module.

However, it is important to manage these data in an integrated way, enabling the exchange of information between existing fields and assisting in the decision-making process. Moreover, there's no way to tell how this data will need to be processed since each application may require it to be available obeying specific processes. Thus, this paper describes the design and implementation of a platform that aims to integrate, process and make available data streams from heterogeneous sources. It also defines an extensible data processing flow, which makes the creation of new processes for existing data and the inclusion of new types of data easier. Finally, a case study was conducted, which used a parking lot as scenario and assessed some important aspects related to platform implementation.},

Eleven axes were recognized and compared with other methodologies to evaluate the maturity level of city governance. This led to a questionnaire of diagnostic assessment to identify the maturity level in city councils. This method generated the score of each axis, which allowed visualization of the maturity model of council governance. The results showed that the organizations diagnosed in relation to the eleven defined axes are between 11.43% and 58.22%, with the objective of reaching 100% for a high-performance rate in relation to the enterprise architecture.},

abstract = {There is increased interest in smart vehicles acting as both data consumers and producers in smart cities. Vehicles can use smart city data for decision-making, such as dynamic routing based on traffic conditions. Moreover, the multitude of embedded sensors in vehicles can collectively produce a rich data set of the urban landscape that can be used to provide a range of services. Key to the success of this vision is a scalable and private architecture for trusted data sharing. This paper proposes a framework called SpeedyChain, that leverages blockchain technology to allow smart vehicles to share their data while maintaining privacy, integrity, resilience, and non-repudiation in a decentralized and tamper-resistant manner. Differently from traditional blockchain usage (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum), the proposed framework uses a blockchain design that decouples the data stored in the transactions from the block header, thus allowing fast addition of data to the blocks. Furthermore, an expiration time for each block is proposed to avoid large sized blocks. This paper also presents an evaluation of the proposed framework in a network emulator to demonstrate its benefits.},

abstract = {Smart cities emerge in computer science as a topic to cover how the technology of information and communication can be used in the urban centers to monitor its dynamics and allow the improvement of services for the citizens. In these urban centers, different methodologies are used in order to collect data and provide them to applications. These data come from several heterogeneous sources, thus there is an effort to integrate and standardize them before their use. Also, a significant amount of this data has spatio-temporal annotations, which may be used to analyze the city dynamics, such as the mobility flow. Due to these characteristics of the data generated in urban centers, and also the possibilities brought by their use and analyses, this work presents a novel approach to collect, integrate and perform some analysis tasks in mobility data from smart cities. Thus, the SMAFramework can analyze mobility patterns based on a Multi-Aspect Graph (MAG) data structure. To show the potential of the framework, it is proposed a method to analyze the saptio-temporal correlation between data from two different data sources in the same city. Real data collected from social media and a taxi system of the city of New York are used to evaluate this method. The obtained results allowed to understand some of the applicabilities of the framework and also provided some insights on how to use the framework to resolve specific problems when analyzing mobility in urban environments.},

The analysis performed shows that this challenge is one of the least addressed by the Brazilian HCI community and that actions fommenting GranDIHC-BR must be taken continuously, e.g., conferences, competitions, or submission tracks related to GranDIHC-BR challenges less covered by the Brazilian HCI community. From the presented results, one expects to summarize: (1) activities performed in the context of the challenge, (2) reflections around the theme, and (3) to outline a research agenda for the next 5 years.},

abstract = {Brazilian municipalities face challenges to provide efficient public services to their local community. One reason is that cities in the country are different in geography, development, economics, education, and technology environments. In the context of digital transformation, cities are promoting innovative trends by adopting smart cities initiatives, in which Information and Communication Technology (ICT) represents a transversal enabler. Studies and frameworks were applied worldwide to characterize cities' smartness, but few focused on ICT governance, especially in subnational governments. From this perspective, this research, based on the fundamentals of digital government, ICT governance, and smart cities, analyzed ICT governance requisites and practices in fifteen Brazilian municipalities best ranked in the Smart City Connected index. The methodology procedures encompassed cities' official websites and transparency portals searches and information requests based on Brazilian Access Information Law. The results evidenced that most Brazilian cities lack a smart city program approach, several cities did not implement ICT governance mechanisms and were not compliant with the Information Access Law, and ICT governance was not conceived as active transparency in some cities portals. Future studies should focus on developing an ICT governance catalog practices for Brazilian's smart cities and a methodology for ICT governance open database as a smart city approach.},

abstract = {We have been experiencing technological modernization in all segments of cities, which enables the advancement of the smart cities concept through the use of technology to solve current and common problems in cities. Currently, numerous innovative technologies, such as artificial intelligence, big data, the Internet of Things, and sensors, are used to collect and analyze data regarding aspects of cities. Notably, more precise investments in data science make it possible to solve countless problems more safely and efficiently. More than 800 billion dollars are invested annually in the USA to make the urban mobility scenario safer and more efficient. In this perspective, the present work focuses on the application of a mathematical model, Multivariate Linear Regression, to a dataset that contains data about traffic accidents in the USA to understand the aspects, natural or not, that can characterize a higher risk of accidents in the USA.},

abstract = {Throughout the last decade, researchers have proposed different frameworks for studying cities and to guide practitioners in designing, implementing and evaluating smart city strategies. Some of these frameworks have emerged as more salient or relevant than others. This ongoing research paper seeks to understand if the dimensions, components, and elements proposed in the well-recognized framework called 'A comprehensive view of smart city components and elements' originally developed by Gil-Garcia, Pardo, and Nam [5], are present in the Brazilian context and if and how the framework might be revised to better understand the particularities of Brazilian cities. Through the use of a case study, it appears that the framework, in general terms and at the component level of the framework is useful as is, however, the results also indicate that there are some elements that could be reconsidered through elaborations and modifications to the current descriptions of some elements. Future research is needed with additional cities in the Brazilian context and beyond, but this first study seems to indicate the potential practical value of the preliminary elaborated framework.},

abstract = {Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodivergent condition with a wide range of characteristics and support levels. Individuals with ASD can exhibit various combinations of traits such as difficulties in social interaction, communication, and language, alongside restricted interests and repetitive activities. Many adults with ASD live independently due to increased awareness and late diagnoses, which help them manage long-standing challenges. Predictability, clarity, and minimized sensory stimuli are crucial for the daily comfort of autistic individuals. In mobile applications, autistic users face significant cognitive overload compared to neurotypicals, resulting in higher effort and time to complete tasks. Urban mobility apps, essential for daily routines, often overlook the needs of autistic users, leading to cognitive overload issues. This study investigates the accessibility of urban mobility apps for autistic individuals using the Interfaces Accessibility Guide for Autism (GAIA). By evaluating various apps, we have identified a common gap regarding accessibility for people with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). This limitation relates to the absence of a functionality that allows users on the autism spectrum to customize the characteristics of the textual and visual elements of the software, such as changing the text font, altering the font type, and adjusting text colors, as well as native audio guidance within the applications themselves. Currently, the only function in this context is for visually impaired people, which completely changes the user experience in terms of navigation.},

abstract = {Several cities around the world face security problems, such as vehicle theft. Locate and recover these vehicles are challengers for authorities. In smart cities, citizens can collaborate with authorities by sensing urban and environmental data, so-called crowdsensing. This work introduces Crowd-Auto, a crowdsensing approach that utilizes a crowded camera network from houses and commerce to identify vehicle plates, query on official databases and inform the authorities when stolen vehicles are identified. We've developed a prototype and demonstrated that Crowd-Auto is viable for allowing citizens to cooperate and improve security in cities.},

In this context, smarter and more sustainable cities can provide quality of life to the urban population, reducing environmental impacts and inequalities while promoting economic opportunities. Thus, the objective of this article is to identify and analyze initiatives related to sustainable and smart cities in two Brazilian cities, considering their local circumstances. Three attributes (drivers, benefits and challenges) related to the implementation of initiatives in these cities were listed. It was possible to verify that initiatives developed in these cities present significant differences in the conceptions and the results sought. Despite this, it is possible to observe that both cities' initiatives lack a holistic approach and focus on specific solutions not integrated with each other.},

This work, for example, proposes an application in the context of smart cities to analyze data intelligently, knowing that, the concept of Smart Cities involves a wide range of innovations created for the comfort of the citizens. This paper proposes, through data collection, the recognition of vibratory patterns for the classification of surfaces using machine learning techniques. This is an important issue, as it offers a proposal for greater security of bicycle circulation points with the identification of possible irregularities. The analysis of roads surface quality is possible with the use of an accelerometer to collect data important for the audition of tracks. This data is then classified generating information, classified as patterns (asphalt and pavement surfaces). We have performed field data gathering and applied algorithms calculations to classify data to identify the surface the bicycle ridden, with results in percentages of accuracy up to more than 96%.},

Another focus on this theme is how to measure the added value of these initiatives to the population. The Brazilian Network of Smart and Human Cities (RBCIH) was created in order to join both approaches in Brazil, putting together members from academy, private initiative and local (municipality) government. Nowadays, RBCIH is composed by 350 Brazilian cities (in a universe of 5570 cities), indicating that a long-term work has to be executed by RBCIH in Brazil. Two purposes of RBCIH are presenting good practices and evaluating how smart and human a city is. In this work, a methodology is presented for constructing a Brazilian reference model and an evaluation method for smart cities, adherent to the Brazilian reality.},

abstract = {Context: A portion of the users in the S\~{a}o Paulo Metro are people who have physical limitations and need the help of wheelchairs or other similar devices. In this way, the Metro stations have elevators that allow these users to move between the floors of the station. In order, for the elevator to be used, it is necessary for the user to call the operators of the stations, who, in turn, check if the user who is requesting access to the elevator fits the target audience. Problem: This type of request requires manual validation by station operators, causing interruptions in their work routines and delays in passenger travel. Solution: To implement and evaluate artificial intelligence methods for automatic detection of people in wheelchairs or other auxiliary devices. IS Theory: This project was idealized from the perspective of Customer Focus Theory. Method: The You Only Look Once (YOLOv5) neural network was implemented in the Mobility Aids database. Tests were performed considering the original and modified base, composed of a reduced number of images, aiming to assess whether the accuracy of the model remains even with reduced database data. Summary of Results: The results obtained show an average accuracy of more than 92% with the modified database. Contribution: The results corroborated our methodology and we will be able to test in Sao Paulo subway with real images. In a long term, It is expected that by automating such a task, operators will be less overloaded and passengers with reduced mobility will gain more autonomy.},

abstract = {This article presents the findings from the first-round analysis of some initiatives in Porto Alegre, capital of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), following the Smart Cities Initiatives Framework from Chourabi et al. In order to do that, secondary data from official websites and other available and reliable information sources are examined. The data collected combined with the framework factors of smart cities provide a faithful overview of the evolution of Porto Alegre as a city searching to be smarter. The objective here is not making a deep analysis of these initiatives. Instead, this paper aims at giving an overview of the several initiatives taking into account the eight factors produced by the members of the Smart Cities and Service Integration Project research team. The findings demonstrate the potential and the needs of further studies into some of these initiatives by using the interview protocol developed and already used in semi-structured interviews made by this group. This preliminary analysis may lead to the conclusion that the city has fully achieved the requirements of a smart city. However, since most of second data come from official sources that could be considered overly positive.},

abstract = {Electricity companies are accelerating the process of implementing smart grids. Two main components of the smart grid architecture are the communication networks for Distribution Automation (DA) and Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), responsible for communicating with the smart meters installed at the user's premises. This work focuses on planning the wireless backhaul network that supports communication networks for DA and AMI. Backhaul networking involves deploying wireless communication devices to establish wireless links for interconnecting routers, gateways, and automation equipment. Planning these wireless links can be quite challenging due to the geographical diversity of deployment environments, inaccuracies in propagation models in heterogeneous areas (rural, suburban, and urban), and the necessity for detailed databases of soil relief and coverage, which are generally paid and high cost. This paper introduces a satellite imagery-assisted algorithm designed to facilitate efficient link budget analysis for wireless links in smart grid backhaul network planning. The satellite-assisted method classifies the terrain and makes it possible to aggregate loss information from various types of obstructions, such as trees, buildings, and the elevation of the terrain itself. The method uses information from open terrain databases for predictions. The algorithm's performance was validated using real link measurements from a smart grid wireless backhaul network.},

These systems must prioritize maintaining the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of services and data. Examples of vertical applications include smart cities, smart transportation, public services, Industry 4.0, smart grids, smart health, and smart agriculture. Each vertical application has specific security requirements and faces unique threats within the mobile network environment. Thus, it is essential to implement comprehensive and robust security measures. This approach helps minimize the attack surface and effectively manage risks. This survey thoroughly examines mobile networks and their security challenges in vertical applications, shedding light on associated threats and potential solutions. Our study considers the interplay between security considerations in 5G, legacy networks, and vertical applications. We emphasize the challenges, opportunities, and promising directions for future research in this field and the importance of securing vertical applications in the evolving landscape of mobile technology.},

Several challenges arise to enable DTs, which require underlying middleware with advanced services to support the complexities of managing the virtual replicas of real-world entities. In this scenario, this work investigates which middleware strategies and technologies are used for DTs. We carried out a systematic mapping study that analyzed 13 primary studies on middleware for DTs. We shed light on the current state of the art and discuss research opportunities to evolve middleware to support DTs, especially regarding data management, integration, intelligence, management, and security.},

abstract = {Systematic evaluation is crucial to the management and development of smart urban transportation, as it allows transportation planners to better understand the impact of their decisions and design targeted interventions to improve efficiency. Implementation of smart and adaptable public transportation is an important challenge in developing cities and newly industrialized economies where growth characteristics contribute to and can be impacted by factors like overcrowding and travel delays. In this paper, we focus on bus transportation, and present the design and implementation of a 3-layer web-based system for performance evaluation and decision support. This is part of a "Smart Cities" initiative, which is an international collaboration between academia and government. The first layer estimates fundamental indicators such as bus travel time and passenger demands by integrating heterogeneous data sources. A novel bus-stop network is then designed in the second layer, which enables the derivation of passenger patterns in public transit using network analysis. The third layer provides decision support by analyzing causal relationships between indicators. The proposed web-based system called SMARTBUS is being developed and validated with the city of Fortaleza in Brazil. We believe the use of generally available urban transportation data makes our methodology adaptable and customizable for other cities.},

abstract = {Every year, approximately 1,25 million people die in automobilistic accidents worldwide, where 23% are motorcyclists. Amongst the countries that have large motorcycle market, Brazil stands out between the largest ones comprising 22 million motorcycles and 30 million motorcyclists, where these machines are often used in remote or limited access locations such as on fields, dirt roads or isolated streets. In an motorcycle accident, it is common that the motorcyclist loose his consciousness and thus be unable to request help within the so-called 60 minutes "Golden Hour" limit. Considering the evolution and cheapeness of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, applications aimed at saving lives become more and more common, making it easier to connect equipments in a data communication network. In this article, we describe a intelligent helmet equipped with embedded IoT technologies for geolocating and communicating with computer devices such as personal computers and mobile phone about accidented motorcyclists within 60 minutes in real-time. Simulations and tests shown promising results in real experiments where technologies such as sensors, microprocessor and the communication devices embedded in the IoT helmet's enable data colection and processing about the motorcyclist's situation, as well as wireless data transmisson and notification about his current status.},

abstract = {Context: Modern Information Systems require the use of contemporary software systems such as Cyber-Physical Systems, Embedded Systems, and Smart Cities-based Systems, eventually built under the paradigm of the Internet of Things. These Contemporary Software Systems (CSS) add new challenges for their construction, maintainability, and evolution, including the involvement of many actors with the software project and the necessary management of dependencies among hardware/things, software systems, and people. Problem: These technological challenges jeopardize the final quality of modern information systems due to the lack of adequate mechanisms supporting the engineering of CSS. Solution: Continuous Experimentation (CE) deserves some investigation regarding its suitability to mitigate and reduce engineering CSS risks. IS Theory: This research is under the General Systems Theory and is consistent with the Systems Information challenges regarding building smart cities-based systems. Method: To undertake a Structured Literature Review (StLR) supported with snowballing to reveal CE's empirical studies. Results: The StLR identified seven primary studies on CE adoption to support CSS building. Many studies are in the domain of embedded systems and CPS. Besides, the findings allowed us to conjecture a set of challenges and opportunities regarding using CE in CSS engineering. Conclusion: There are emergent technologies to support CE's execution in the context of web-based systems. However, several challenges and gaps surround CE's use for engineering CSS. Furthermore, the lack of software technologies, blueprints, or concrete guidance to promote CE in these software systems can motivate further investigations into its use in engineering the important parts of modern information systems.},

abstract = {The increasing reliance on Systems-of-Systems (SoS) across critical domains, such as emergency response, healthcare, and smart cities, underscores the need for reliable architectures capable of seamlessly accommodating new SoS missions that emerge at runtime. Designing reliable SoS architectures faces challenges in predicting emergent behaviors due to incomplete understanding of Constituent Systems (CS) behaviors at design time, dynamic changes in requirements, and environmental influences. At the same time, it lacks solutions for automatically generating SoS architectural reconfigurations at runtime. The main contribution of this paper is to present an approach named AUTONOMOUS that can automatically generate SoS architectural configurations. AUTONOMOUS refers to a process for functional suitability that extracts information from SoS mission models, engineers a model generator, and finally generates the architectural configurations. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach through a case study in the space domain. Results demonstrate success in generating SoS architectural configurations, indicating that AUTONOMOUS could be further explored as a mechanism to reconfigure SoS architectures automatically at runtime.},

abstract = {In recent years, the search to make cities smart often has been a strategy designed to mitigate problems generated by urban population growth. To improve the population's quality of life and optimize the use of resources and infrastructure, applications in various fields have been developed. Public bus services are widely deployed in cities around the world because they provide cost-effective public transportation. Most of the time the citizens are not provided information about the buses in real-time (location, route, etc). This paper address this lack of information on public bus services and presents ShareBus, an information system to improve urban mobility. The system architecture and its main functionalities are described. A preliminary implementation of the system is also presented which is evaluated through real tests. The system uses the idea of collaboration to obtain and maintain data, either from users or companies, keeping it as much as possible updated.},

VEC can provide and manage computational resources closer to vehicles and end-users, providing access to services at lower latency and meeting the minimum execution requirements for each service type. This survey describes VEC’s concepts and technologies; we also present an overview of existing VEC architectures, discussing them and exemplifying them through layered designs. Besides, we describe the underlying vehicular communication in supporting resource allocation mechanisms. With the intent to overview the risks, breaches, and measures in VEC, we review related security approaches and methods. Finally, we conclude this survey work with an overview and study of VEC’s main challenges. Unlike other surveys in which they are focused on content caching and data offloading, this work proposes a taxonomy based on the architectures in which VEC serves as the central element. VEC supports such architectures in capturing and disseminating data and resources to offer services aimed at a smart city through their aggregation and the allocation in a secure manner.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) represents a computational paradigm where connected devices share a common communication network to interact and provide various applications. In this context, the challenges for IoT and Software Engineering arise from the drive to create smart applications in various domains, such as smart cities, homes, and hospitals. Requirements analysis and software modeling are steps in building IoT systems that aim to ensure a good specification of the system. However, the literature lacks a well-established set of practices for these phases of IoT system development, especially regarding requirements analysis and system modeling. This results in a significant gap in knowledge and standardization of processes. Therefore, a solution that supports these stages of the IoT system development lifecycle is needed. This paper presents ReqM4IoT, a tool that integrates two previously developed techniques: ReqMLSCity, a specific technique for requirements analysis for IoT, and SysIoTML, a specific technique for software modeling for IoT. With this solution, the quality of the software can benefit significantly from using ReqM4IoT, as suggested by the initial evaluation conducted in this work. The evaluation involved five participants with different levels of experience but with a common knowledge base in Software Engineering and IoT. The experiment aimed to evaluate the feasibility, usefulness, and ease of use of the tool in the development of IoT applications. The results indicated that the tool is useful and the participants were able to effectively solve the proposed problem. Although the evaluation pointed out opportunities for improvement, these insights pave the way for further enhancement of ReqM4IoT.},

abstract = {Context: With the advancement of smart cities, the University environment demands surveillance camera systems to increase their monitoring capabilities to prevent malicious behaviors without prohibiting people’s circulation. Problem: Universities have large parking lots with many vehicles and face daily security problems, such as robberies and kidnappings, due to the lack of cameras capable of detecting suspicious behavior and alerting security personnel. Solution: Our approach enhances security in the university environment by developing a system capable of recognizing vehicles and individuals, assessing their proximity, and detecting gestures and actions labeled as suspicious behavior while interoperating with camera systems to alert the appropriate security authorities. Information systems theory: This work was conceived based on the General System Theory to interact with pre-existing heterogeneous systems. It relates to the Technological Frames of Reference theory, which involves the perception and interpretation of real-time object detection technology to monitor, alert, and ensure security. Method: Our research method is an experimental, descriptive investigation of collecting quantitative data, and our evaluation is conducted through the proof of concept. Results: Our artifact demonstrated its feasibility by exhibiting good performance, enabling the detection of pre-defined suspicious behaviors near vehicles with a precision of 94,25% and accuracy of 86,99%. Contributions and Impact in the area of information systems: Our contributions are two-fold: From the organization’s perspective, our security system interoperability, generating interoperable alerts; the artifact to detect suspicious behaviors, protecting people in the University environment. Our approach impacts the three pilars from IS area: People, Process and Technology. Additionally, we provide a dataset of security camera videos in university parking lots.},

abstract = {The metropolitan region of Recife/Brazil presents a scenario where buses routes, lines and schedules are transmitted only visually, limiting the independence in the use of public transportation by visually impaired people. In order to make information about buses schedules in the metropolitan area of Recife accessible to people with visual impairment, an integration was developed between the Synesthesia Vision project and the public transport control system of the metropolitan region of Recife. Synesthesia Vision main subject is the development of technological solutions to help the locomotion of people with visual impairment with freedom and security. The Synesthesia Vision project consists of two subsystems: sensory glasses and a mobile application. Sensory glasses are able to convert obstacles in the way of the user into 3D sound information that can be heard and positioned by their users. The mobile application is responsible by the sensory glasses control and it provides additional information about the environment, such as weather forecasting, the brightness of the environment and buses schedules and arrivals. The Synesthesia Vision project is based on two basic concepts: ubiquitous computing (constant presence of information technology in ordinary people) and intelligent cities (use of technology to develop cities for people). The Synesthesia Vision integration with Recife's public transport control system increased the autonomy and freedom of movement of the blind, because the system, besides warning about obstacles in the way of the user, is able to alert, through sound warnings, about the schedules and arrivals of buses in the bus stop where the user of the system is. The results achieved were promising because volunteers indicated that the device gave more security to walk and go alone to buses stops.},

abstract = {Embedded Systems (ES) are present in several domains like automotive, smart homes, smart cities, industry, and healthcare, to name but a few. ES brings new challenges to designing embedded software that requires a high level of abstraction and being aware of resource consumption, mainly on resource-constrained devices. Modern programming languages like JavaScript (JS) can help solve these issues. However, JS is an interpreted language that demands attention to develop applications considering the balance between performance and resource consumption. In this scenario, this paper introduces an architecture design that proposes to model software for embedded systems as event-driven applications. Our design combines traditional architectures traits of Time-triggered (TT) and Event-triggered (ET) into a framework named JSEVAsync, promoting a hybrid system that explores JavaScript's non-blocking concept as a development interface to structure the algorithms into asynchronous units. As a result, we aid the development of applications with high abstraction levels and better resource consumption. To validate it, we compare C- and JavaScript-based applications, analyze the source code (static code analysis) to extract software quality metrics, and explore the results from the energy consumption perspective. We found that writing code through JSEVAsync can be up to 21% more energy efficient than the traditional method and can improve design-time metrics.},

Relatedly, urban governance is seen as a key element in the development and management of cities and regions. In border regions, where the social, economic, and cultural dynamic is often distinct, developing cities and making them smart presents challenges that can be addressed by binational governance. This study aims to understand how binational governance works in a border region that is seeking to become smart. A qualitative and exploratory study was conducted as a single case on the Brazil-Argentina border program La Frontera. In-depth interviews and document analysis were carried out and subjected to content analysis. The research findings shed light on the internal and external actors, the political and institutional environment, and the factors influencing the binational governance establishment and functioning. A history of disputes between the countries still shapes the dynamic of the border, and the formulation of laws and public policies. Moreover, institutions and actors can influence the focus of governance, and organizations that seek to ensure cooperation and integration do not necessarily guarantee that their principles are practiced.},

abstract = {In the flowering of ubiquitous computing, networks like the Internet of Things and the Internet of Vehicles have contributed to connecting objects and sharing location services in broad environments like smart cities bringing many benefits to citizens. However, these services yield massive and unrestricted mobility data of citizens that pose privacy concerns, among them recovering the identity of citizens with linking attacks. Although several privacy mechanisms have been proposed to solve anonymization problems, there are few studies about their behavior and analysis of the data quality anonymized by these techniques. In this paper, we introduce the anonymization quality. For this, we propose analyzing the mix-zones metrics Amount of Cars on Mix-zone (ACM), Interval of Arrival Time between Cars on Mix-zones (ITM), and Activation Time of the Mix-zone (ATM) for characterizing and evaluating the impacts of anonymization quality over time and space in mobility data. The results showed that mix-zone metrics reflect anonymization behavior and can measure the anonymization quality over time. This insight can contribute significantly to building privacy proposes based on anonymization more effectively than based only on traffic flow. To our knowledge, this is the first work that uses mix-zones metrics analysis to observe the anonymization behavior in quality terms.},

For our preliminary research, we conducted background studies to: (1) determine the main cause of vulnerabilities in MQTT applications; and (2) analyze existing MQTT-based testing frameworks. Our preliminary results confirm that MQTT is most susceptible to malformed packets, and its existing testing frameworks are based on blackbox fuzzing, meaning vulnerabilities are difficult and time-consuming to find. Thus, the aim of my research is to study and develop effective fuzzing strategies for the MQTT protocol, thereby contributing to the development of more robust MQTT applications in IoT and Smart Cities.},

abstract = {Context: With the growth of smart cities, surveillance camera systems have increased their monitoring capacity in different environments. In public Universities, monitoring requires subtle and precise alerts, in order to curb actions that may present a lack of security for the academic community. Problem: Although the detection objects in videos is possible, the high cost of acquiring, installing high-quality cameras and machines capable of executing high-precision models of customized solutions is expensive. In addition, most solutions achieve high precision in controlled environments, with high resolution still images, and focus on objects, which does not portray the reality of surveillance cameras in Universities. Solution: Faced with this problem, the objective is to build a Automatic License Plate Recognition system(ALPR) to control vehicles entering and leaving Universities. It is proposed to interoperate with camera systems in order to alert the competent authorities. Information systems theory: This work was conceived under the General Theory of Systems with regard to interoperate with already existing heterogeneous systems. Furthermore, as part of the theory of socio-technical systems, this approach aims to improve the performance of the organization, offering improvements in the productivity of the task due to the alerts of the offered approach. Method: This research is descriptive and its evaluation is done through proof of concept. Results: The artifact developed showed good performance, allowing to recognize license plates in surveillance cameras with 76.6% accuracy. Contributions and Impact in the area of information systems: Our main contribution is the artifact to detect vehicles. A secondary contribution is our dataset with Old and Mercosul Plaques versions. Such method impacts the three pilars from IS area: People, Process and Technology.},

abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have become the most used and efficient way to identify and classify objects in a scene. CNNs are today fundamental not only for autonomous vehicles, but also for Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cities or smart homes. Vendors are developing low-power, efficient, and low-cost dedicated accelerators to allow the execution of the computational-demanding CNNs even in embedded applications with strict power and cost budgets.Google's Coral Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) is one of the latest low power accelerators for CNNs. In this paper we investigate the reliability of TPUs to atmospheric neutrons, reporting experimental data equivalent to more than 30 million years of natural irradiation. We analyze the behavior of TPUs executing atomic operations (standard or depthwise convolutions) with increasing input sizes as well as eight CNN designs typical of embedded applications, including transfer learning and reduced data-set configurations. We found that, despite the high error rate, most neutrons-induced errors only slightly modify the convolution output and do not change the CNNs detection or classification. By reporting details about the fault model and error rate, we provide valuable information on how to evaluate and improve the reliability of CNNs executed on a TPU.},

abstract = {In recent years, we are facing a significant increase in the collection and availability of geospatial data. This type of data is paramount to help decision makers in different contexts, such as smart cities, mobile social networks, and e-commerce. In addition, the behavior of mobile users can be extracted and exploited to improve the quality of the services offered by mobile providers. However, raw location data needs to be semantically enriched to be useful, which is an arduous task because it requires queries on different data sources of different formats and complex joins. To mitigate this difficulty, this work proposes MoreData, a flexible and expandable framework for the semantic enrichment of geospatial data. The framework accepts different input formats, provides connectors to different sources (APIs, Relational Database, Fast Search Engine Tool, and Open Street Map), and is easy to extend to new sources. To evaluate the framework's benefits, we use it to enrich a real database comprised of thousands of mobile users' locations with data. We observe that the adoption of the framework leads to less time and effort in the data enrichment process, saving time for the more important tasks, such as building and analyzing models.},

At the same time, the popularization of devices with attached sensors has allowed the obtaining of a large volume of data with spatiotemporal information from different entities. In this sense, we are faced with a large volume of vehicular mobility traces being recorded. Those traces provide unprecedented opportunities to understand the dynamics of vehicular mobility and provide data-driven solutions. In this article, we give an overview of the main publicly available vehicular mobility traces; then, we present the main issues for preprocessing these traces. Also, we present the methods used to characterize and model mobility data. Finally, we review existing proposals that apply the hidden knowledge extracted from the mobility trace for vehicular networks. This article provides a survey on studies that use vehicular mobility traces and provides a guideline for the proposition of data-driven solutions in the domain of vehicular networks. Moreover, we discuss open research problems and give some directions to undertake them.},

abstract = {Vehicular Ad-Hoc Networks (VANET) are the creation of several vehicles communicating with each other in order to create a network capable of communication and data exchange. One of the most promising methods for security and trust amongst vehicular networks is the usage of Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). However, current implementations of PKI as a security solution for determining the validity and authenticity of vehicles in a VANET is not efficient due to the usage of large amounts of delay and computational overhead. In this paper, we investigate the potential of PKI when predictively and preemptively passing along certificates to roadside units (RSU) in an effort to lower delay and computational overhead in a dynamic environment. We look to accomplish this through utilizing fog computing and propose a new protocol to pass certificates along the projected path.},

abstract = {Context: Smart Cities and other Systems-of-Systems (SoS) have attracted attention due to their potential for innovation in the services provided to the society. SoS are composed of several independent systems and often support critical domains. As such, failures can cause serious damage or even financial losses that can be avoided by performing quality assurance (QA). Among QA techniques, software testing is an essential activity that checks software behaviors against a subset of parameters. However, testing SoS can be even more complex since several other factors further elevate the complexity of the test, such as interoperability links and multiple independent systems. Goal: Our goal in this paper is to analyze the current state of research on software testing for SoS domain. Method: A protocol was formulated and executed according to the guidelines for performing systematic literature mappings in Software Engineering. Results: This study identified the tools, approaches, methods and processes that the literature has addressed to test SoS. Conclusions: Software Testing for SoS still faces several problems and presents many questions to be answered, particularly in the definition of processes and metrics.},

As a consequence, real encounters, especially with non-related people tend to not be encouraged or even exciting anymore. Aware that mobile devices become more popular and powerful considering pervasiveness and ubiquitousness, we strategically decided to use technology in order to support and promote people gathering in public spaces. In this paper, we present Selfie Cafe, an Urban Computing application for leveraging socialization. The application was deployed in the wild to see how people would react to it in specific places where socialization would be expected but was not happening. Results of the Selfie Cafe installation show that it helped setting a more playful mood in the place, an increase in the time spent by people in there as well as supporting interactions among locals, acquaintances and strangers.},

abstract = {High crime rates have become a public health problem in many important cities, according to World Health Organization. Many researchers have been developing algorithms to predict crime occurrences to tackle this problem. The smart cities' environment can provide us enough ubiquitous data, e.g., traffic flow, human mobility, and Points of Interest (POI) information, to feed those predictive policing algorithms and reflect city dynamics. POIs data provide essential information such as geographical location, category, customer reviews, and busy hours. Recent studies have shown that POI geographical locations are useful for predictive policing. In this paper, we aim at predicting crimes in a delimited region around the POIs of a city with new environmental features. We investigate the relevance of POIs location and the semantic and the temporal features from POIs data in our problem. We also propose and analyze different machine learning approaches to train prediction functions based on these features and conduct experiments on real crime data over multiple years. The experiments demonstrate that the popular time feature is more relevant than the historical information about the number of crimes around a POI, but both information is much less critical than the spatio-temporal information. This work is the first that studies the popular time feature extracted from POIs data and historical criminal information for predictive policing from the authors' knowledge.},

abstract = {Context. The large-scale use of microservices and their increasing adoption in the industry in recent years has motivated researches on the most diverse aspects related to microservice-based development. However, as it is a relatively new topic, there is still no consolidated body of knowledge in the area. Objective. The present work intends to investigate the current state of research on microservices based on the formulation of six research questions covering fundamental aspects, such as: main interest topics and adopted standards, techniques and tools have been used and application areas. Method. From four digital libraries, 22 secondary studies were selected as a data source, which were analyzed and synthesized in the present study following the proposed research protocol. Results. Among the main topics of interest addressed, we highlight researches related to the applicability of microservice architecture, both by industry and academia. Results indicated that standards focus on challenges related to communication have been the most commonly considered by researchers of the area. Finally, the predominance in the use of the Docker container and the presence of DevOps practices in the automation of operations are noteworthy. Conclusions. The present mapping study points to some directions of research based on the identified gaps, such as modeling and testing of microservice applications, and addressing security aspects. Another promising point to be explored involves the combined use of microservice architecture with other related concepts such as IoT, smart cities, FOG computing and reactive systems, in order to reinforce the use of microservices, as well as creating new solutions and challenges to be researched.},

Software-intensive SoS (SiSoS) has become a hotspot in the last years, from both the research and industry viewpoints. Indeed, various aspects of our lives and livelihoods have progressively become dependent on some sort of Software-intensive SoS. This is the case of SiSoS found in different areas as diverse as energy, healthcare, manufacturing, and transportation; and applications that address societal needs, e.g. environmental monitoring, distributed energy grids, emergency coordination, global traffic control, and smart cities. Moreover, ubiquitous platforms such as the Internet of Things and nascent kinds of SoS such as Cyber-Physical SoSs are accelerating the deployment of Software-intensive SoS in the near future. Definitely, the unique characteristics of Software-intensive SoS raise a grand research challenge for the future of software-reliant systems in our industry and society due to its intrinsic features, among which evolutionary development and emergent behavior.

abstract = {Sensor networks are a fast-evolving technology used for a variety of applications, ranging from environmental monitoring to cyber-physical systems (CPS) and IoT, including applications designed to support smart cities. The widespread use of sensor networks rises new challenges to data management and storage. The development of data storage systems is a hard task due to the specific nature of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and the lack of a common general purpose development framework. Software component models provide an appropriate level of system abstraction, reducing the development complexity and improving productivity. In this paper we propose RCBM, a Reusable Component-based Model for wireless sensor network storage simulation. RCBM promotes software reuse from existing components to improve the efficiency of system development and evaluation. RCBM has been implemented on the NS2 simulator and experimental results show that RCBM is more flexible than previous component-based models for WSNs. Due to its general-purpose approach, RCBM can be applied to develop simulation code for a wide range of WSN storage models, reducing the development effort.},

abstract = {The discovering of patterns regarding how, when, and where users interact with mobile applications reveals important insights for mobile service providers. In this work, we exploit for the first time a real and large-scale dataset representing the records of mobile application usage of 5,342 users during 2014. The data was collected by a software agent, installed at the users’ smartphones, which monitors detailed usage of applications. First, we look for general patterns of how users access some of the most popular mobile applications in terms of frequency, duration, diversity, and data traffic. Next, we mine the dataset looking for temporal patterns in terms of when and how often accesses occur. Finally, we exploit the location of each access to detect users’ points of interest and location-based communities. Based on the results, we derive a model to generate synthetic datasets of mobile application usage and evaluate solutions to predict the next application to be launched. We also discuss a series of implications of the findings regarding telecommunication services, mobile advertisements, and smart cities. This is the first time this dataset is used, and we also make it publicly available for other researchers.},

In such context, the need of runtime self-adaptations to cope with both user needs and environmental changes brings Dynamic Software Product Lines (DSPL) as a suitable solution. However, DSPL implementation itself is challenging, which demands a proper modeling. In this sense, the literature still lacks of means of choosing the modeling technique that best fits a given domain. This paper tackles such problem by defining a criteria for rank such techniques, which is used for ranking a set DSPL modeling techniques found in the literature.},

abstract = {Sensor networks have become ubiquitous -- being present from personal smartphones to smart cities deployments -- and are producing large volumes of data at increasing rates. Distributed event stream processing systems, in its turn, are a specific kind of systems that help us to parallelize event processing. Therefore, they provide us capabilities to produce quick insights and decisions, in near real-time, on top of multiple data streams. However, current systems for large scale processing do not focus on Internet of Things and Sensor Network workloads, which makes the performance decrease quickly as the workload size increases. In order to process large scale events with acceptable latency percentiles and high throughput, special systems are needed, such as distributed event stream processing systems. In this work, we propose an architecture for Internet of Things data workloads, in a combination of sensor networks data sources and distributed event stream processing systems, focused on smart grid data profiles. In our evaluations, the system was able to process up to 45K messages per second using 8 processing nodes, while providing stable latencies for micro-batches above 30 seconds.},

abstract = {Contemporary software systems, such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Industry 4.0, and Smart Cities are new technology paradigms that offer challenges for their construction since they are calling into question our traditional form of developing software. They are a promising paradigm for the integration of devices and communications technologies. It is leading to a shift from the classical monolithic view of development where stakeholder receive a software product at the end (that we have been doing for decades), to software systems materialized through physical objects interconnected by networks and with embedded software to support daily activities. We need therefore to revisit our way of developing software systems and start to consider the particularities required by these new sorts of applications. This paper presents research toward the definition of a framework to support the systems engineering of IoT applications, where we evolved the Zachman's Framework as an alternative to the organization of this architecture. The activities were two folded to address this goal: a) we identified leading concerns of IoT applications, recovered from technical literature, practitioners and a Government Report, in different studies; b) we structured the IoT paradigm in different facets. These activities provided 14 significant concerns and seven facets that together represent the engineering challenges to be faced both by research and practice towards the advancement of IoT in practice.},

abstract = {An increasing interest in researching the development, integration, composition, and evolution of large-scale, software-intensive systems (LSSIS) have been observed in the last years. These systems are presented in different domains as connected health, industry 4.0, military, smart cities, smart grids, and smart agriculture. These systems are realized through the cooperation among heterogeneous, independent, highly distributed, individual, and heterogeneous systems to achieve their business goals. For the success of these larger systems, their individual parts must interoperate among them allowing the execution of more complex functionalities. However, there are many concerns that software engineers must overcome during the composition of these systems, that can be related to (i) the misunderstanding of data formats, data semantic, procedures, contracts, standards, quality, and interfaces structures provided by individual systems; and (ii) the absence of high-level architectures to analyze, comprehend, and guide how interoperability can be addressed. The goal of this work is to present a typology of existing and proven strategies for achieving interoperability. Strategies were identified through a systematic search in scientific databases and patterns repositories. The selected strategies were categorized according to the level of interoperability they support, namely, technical, syntactic, semantic, and organizational. In each level, the strategies were divided by the type of solution their propose, i.e., technique, and architectural styles, patterns, and tactics. Moreover, statements explaining how each strategy address interoperability are given. Results of this work can be used by architects to identify and understand solutions for achieving interoperability requirements during the composition of larger systems. The resulting typology in this study is the first step to consolidate a patterns-language for interoperability in software architectures.},

abstract = {Recent advances in sensor technologies and instrumentation have led to an extraordinary growth of data sources and streaming applications. A wide variety of devices, from smart phones to dedicated sensors, have the capability of collecting and streaming data at unprecedented rates. Typical applications include smart cities &amp; built environments for instance, where sensor-based infrastructures continue to increase in scale and variety. Analysis of stream data involves: (i) execution of a number of operations on a time/sample window - e.g. min./max./avg., filtering, etc; (ii) a need to combine a number of such operations together; (iii) event-driven execution of operations, generally over short time durations; (iv) operation correlations across multiple data streams. The use of such operations does not fit well in the per-hour or per-minute cloud billing models currently available from cloud providers - with some notable exceptions (e.g. Amazon AWS). In this paper we discuss how micro-billing and sub-second resource allocation can be used in the context of streaming applications and how micro-billing models bring challenges to capacity management on cloud infrastructures.},

abstract = {Contemporary systems are increasingly complex, with both large codebases and constantly changing environments which make them challenging to develop, deploy and manage. We consider two recent efforts to tackle this complexity: microservices and emergent software. Microservices have gained recent popularity in industry, in which monoliths of software are broken down into compositions of single-objective, end-to-end services running on HTTP which can be scaled out on cloud hosting systems. From the research community, the emergent systems concept demonstrates promise in using real-time learning to autonomously compose and optimise software systems from small building blocks, rapidly finding the best behavioural composition to match the current deployment conditions. We argue that emergent software and microservice architectures have strong potential for synergy in complex systems, offering mutually compatible lessons in dealing with complexity via scale-out design and real-time client-tailored behaviour. We explore self-designing microservices, built with emergent software, to demonstrate the complementary boundaries of both concepts - and how future intersections may offer novel architectures that lie at a compelling point between human- and machine-designed systems. We present the conceptual synergy and demonstrate a specific microservice architecture for a smart city example where scoped microservices are continually self-composed according to the demands of the applications and operating environment. For the purpose of reproducibility of the study, we make available all the code used in the evaluation of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP) involve designing least-cost delivery routes to visit a geographically-dispersed set of customers. Over the past 60 years, this class of problems has been the subject of considerable work, summing up to thousands of articles. In 2017, we can reasonably say that the classical capacitated VRP (with only capacity constraints) is fairly well solved by metaheuristic techniques. Yet, the research on VRPs keeps on expanding even further, as a consequence of the increasing diversity of applications, which bring forth new difficult constraints, objectives, and combined decisions to account for customers needs, vehicle and network restrictions, and to better integrate VRP optimization in the decision chains. Moreover, with the advent of collaborative logistics, green initiatives, smart cities, multi-modal transport, in contexts where multiples stakeholders and conflicting objectives have to be considered jointly, or in the presence of dynamic problems with a short response time, the efficient resolution of these problems becomes even more critical. In this talk, we will review some of the most challenging and recent VRP variants, and examine the heuristic solution techniques which are developed to tackle them. We will study the close connections between the structure of the problem decision sets, and the associated solution methods, showing how modern heuristics can effectively perform a search in a reduced space, defined by fewer groups of decision variables. Finally, a key challenge is to progress towards unified solution methods, which are not tailored for one single problem, but instead designed to solve a wide collection of problem variants with different constraints and objectives. For this purpose, we expose some of the main principles of the Unified Hybrid Genetic Search (UHGS), which has been recently extended to obtain state-of-the-art results --in a single code base-- for more than 50 difficult variants of vehicle routing and arc routing problems.},

abstract = {Planners and social psychologists have suggested that the recognizability of the urban environment is linked to people's socio-economic well-being. We build a web game that puts the recognizability of London's streets to the test. It follows as closely as possible one experiment done by Stanley Milgram in 1972. The game picks up random locations from Google Street View and tests users to see if they can judge the location in terms of closest subway station, borough, or region. Each participant dedicates only few minutes to the task (as opposed to 90 minutes in Milgram's). We collect data from 2,255 participants (one order of magnitude a larger sample) and build a recognizability map of London based on their responses. We find that some boroughs have little cognitive representation; that recognizability of an area is explained partly by its exposure to Flickr and Foursquare users and mostly by its exposure to subway passengers; and that areas with low recognizability do not fare any worse on the economic indicators of income, education, and employment, but they do significantly suffer from social problems of housing deprivation, poor living conditions, and crime. These results could not have been produced without analyzing life off- and online: that is, without considering the interactions between urban places in the physical world and their virtual presence on platforms such as Flickr and Foursquare. This line of work is at the crossroad of two emerging themes in computing research - a crossroad where "web science" meets the "smart city" agenda.},
