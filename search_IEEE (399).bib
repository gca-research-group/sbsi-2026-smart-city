  abstract={With the objective of reducing energy consumption in city environments, there is a need to replace outdated street lighting systems that still rely on the old high-pressure sodium technology for more efficient lighting devices. The inefficiency is caused by the lack of feedback regarding the status of the lamp, the power being drawn from the low-voltage distribution network, and the lack of control over the intensity. The progressive replacement of lighting devices offers a unique opportunity of using individual lighting controllers as access points in a larger smart city IoT backbone infrastructure. Smart metering solutions require a proper network infrastructure, which is normally too costly to deploy from scratch and could even cause a take-back effect, thus nullifying the benefits of energy monitoring. Previously proposed solutions for a smart city's network include using a mesh-type network based on Zigbee or point-to-point LoRAWAN-based solutions, which could not be entirely suitable for a noisy environment like a smart city. This research paper proposes an optimal IoT solution for smart cities that uses IEEE 802.15.4 6LoWPAN mesh networks with a suitable routing proto-col to achieve low latency and high energy efficiency. This solution is ideal for smart metering applications that require near-real-time data processing with a small to moderate data rate. This paper also proposes using an open-source modulation technique to reduce initial deployment costs and increase interoperability. The proposed solution provides a reliable, efficient, and cost-effective approach to modernizing street lighting systems in smart cities and a backbone infrastructure.},

  abstract={A smart city provides services to citizens through technological tools that analyze data from several subdomains for decision-making. Thus, a smart city platform is essential for integrating the city's subdomains and using data efficiently. To effectively tackle challenges in a multi-domain scenario, a flexible and adaptable solution that harnesses artificial intelligence efficiently is essential. This work presents UFCity, a data-centric, microservices-based solution with a three-layer network structure (edge, fog, and cloud computing). UFCity processes, stores, and analyzes data at each level, using an approach based on AI-equipped microservices on the cloud to extend services to citizens. A prototype was developed and tested in various usage scenarios to serve as a proof of concept. Furthermore, an experimental design $n=3^{k=3}$ was employed to evaluate the solution's performance based on message quantity, message group size for data fusion, and outlier removal methods for some elements. We conclude that UFCity is an advantageous alternative for managing city data, meeting requirements, and demonstrating high workload capacity.},

  abstract={In the Smart Cities context, a plethora of Middleware Platforms has been proposed to support applications execution and data processing. However, just a few of them have explored the overall Smart Cities computing environment. The vast majority focuses on specific domains, typically presenting a sensor-acquisition architecture for processing in Cloud Computing. Most recent initiatives try to include Cloud Computing and Edge Computing, while few of them use the three computing levels (Cloud, Fog, and Edge). Besides, many of these platforms do not define the services that should be deployed at each level, nor how the developer can better use each feature. This work fulfills this gap presenting an architecture for applications classifying services implemented by a typical Computing Environment of Smart Cities. Our architecture uses all the computational levels (Cloud, Fog, Edge) of a city infrastructure, and it defines how to deploy each type of service at each level. We also present an example of the proposed architecture that we are implementing in the city of Natal, where some evaluative tests have been carried out.},

  abstract={The paradigm of the post-industrial society of the 21st century, based on the diffusion of knowledge through Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs), coupled with the growing demands of contemporary society, exposes public management in an open and transparent scenario of thought-provoking challenge concerning the effectiveness of its actions. This scenario requires efforts from the public manager in order to reorganize its institutional arrangement, inserting innovations that allow the systematic competitiveness not only of the public sector, but of the other participating members of the urban experience. In the meantime, the concept of Human Smart Cities presents itself as a push element of transformation that aims to overcome this gap through the fruitful articulation and interaction of the public admnistration, the universities, the business and financial sectors and other members of civil society [1], using ICTs as the connectivity tool between these elements and the management of the co-design and co-creation activities. Such a transformation to innovate democracy requires an effort from the main players regarding the need to actively participate in the vision, strategy and implementation of the goals that characterize a Human Smart City that the authors present as a contribution to face the current Brazilian crisis. Given this context, the present study seeks to present strategies, methodologies and best practices for sensitization, civic engagement, social empowerment and sustainable motivation to participate in the co design and co-creation of a Human Smart City. Therefore, a systematic analysis was conducted, illustrated with the best practices implemented in the "Natal Human Smart City Program". Living Labs are used as a methodological basis for the Urban Living Lab - the engine of the city’s socioeconomic development - based on its innovation ecosystem, illustrated by the collaboration between the City Hall of Natal and the Federal University of Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN), through the Digital Metropolis Institute (IMD).},

  abstract={A Service-Level Agreement (SLA) usually refers to computational services (e.g., cloud/web services), indicating contract goals and expected Quality of Service (QoS), recently extended for transportation problems called Logistics SLA. Transportation problems are being systematically studied for Smart City (SC) applications due to its huge importance: public transportation services, drone delivery services, battery recharging for electric vehicles, and also transportation for private companies considering real-time traffic information. Many of these transportations problems involve not only one-way deliveries, but also pickups, forming a set of routes with desired QoS such as maximum route length/time, delivery/pickup sequences and time-windows. In order to achieve all desired QoS, while minimizing routing distances, this problem can be seen as an extension of the challenging Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), which is known to be NP-Hard. Computational intelligence strategies such as metaheuristics are often employed to find near-optimal solutions in short computational times. In this paper, we deal with a practical industrial problem involving employees transportation to a workplace in a Brazilian metropolis, involving minimization of operational costs, achievement of QoS requirements and visualization of the routes.},

  abstract={Currently, people are very concerned with the quality of life in their cities, especially with the level of air quality. Due to this concern, this work aims to analyze the communication of Internet of Things (IoT) devices using Long-Range technology (LoRa) with the Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) protocol for monitoring air quality and smart cities. In this context, factors such as distance between nodes, types of antennas and different Spreading Factor (SF) are considered. In addition, metrics Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI), Latency, Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) and Packet Loss Rate (PDR) are collected from a real scenario in the city of Teresina in Brazil. Furthermore, a simulation to analyze the lifetime of the sensor nodes using energy consumption is run. Results show that the LoRaWAN technology proved to be a viable option, with low cost, low energy consumption, covering a distance of up to 2000 meters with packet loss rate of 0.3%, low SNR and latency of 23ms, with shipment of up to 12000 packages with node life of 2081 days, reaching a total consumption of 0.0105 mWh, even with all the barriers of the real scenario.},

The study considers a knowledge-based taxonomy defined for IoE environments and supports the full realization of IoE applications through a knowledge management strategy.

  abstract={Automotive world is changing with the introduction of Intelligent Vehicles. Today, an increasing number of vehicles may send data to the Internet, helping car manufacturer to implement the Industry 4.0 paradigm. The collected data during the lifetime of the vehicles can be used to improve both product and production facilities. Moreover, the availability of additional data coming from onboard sensors could be used to obtain information about the environment surrounding the vehicle. The Smart City scenario includes an extraordinary number of new sensors (in urban area) and vehicles can be thought as additional mobile sensors. This paper describes the prototype of a Vehicle-to-Cloud interface with OBD-II (On Board Diagnostic) communication, 3G/4G connectivity, and LoRaWAN [used as backup channel]. LoRaWAN infrastructures are largely diffused in Smart Cities and they can provide a suitable alternative to cover some areas when 3G/4G fails. Last, considering the Smart City scenarios, this paper discusses the application constrains and design directions to achieve a correct integration between LoRaWAN infrastructure and the Internet of Intelligent Vehicles.},

  abstract={Integrating low-power profile networks, such as LPWAN (Low Power Wide Area Network) and WPAN (Wireless Personal Area Networks), will economically enable new IoT (Internet of Things) applications for SC (Smart Cities). The technologies LPWAN LoRA and WPAN BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) are found in low-cost devices making use of unlicensed frequencies. The merge of their features would allow the emergence of applications that transmit long-range data (up to 45 km) using low energy consumption, low manufacturing cost, and simplified implementation, eliminating mobile operators dependence. In this work, we integrate LPWAN and WPAN using LoRa and BLE in a paradigm of Fog/Edge Computing, allowing the execution of the procedures at the edges of the network, making possible the transmission of only consolidated data to the cloud. We implemented a LoRa-BLE testbed using Lopy4 - Pycon, and simulated SC scenarios using LoRaSim. The set of results obtained by the testbed and the simulation allows us to evaluate the viability of merge LoRa-BLE to IoT SC applications.},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={Among the innovative services provided by smart cities initiatives, emergencies management systems have stood out as a mean to prevent the occurrence of disasters in urban areas, detecting emergencies as soon as possible and triggering response actions. For that, such systems may rely on multiple emergencies detection units spread over a city, which will be used to detect abnormal situations and report them for further processing. Although the use of multi-sensors hardware units seems to be reasonable to detect a lot of emergency-related variables such as temperature, humidity, smoke, and toxic gases, cities may have different geographical zones concerning the potential negative impacts (risk) that an emergency may have until it is properly mitigated. Therefore, such risk associated to those zones should guide the deployment of emergencies detection units, but their computation is not straightforward and it may depend on different parameters. In this context, this paper proposes a mathematical model to compute mitigation zones in any city, taking as reference the availability of response centers retrieved from open geospatial databases, notably hospitals, fire departments, and police stations. An algorithm is defined to compute a critical index to each zone, which will be exploited to indicate the proportional number of detection units that should be allocated according to the total number of available units. Initial results for the city of Porto, Portugal, are presented, which are discussed when concerning the construction of practical emergencies management systems.},

However, the focus on technological innovation often overlooks important concerns about digital equality, privacy, bias, and ethical governance. This paper aims to foster a shifting in the narrative towards these less discussed areas, arguing that the true measure of a smart city's success lies not only in its technological capabilities but also in its commitment to inclusivity, privacy, trust, and ethical integrity. This paper examines the inclusivity of smart services, emphasising the need for digital equality while also discussing privacy regulations and the role of trust in fostering citizen engagement. Additionally, it explores how decision-making can perpetuate inequalities and the importance of transparent governance. Such important discussions address ethical and social implications, which ultimately contribute to a more nuanced understanding of smart cities and advocates for policies and practices that prioritise social equity alongside technological innovations.},

  abstract={As an important component of Smart Cities, transportation system plays a critical role to address the sustainability and mobility of the society. One key concern is that the number of vehicles continuously increases faster than the available infrastructure, as well as the traffic congestion is a difficult issue to deal with. Several solutions to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have been proposed to identify congestion and re-route the vehicles afterwards. In this direction, this work introduces SPARTAN, a fully distributed ITS solution, which notifies drivers about congested areas through Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication and employs a real-time decision making mechanism used to reroute vehicles to avoid the congested areas. Simulation results show the effectiveness of SPARTAN in calculating new routes and disseminating them to vehicles that approaching a congestion area. As a consequence, SPARTAN reduces the travel time and the congestion time in urban scenarios when compared to existing approaches.},

  pages={5509-5520},
  abstract={People use smart transportation systems to move around in smart cities, producing a massive amount of valuable mobility data. Although this characteristic enables the development of many intelligent applications, it can expose users to privacy threats. Location privacy is an issue addressed in many mobility contexts, in which there is a privacy concern. Currently, there are some proposals to tackle this problem, and some questions naturally arise: Are these proposals suitable for a dynamic environment, such as smart mobility? What are the impacts of mobility on privacy? In this article, we answer these questions to explore location privacy in smart mobility considering open and online data, one of the fundamental pillars of smart city platforms. We have evidenced the hypothesis that mobility can impact privacy approaches of anonymization (mix zones) and obfuscation (GEO-I) in the context of smart mobility. For this, we performed experiments to characterize and find similarities in the statistical distributions extracted from two stay points metrics, which operate as substrates to build location privacy protection mechanisms. We use an accuracy metric to quantify the datasets’ distributions that matched each other. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of seven real datasets of mono or multimodal mobility. The results showed that the stay point count metric reached 100% and 83.3% accuracy for coarse-grained (person and vehicle) and fine-grained (bus, taxi, and person) data. Additionally, we show a similarity between distributions for the same vehicle type for mono and multimodal datasets. Results suggest that privacy has a high dependence on mobility in different granularity levels.},

  abstract={Solutions for smart cities are being created everywhere in the world, using technology to improve urban infrastructure and make urban centers more efficient and better to live. In this way, the proposal of this work is based on the capture of information through sensors in a smart city context. Sensors are coupled on a bicycle and connected to an Arduino and a Mobile Application. After this, the captured data are saved in a cloud database, displayed and analyzed through a Web Application. In this work, our methodology is organized in three main phases: (i) data collection of the surface in which the cyclist is traveling, and the ultrasonic distance sensor, to identify areas of risk based on the proximity of objects from bicycle, (ii) data analysis and data classification, using machine learning concepts and (iii) data visualization, using map views in a Web Application. This methodology allows the identification of injury risk situations to cyclists. The main contributions of this work are surfaces classification with data collected by the accelerometer and ultrasonic sensor generating useful information through simple data. Real experiments were conducted at Fortaleza (Ceara, Brazil) and Aracati (Ceara, Brazil). This work brings new perspectives to collaborative data collection for identification of injury risk situations to cyclists, since it can be used to suggest routes based on these risk indicators and offer a secure environment for cyclists.},

  abstract={Smart urban transportation management can be considered as a multifaceted big data challenge. It strongly relies on the information collected into multiple, widespread, and heterogeneous data sources as well as on the ability to extract actionable insights from them. Besides data, full stack (from platform to services and applications) Information and Communications Technology (ICT) solutions need to be specifically adopted to address smart cities challenges. Smart urban transportation management is one of the key use cases addressed in the context of the EUBra-BIGSEA (Europe-Brazil Collaboration of Big Data Scientific Research through Cloud-Centric Applications) project. This paper specifically focuses on the City Administration Dashboard, a public transport analytics application that has been developed on top of the EUBra-BIGSEA platform and used by the Municipality stakeholders of Curitiba, Brazil, to tackle urban traffic data analysis and planning challenges. The solution proposed in this paper joins together a scalable big and fast data analytics platform, a flexible and dynamic cloud infrastructure, data quality and entity matching algorithms as well as security and privacy techniques. By exploiting an interoperable programming framework based on Python Application Programming Interface (API), it allows an easy, rapid and transparent development of smart cities applications.},

  abstract={The proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) devices demands robust structures for processing and storing trillion gigabytes of data. Part of those data can be used for evaluating the solution's effectiveness and to improve it. Hence, a reliability analysis based on the solution's produced data is important to validate it and find weaknesses to solve. Therefore, in this paper we process the data generated by a sensor-based smart parking system to present a reliability analysis. This system is implemented placing ultrasonic sensors, a web service, the FIWARE platform, and a mobile application to Android devices, in a three-layer architecture. We evaluate how many errors occur in a certain time window, the success and error rates and the most common kind of error produced. Finally, we conclude that even with some instability our sensing approach is effective with a worst case success rate greater than 96%. Moreover, we find out that our system works in an open environment with tropical climate conditions.},

  abstract={In the Smart Cities context, a plethora of Middle-ware Platforms had been proposed to support applications execution and data processing. Despite all the progress already made, the vast majority of solutions have not met the requirements of Applications’ Runtime, Development, and Deployment when related to Scalability. Some studies point out that just 1 of 97 (1%) reported platforms reach this all this set of requirements at same time. This small number of platforms may be explained by some reasons: i) Big Data: The huge amount of processed and stored data with various data sources and data types, ii) Multi-domains: many domains involved (Economy, Traffic, Health, Security, Agronomy, etc.), iii) Multiple processing methods like Data Flow, Batch Processing, Services, and Microservices, and 4) High Distributed Degree: The use of multiple IoT and BigData tools combined with execution at various computational levels (Edge, Fog, Cloud) leads applications to present a high level of distribution. Aware of those great challenges, we propose Sapparchi, an integrated architectural model for Smart Cities applications that defines multi-processing levels (Edge, Fog, and Cloud). Also, it presents the Sapparchi middleware platform for developing, deploying, and running applications in the smart city environment with an osmotic multi-processing approach that scales applications from Cloud to Edge. Finally, an experimental evaluation exposes the main advantages of adopting Sapparchi.},

  abstract={The adoption of sensors-based monitoring systems supported by Internet of Things technologies has opened new possibilities for data retrieving and processing in urban areas. Among such possibilities, emergencies management is expected to play an important role in how modern cities will evolve, reducing the negative impacts of critical events and improving the quality of life perceived by their inhabitants. Actually, when an emergency is detected and alerted, emergency vehicles, notably ambulances, fire trucks, police cars and transit agents vehicles, should be quickly assigned to respond to that situation, as soon as possible. In this context, we propose a dynamic algorithm to automatically assign emergency vehicles in smart city scenarios, exploiting for that a sensors-based emergency detection system to provide emergency alerts. The proposed algorithm can then be used to quickly assign a number of emergency vehicles in the first moments of an emergency, which can potentially save lives and improve existing crisis management applications in smart cities.},

  abstract={Internet of Things (IoT) is pushing the Internet to the next level, bringing the number of connected devices to an unprecedented amount, creating new services and improving old services like the metering system. The advanced meter infrastructure (AMI) measures, collects and analyzes the distribution and consumption of utilities such as water, electricity, and gas, which are of vital importance for the implementation of smart cities. In this paper, we employ LoRa, which is a low power wide area network technology (LPWAN), for the communication of meter devices and network server, and we study the coexistence of two kinds of messages: regular and alarm events. Our focus is on the analysis of the alarm events, which can be characterized by emergency situations and require ultra-reliability. We investigated the feasibility of the alarms for a smart metering scenario through simulation campaigns and a mathematical model. By assigning a different spreading factor (SF) to the device depending on whether the event is regular or alarm, we assessed the system performance. We evaluate the availability, reliability, and quantity of alarms that satisfy the restricted requirements of alarms events and do not compromise the performance of regular events. The best performance for regular events at SF-7 was obtained when alarm events are allocated to SF-8, whereas the other combinations are affected for a stronger interference.},

The technological paradigm of the Internet of Things (IoT) provides the potential to enable Smart Cities, which emphasize rational consumption and waste reduction. This work proposes a system to monitor and identify leakages on Water Distribution Networks (WDNs). The monitoring devices must operate in Low-Power Wide Area Networks (LPWAN), networks that enable low power consumption at the cost of limited data throughput. A case study WDN was created on a software environment for data collection in various operation scenarios, including leakages in different locations. The obtained data sets were analyzed through data inference techniques to identify separable classes or features. Then, a Deep Learning algorithm was used to estimate the probable location of leaks in the WDN. The results obtained in the proposed case study indicate that the Deep Learning approach is a viable methodology to identify and locate leakages, despite the limited data throughput from LPWAN technologies.},

  abstract={The use of sensors for the monitoring of a given environment allied to the Internet as a means of communication is popularly known as Internet of Things (IoT). The amount of information generated in this environment has led to an unprecedented increase in data collection. One of the major challenges for its development lies in the storage and the processing of this huge volume of data into acceptable measurement and analysis parameters. This research takes up this challenge by storing and compiling data from different sensors, and by carrying out an exploratory analysis of the information gathered. In this research, sensors that collect data from a specific Sao Paulo's Metropolitan Area (SMA) have been analysed. These sensors are capable of measuring carbon monoxide (CO) levels. This research aims to analyse the main architectures for both batch and stream sensor processing and to use one of them for the construction of a Big Data environment. Big Data tools were used for IoT storage, processing and visualization data. During the experiments, carbon monoxide sensors (MQ7), were analysed. They were connected through a microcontroller unit that supports the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP). This project highlights the necessary tools to execute and analyse the data in a dynamic manner. The data collected by the sensors show that the avarage levels of carbon monoxide are well above the international standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO).},

  abstract={Applications for intelligent transportation systems are springing up to bring many benefits to users during their journey through the use of vehicle traffic monitoring. However, testing and experimenting with real-world environments still poses a challenge for these applications since a realistic scenario of mobility is required. Typically, simulation tools use mobility trails to construct the network topology based on the mathematical formulation of a city mobility model, which attempts to emulate the real mobility of a given city. Another strategy is to use the real route of vehicles traveling to generate the model of mobility of a certain city; however, many studies available in the literature do not use the entire flow of vehicles that circulate in the city, acquiring data only of a small group of vehicles. Thus, in this work we intend to develop an infrastructure that would allow the extraction of the information of mobility from the vehicles of the countryside cities, in real time. This enables not only real-time vehicle monitoring but also the generation of traceability of real-time mobility. The results showed low battery consumption, as well as a low amount of mobile data usage.},

The treated results of several measurements of EV charging characteristics provided the basis to estimate the increase in electricity demand. Deterministic and stochastic analyzes considering the influence of the distance previously traveled by the vehicle and the moment of its connection to the network were compared, allowed to obtain the diversity factor.

  pages={65974-65980},
  abstract={In Brazil, the government has historically given low attention to the planning of telecommunication infrastructure, such as the prediction of the Internet bandwidth in the short and medium term, since this process can be slow and costly. Notably, smart city applications are impaired by this policy, because they depend on cost-benefit technology to support the Internet of Things. This paper presents a method for forecasting the Internet demand based on public data obtained from the International Telecommunication Union, the World Bank, and government agencies, using Brazil as a case study. The information inputs are associated with the population growth, and with social and technological development. The prediction process uses statistic concepts and models to infer the relationship between input variables and the data bandwidth rate. The proposed methodology is not restricted to the prediction of the Internet demand and may also be used to estimate other concerns for developing countries, such as oil, energy, and water consumption. The method is compared with other time series analysis models. The results reveal that factors related to innovation and technology significantly impact the annual projection of the Internet demand.},

  year={2017},

  pages={49-54},
  abstract={Current smart city scenarios are strongly related to the use of wireless communications for providing a ubiquitous and pervasive network. The used wireless network devices are nodes with several restrictions in terms of hardware, energy, and communication. Due to these limitations, the selection of the appropriated routing protocol represents an important task in order to seek an efficient network. Although the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is used in a great variety of smart city applications, recent studies have been identifying some drawbacks and limitations of this protocol. In this context, the Lightweight On-demand Ad hoc Distance-vector Routing Protocol (LOADng) can emerge as an important alternative to RPL. The LOADng is a reactive routing protocol continuously used and evaluated in various network scenarios, but its performance in a smart city network was not studied yet. Hence, this work presents a performance evaluation study considering the use of LOADng in a smart city scenario. The routing protocol was evaluated using different routing metrics aiming to define the most appropriated one for a smart city application. The LOADng and the various routing metrics described in the paper were evaluated considering the packet delivery ratio, latency, number of hops, spent energy per bit, and network energy consumption. The results express that LOADng can present an efficient performance in applications with constant periodical data messages, but it is decreased when the messages are sent sporadically.},

  year={2023},

  pages={1-7},
  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT), like other network infrastructures, requires Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) to be protected against attacks. When deploying an IDS in IoT-based smart city environments, the balance between latency and node capacity must be considered, which justifies a distributed IDS with specific classifiers based on the location of the system processing nodes. This paper proposes a two-level classification technique for collaborative anomaly-based IDSs deployed on fog and edge nodes. A Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) is used in the lower layer classifier at the edge, while a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used in the upper layer classifier at the fog. Experimentation has demonstrated that the suggested IDS architecture outperforms previous solutions. For instance, in some scenarios, when comparing our proposal with Random Forest, the former obtained an accuracy equal to 99.1%, while the latter obtained 95.3%. Furthermore, our proposal can better select the most important network traffic features, reducing 76% of the data to be analyzed and improving privacy.},

License plate extraction is performed by a cascade of Haar-like features classifiers, built using the AdaBoost algorithm. Filters based on mathematical morphology prepare candidate plates for binarization and a simple threshold rule segments them.

  abstract={This paper describes an ongoing development of an Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS), with embedded Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) for visual inspection of power lines over urban regions. The development considers the concept of Drone as a Service Tool, together with the Smart Cities, relating all equipment as an Internet of Things (IoT) device, bringing to the urban scenario the aerial mobility and the A.I procedures, to increase the process effectiveness and reducing costs of the orthodoxy power lines inspection process, with the use of new technologies. The application development was made considering the operational requests of the Brazilian National Agency of Electric Energy, that is, considering the automatization activity at the maintenance process on the field an improvement. In this case, the Aerial platform, is represented by a quadcopter with embedded computer running A.I. procedures and computer vision, to control and to do the visual inspection, according to the mission requirements. The integration of each sensor and data processing are done inside of UAS, using specific embedded computer and boards, defined as payload control board, to processing data onboard and reduce the telemetry throughput, as sample, the imagery control, image processing and pattern recognition, navigation avoid obstacle, and to control the Drone in automatic or remotely piloted mode, giving some “intelligence” for the squadron operation (swarm), using the technic of area saturation to inspect all local infrastructure. The main characteristic of our application is the management data and the visual process. In this scope the aerial platform has embedded a set of cameras able to collect the image of the electrical asset, e.g., power line poles, lightning rod, rust/corrosion, damaged bolts and others, using thermal or regular cameras. The power line inspection process considers the Drone scanning the field, to identify the targets, doing the pattern recognition and other automatic procedures according to each operational scope and I.A. procedures, in order to increase the power lines maintenance process effectiveness. The Aerial systems are constantly monitored in real time by a set of Command and Control Stations (CCS), with dedicated infrastructure and software, from the field at the Situation room. This development is compounded by the management software (SIGI), UAS and specific IoT devices, totally integrated with the CCS room. Based on the data collected from the interest areas, SIGI software has the ability to show real time situational analysis, guiding the manager at resources optimization (material and human) improving the efficiency of resource allocation in these areas, reducing process costs and improving the maintenance management process improving the Brazilian energy services.},

  abstract={In recent years, the technological resources of the Digital Era have been employed to improve sustainability, especially in the cities. As the global population increases and moves to urban areas, there is a growing need for utilities such as water, electricity, gas, and others. The current Smart City concept is strongly tied to Information and Communication Technology (ICT) towards improving sustainability and ensuring efficient usage of scarce resources in the urban area. This paper intends to evaluate Graph Neural Networks (GNN), a class of graph-based Deep Learning algorithms, to detect and locate water leakage under the data availability restrictions of Low Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWAN), a popular class of wireless sensor networks in IoT/Smart Cities applications. A case study Water Distribution Network (WDN) was developed to obtain data for training and validation. Also, linear regression was employed to minimize the number of sensor nodes, aiming to reduce implementation costs. The results indicate that the graph-based approach tied with linear regression in intermediate nodes can provide up to 80% accuracy, even under the data restrictions of LPWAN. Also, the usage of linear regression improved the mean accuracy of the GNN algorithm by approximately 18% in all three simulated cases in comparison to the situation without data from intermediate (junction) nodes, even with 37% fewer sensor nodes available.},

If UAVs are required, they will be moved to these areas of greatest demand; otherwise, the UAVs will remain at the base station.

The concept of Smart City can be used to mitigate several of the challenges arising from the aforementioned issues, relying on multiple tools and techniques (such as crowdsensing) to gather essential context data about how actual citizens consume resources and commute throughout their everyday lives. In this paper, we show how an urban mobility data analytics tool may help to determine the most visited regions and interconnections in an urban area. This information has been obtained using data gathered from a pool of users participating in a crowdsensing campaign, using the ParticipAct Brazil platform. The obtained results confirm the reliability of the information produced, highlighting the regions with the highest concentration of people during the geolocation monitoring process and their connections; therefore, this data may be used to plan possible future changes to how the city allocates its resources, to better suit the mobility needs of its citizens.},

  abstract={This paper proposes the adoption of a more pragmatic approach to urban sensing to leverage the initial offering of open databases within the context of smart cities. In this sense, the use of mobility agents already available to provide mobility to traditional sensors can enable a preliminary instrumentation of cities more quickly and possibly at a lower cost. As proof of concept, we investigated the use of metropolitan bus equipped with sensors such as urban data collectors. We believe that this strategy can help overcoming many challenges of traditional approaches for instrumentation of cities, such as power supply, maintenance, operation, and protection of a large amount of static sensors. To assess the feasibility of sampling by collectors, we conducted experiments comparing averages using frequent readings vs averages using intermittent readings collected by sensors of a climatological micro station.},

  abstract={The growth in the number of connected vehicles in ad-hoc networks or VANETs enables the use of increasingly sophisticated services and applications. One emerging application in this scenario is Platooning, a stable stream of connected autonomous vehicles. This application improves safety, vehicle flow on the road, energy consumption, among other variables. However, vehicles using this technology need to share space with vehicles not connected or with other automation levels. Among the bottlenecks in scenarios like this, Platoons formation and splits stand out, as these maneuvers involve costs and risk. Therefore, our contribution is developing a new strategy for Platoons formation in a mixed universe of vehicles to bring some of these desired benefits. The results show that the proposed solution achieved an accuracy of 89% of the entire amount of platoons in the datasets. Our experiments demonstrate cases with collisions, and the proposed solution provides a solution to a more safe operation on roads. Finally, we conclude that our solution provides more determinism in the traffic conditions, as vehicles achieving stationary speeds with low variation.},

  abstract={Edge computing takes computation away from the Cloud closer to the physical world. Therefore, it reduces the cost of communication bandwidth between IoT devices and the Cloud. However, Edge computing imposes certain limitations in computation power because due to poor hardware capacity of the devices. This restriction may significantly affect the performance of the deployed applications, especially Smart City applications. This limitations also could be aggravated by unpredictable human behaviors wich will easily make the Edge computation node overloaded. Osmotic computing is a new IoT application programming paradigm that provides an opportunity to balance the workload between Edge and Cloud therefore to overcome the load imbalance problem of Smart City applications. To this end, we propose an Osmotic Execution Framework that leverages state-of-the-art microservices techniques to deploy and execute a Smart City application in a distributed environment including Edge and Cloud. Finally, we evaluate load balancing through latency time analysis of our framework with a real-world smart parking application.},

  abstract={The maintenance of the quality of the public transport service in big cities requires constant monitoring, which may become an expensive and time-consuming practice. The perception of quality, from the users point of view is an important aspect of quality monitoring. In this sense, we proposed a methodology based on big data analysis and visualization, which allows for the structuring of estimates and assumptions of where and who seems to be having unsatisfactory experiences while making use of the public transportation in metropolitan areas. Moreover, it provides support in setting up a plan for on-site quality surveys. The proposed methodology increases the likelihood that, with the on-site visits, the interviewer finds users who suffer inconveniences, which influence their behavior. Simulation comparison and a small-scale pilot survey helped validate the proposed method.},

  abstract={The constant increase in the number of vehicles, the lack of road traffic management and the technological limitations of traffic light control devices, contribute to increasing congestion, environmental and noise pollution. The applications involving the Internet of Things (IoT) concept have been growing around the world. Concerning the problems found in cities with large populations, the IoT applications aim technological solutions that improve the population living conditions. Most traffic light controller systems are locally programmed. In this case, to control all traffic lights in a city, besides to be a slow task, it is not possible to determine the traffic light's operating state. In some cases a centralized control is used, allowing information exchange with all traffic lights on the network. This paper seeks to study and develop a traffic light controller electronic circuit, with centralized control topology, able to communicate with other wireless network traffic lights. All characteristics of the designed circuit were evaluated by practical system control and monitoring tests. Finally, the electronic circuit proved to be viable in terms of smart cities applications.},

  year={2017},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={In apartments, houses and hotels, showers are by far the biggest consumers of water, responding to about 25% of the total volume consumed every month. When winter hits big cities and temperatures fall, the hot water consumption increases dramatically. Since end users often dispense cold water present in the pipelines until the heated water from the reservoirs is perceived in showers or other points of use, hotels and residential buildings are responsible for a considerable waste of treated water. Several solutions based on local hardware have been proposed to partially overcome this problem, but many of them try to reduce the waste of water at the expense of reducing the efficiency of the heating and recirculating systems. The age of the IoT has brought to the smart buildings new perspectives regarding to rational use of resources, providing savings and real comfort for users. This work proposes a smart water heating scheme, mediated by IoT technology, for large buildings in urban settings. The main goal is ensuring the minimal waste of water as well as energy economy in pumping and heating systems. The proposed automated solution is built from an open-source Asterisk-based IP-PBX on cloud computing technology. A complete experimental setup considering a residential building in the southeastern region of Brazil is implemented and tested. The achieved benefits are tangible and significant when compared to the dedicated existing systems.},

However, many issues still remain when concerning the proper assembling of the available components, specially when scalability and flexible programming characteristics are sought. Additionally, for a considerable group of applications, monitoring units may be attached to mobile elements, which may incur in connectivity interruptions. In this context, this work proposes a general hardware architecture to support the development of offline multi-sensor monitoring units, defining a reference operation that can be easily adapted to any application. Moreover, a prototype of a monitoring unit for bicycles is defined, indicating the hardware components that have to be used for eventual physical production. Since mobile-centric monitoring may become an important trend in smart cities, the provided definitions can significantly contribute to the development of efficient, flexible and affordable monitoring units.},

  abstract={Multi-step ahead time series forecasting is essential in Internet of Things (IoT) applications in smart cities and smart homes to make accurate future predictions and precise decision-making. Thus, this study introduces a novel multiple-input single-output (MISO) forecasting method called Multi-Step Embedding-based Fuzzy Time Series (MS-EFTS), designed to predict high-dimensional non-stationary time series data. As a first-order approach, it employs a direct strategy that integrates an embedding transformation with a weighted multivariate FTS (WMVFTS) model. This combination allows for effective predictions over long-term horizons within low-dimensional, learned continuous representations. The effectiveness of the proposed MS-EFTS is assessed using three high-dimensional IoT time series in this investigation. The obtained results showcase the superior performance of the proposed method compared to some deep learning forecasting methods, including LSTM, BiLSTM, TCN, and CNN-LSTM, in terms of accuracy, parsimony, and efficiency.},

  abstract={In Internet of Things (IoT) applications, data flows are continuous streams of high-dimensional time series that aggregate various data sources. In this context, decision-making processes frequently encompass multiple factors and criteria that demand forecasting these time series. This paper introduces MO-WMVFTS, a novel multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) fuzzy time series (FTS) method for tackling this complex scenario. MO-WMVFTS is a hybrid forecasting method that fuses weighted multivariate FTS (WMVFTS) with embedding transformations, designed for IoT applications. To assess the performance of the proposed method, it was applied to the prediction of energy consumption in smart homes and air quality in smart cities. Here, three real-world datasets are used to assess the validity of our proposed approach, and the results obtained are highly competitive when compared to other existing methods.},

  abstract={The comfort on school buses has not had a concern on the policymakers and authorities, considering that the student who lives far from his home spends a considerable amount of time inside a bus. The time spent in the round trip to the school, and other kinematic parameters, mainly the acceleration and vibration, could affect student productivity at school, even time spent in the home with relatives. Improving this service could be an excellent strategy to ensure the well-being of the student.

  abstract={A large number of vehicles routinely navigate through city streets; with on-board sensors, they can be transformed into a dynamic network that monitors the urban environment comprehensively and efficiently. In this paper, drive-by approaches are discussed as a form of mobile sensing, that offer a number of advantages over more traditional sensing approaches. It is shown that the physical properties of the urban environment that can be captured using drive-by sensing include ambient fluid, electromagnetic, urban envelope, photonic, and acoustic properties, which comprise the FEELS classification. In addition, the spatiotemporal variations of these phenomena are discussed as well as their implications on discrete-time sampling. The mobility patterns of sensor-hosting vehicles play a major role in drive-by sensing. Vehicles with scheduled trajectories, e.g., buses, and those with less predictable mobility patterns, e.g., taxis, are investigated for sensing efficacy in terms of spatial and temporal coverage. City Scanner is a drive-by approach with a modular sensing architecture, which enables cost-effective mass data acquisition on a multitude of city features. The City Scanner framework follows a centralized IoT regime to generate a near real-time visualization of sensed data. The sensing platform was mounted on top of garbage trucks and collected drive-by data for eight months in Cambridge, MA, USA. Acquired data were streamed to the cloud for processing and subsequent analyses. Based on a real-world application, we discuss and show the potential of using drive-by approaches to collect environmental data in urban areas using a variety of nondedicated land vehicles to optimize data collection in terms of spatiotemporal coverage.},

Real-time performance, security, resource allocation and network convergence are only few of the issues to be tackled in order to provide proper and flexible Experimentation as a Service (EaaS) facilities in city-scale infrastructures. Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualisation (NFV) appear as important enablers for providing such largescale testbeds, while promoting them as completely open programmable infrastructures. In this paper, we take the position of emerging applications or services designers/programmers that have stringent network requirements and want to know how to benefit from EaaS provided by open programmable (city-scale) infrastructures.

By means of the frequency inverter, it is possible to reduce the motor rotation, when a set pressure is close to the expected value, preventing the motor from turning off and as the pressure decreases, the frequency inverter increases the motor rotation. If, for some reason, the process unstable, the redundancy system will shut off the engine. In addition, the implementation, in addition to raising the average supply pressure, ensured the reduction of pressure peaks, fuel consumption, number of engine units and energy costs. All this tied to a proportional integral control, concepts about Smart Cities and industrial networks.},

The Super Learner combines supervised classifiers to detect abnormal samples or determine a class of an event from spectral features extracted from original sounds. We study the impact on time processing and performance of varying the number of K-folds in the cross-validation step using the Environmental Sound Classification (ESC-50) and Malfunctioning Industrial Machine Investigation and Inspection (MIMII) datasets. The performance evaluation demonstrates that RF is the best classifier in the ESC-50 dataset and SVM in the MIMII dataset. However, the Super Learner reaches AUC and F1-Score values near the best algorithm in the majority of cases analyzed, representing the best tradeoff solution.},

  abstract={Automated license plate recognition (ALPR) technology is a powerful technology enabling more efficient and effective law enforcement, security, payment collection, and research. A common license plate standard was adopted by the member states of the Mercosur trading bloc (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) and consequently requires an upgrade to the ALPR software used by law enforcement and industry. Due to the scarcity of real license plate images, training state-of-the-art supervised detectors is unfeasible unless data augmentation techniques and synthetic training data are used. This paper presents an accurate and efficient automated Mercosur license plate detector using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained exclusively with synthetic imagery. In order to obtain the synthetic training data, Mercosur license plates were faithfully reproduced. Digital image processing techniques were employed to reduce the domain gap and a CNN with basic image manipulation was used to embed the artificial licensed plates in to realistic contexts. The trained model was then validated on real images captured from a parking lot and a publicly available traffic monitoring video stream. The results of experiments suggest detection accuracy of about 95% and an average running time of 40 milliseconds.},

  abstract={This article discusses the main problems of traditional cemeteries in urban centers, including the lack of space due to population growth, environmental contamination from the use of toxic products in burials, public health issues arising from poor management and maintenance, and cultural and religious issues that make the grieving experience more challenging. The goal is to propose a new cemetery model integrated into urban planning that minimizes environmental impacts and offers a more humane experience for families and visitors, contributing to the sustainable development of cities. Additionally, this work highlights the importance of interdisciplinary research and partnerships between government, the private sector, and academia to develop this new cemetery paradigm. The method used was an integrative review on the subject. The article first addresses the current problems of traditional cemeteries; then, it introduces concepts of smart and sustainable cities that can be applied to cemeteries; and finally, it suggests the implementation of a new model for cemeteries, including the addition of green spaces, efficient use of water resources and solar energy, artificial intelligence-based monitoring systems, as well as virtual memorials and other innovations. Certainly, this innovative model has the potential to create a more humane and sustainable environment for urban cemeteries by integrating smart technologies and meeting the cultural and emotional needs of communities.},

  abstract={The use of non-destructive technologies for the construction of underground networks has been gaining strength in recent years. Especially in metropolitan regions, the option is to have the lowest possible impact in the face of existing interferences, since these impacts generate indirect costs that are generally not very tangible, such as, for example, the social costs pertaining to them. Also, compared to trenching, non-destructive methods are shorter in duration, cause minimal interference with traffic and commerce, and in most cases, require no surface excavation. In this way, this article brings to light the benefits and advantages involved in the use of non-destructive methods in the installation of underground electricity networks, in contrast to the traditional method of “open pit”.

Based on the data collected from the interest areas, SIGI software has the ability to show real-time situational analysis of these areas and allows that the administrator can optimize resources (material and human) improving the efficiency of resource allocation in these areas. In addition to the development of the management software, the development of sensors to collect the information in the field and update these information to the database of the management software, are considered. The sensors will be recognized as IoT devices for the collection of meteorological data, images and command / control Drones. Initially the system will be customized, using an Artificial Intelligence tool, to collect data and identify the outbreaks of the dengue mosquito, zika and Chikungunya, nominee by risk areas. After the definition of the potential risk areas, in a complementary way, a totally customized Drone will be used to map these areas of interest, generating aerial photographs, identifying and geotagging the potential “targets”, which will allow the agents to identify potential mosquito breeding sites. After the identification of breeding areas, the next step will be the effective combat of the vectors, using the Drones to fly over the areas of interest, where biological defenses will be “dropped” over the targets to combat mosquitoes. Due some Drone flight restrictions over the cities, the whole process will be monitored by a situation room, that will be able to control the Drone remotely, access the air space controller, reads the sensors installed in the city (field), that will measure, for example, rainfall through weather stations installed in risk areas and subsequently processed by Intelligent System Integrated Management (SIGI), which will result to the information public official reflecting the situational analysis of the areas, which will enable a better management of available resources, helping the public agent, preventively in the decision making.},

  abstract={New sensors and devices are being incorporated in modern buildings and cities to facilitate the understanding of its dynamics and improve its efficiency. With this in mind, the combination of information technology and sensors capable of capturing and sharing energy data with other devices can help solve power consumption problems. However, large volumes of these data are collected and stored uninterrupted, becoming a challenge to analyze it to confirm trends, identify hidden patterns, and outliers to aid in decision-making. As an alternative to address the issue, this paper presents an interactive visual analytics system to understand energy data coming from a smart building or city. This system provides ways to analyze the data at different levels of time granularities for the identification of energy trends, patterns, and data outliers. Moreover, it combines different algorithms that allow fulfilling predictive analysis. An analysis with domain experts demonstrates the feasibility and advantages of using the system to monitor energy data.},

  pages={1-4},
  abstract={Large cities are paying a lot of attention to the dramatic challenges resulted from increasing air pollution and the global warming, struggling to find new promising solutions to face them. As a result, alternative transportation in urban areas has been sought, trying to reduce urban pollution while also addressing mobility issues in crowded cities. Actually, although bikes have been considered as a promising resource for more efficient and cleaner urban mobility, there are several concerns that must be considered when using bike paths already implemented in urban areas. In fact, some environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, noise pollution, ultraviolet radiation and light intensity can bring several problems to the health of cyclists who are constantly exposed to them, thus requiring constant and historical analysis of these conditions. In this context, this paper proposes an environmental monitoring system based on low-cost mobile sensors-based devices attached to bikes, which allow the identification of the most recommended areas for cycling in relation to possible damage to the health of cyclists. For that, the electronic components chosen for the construction of those devices must be highly accessible and affordable, supporting large-scale development. Additionally, the proposed approach is based on a hybrid communication model that does not require any urban communication infrastructure, easing its practical exploitation. The proposed approach seeks then to provide better support to governments when assessing the conditions of the currently installed bike paths and also when planning the implementation of new paths, potentially bringing important contributions to the management of modern cities.},

  abstract={Vehicle-based sensing is a valuable paradigm to serve third-party applications, but understanding the coverage of such networks is not trivial. For urban buses, trajectories are spatially predictable, but traffic conditions can hinder data timeliness. In this letter, we propose a metric to quantify the contribution of individual buses to the coverage of different applications. We apply this metric to bus mobility traces from Rio de Janeiro for applications of waste management, air quality, and noise monitoring, ranking buses accordingly. We show that bus contribution is strongly related to the application - 23% of buses change more than 2,000 places in different application rankings.},

  abstract={With the emergence of smartphones and location-based social networks, a large amount of user-generated data has become available to better understand city dynamics and help urban planning. While most of the related works choose to focus on specific dimensions of the data, the proposed models aim to benefit from the extent of the information existing in social platforms. Thus, this paper explores the full potential of social media data and proposes novel clustering models for retrieving information about city dynamics and urban characterization by incorporating new dimensions to state of the art algorithms. Aspects such as venue rating, entropy and popularity may lead to new and more complete understanding of activities and trends in a city. Preliminary experiments show that it is possible to aggregate a large diversity of information from different social networks, and generate different and complementary visualizations of the city. Moreover, by applying these methods to urban environments, governments and citizens can better understand and build better sustainable cities together.},

  abstract={Electrical energy is among the most important resources used nowadays, in the modern world. Despite this, there is a considerable waste of much of what is spent on power generation, since some of the energy generated does not reach the final consumer. One of the scopes addressed by smart cities is the optimal use of the basic resources available to the population, such as electricity. Thermographic inspection is a technique that allows non-invasive sensing. Through it, it is possible to analyze components and electrical equipment by capturing the temperature of its surface. With the aim of finding electrical faults and reducing losses, this work studies the use of thermography, computational algorithms and artificial intelligence techniques to automatically detect electrical problems.},

  title={Using Deep Neural Networks to Quantify Parking Dwell Time}, 
  year={2024},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1504-1509},
  abstract={In smart cities, it is common practice to define a maximum length of stay for a given parking space to increase the space's rotativity and discourage the usage of individual transportation solutions. However, automatically determining individual car dwell times from images faces challenges, such as images collected from low-resolution cameras, lighting variations, and weather effects. In this work, we propose a method that combines two deep neural networks to compute the dwell time of each car in a parking lot. The proposed method first defines the parking space status between occupied and empty using a deep classification network. Then, it uses a Siamese network to check if the parked car is the same as the previous image. Using an experimental protocol that focuses on a cross-dataset scenario, we show that if a perfect classifier is used, the proposed system generates 75% of perfect dwell time predictions, where the predicted value matched exactly the time the car stayed parked. Nevertheless, our experiments show a drop in prediction quality when a real-world classifier is used to predict the parking space statuses, reaching 49% of perfect predictions, showing that the proposed Siamese network is promising but impacted by the quality of the classifier used at the beginning of the pipeline.},

  abstract={Motivated by Smart City applications and services, this article presents a novel approach to identifying user communities in communication networks. We define user communities as groups of users that share common mobility features over spatio-temporal scales of arbitrary length, such as time spent in certain locales, mobility speed, and time between consecutive movements. We describe our user community identification framework in detail including how mobility features can be extracted from real mobility traces (as examples of unlabelled data) and synthetic mobility records (as examples of labeled data). We present results obtained when using our approach in four distinct mobility scenarios represented by both unlabeled and labeled datasets. We also introduce a new validation methodology that uses image-based similarity metrics in order to assess the quality of identified communities. Our results show that the proposed approach significantly increases similarity between users within the same community as well as dissimilarity between users in different communities. We also demonstrate that the proposed user community identification approach yields significant increase in contact time amongst users belonging to the same community when compared to the average contact time when not considering community structures.},

We train an embedded Deep Neural Network model able to identify potentially dangerous events like car accidents or emergency vehicles approaching from recorded sounds. We evaluate our model on a large novel dataset of sounds recorded inside the car cabin with audio data augmentation techniques applied thereon.

  abstract={─Smart City is one area of application for the Internet of Things (IoT) and it has been attracting attention from both academia and industry. Cities will be composed by autonomous parts that communicate and provide services to each other. For instance, cars (autonomous or not) may be seen as a service that transports people from one point to another. Interactions between users and these kinds of services will grow, making it necessary to have digitization of all these parts of the Smart City. The Digital Twin (DT) concept proposes that real-world assets have a virtual representation connecting the physical world with the cyber world. This allows to track the whole life-cycle of this object as well as perform simulations with current or previously stored data. In this context, this work proposes the use of Digital Twin for enabling and supporting car-as-a-service (CaaS). A case study has been developed to demonstrate the modeling and the deployment of the Digital Twin, highlighting how this concept can be one of the key enablers for CaaS.},

  pages={91-97},
  abstract={Long-Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) networks are a promising solution for Internet of Things (IoT) applications that require low power consumption and long-range coverage. These wireless networks enable data transmission between IoT devices and gateways, which are responsible for capturing and relaying messages to a server. However, LoRaWAN network planning involves complex issues, such as determining the number and positioning of gateways, which can impact data transmission efficiency. In this context, this work introduces LoRaWAN IoT Simulation and Optimization Environment Planning (LoRaWISEP) - a Software as a Service (SaaS) designed to assist LoRaWAN network planning through simulations that enable the quantification and positioning of gateways. LoRaWISEP is characterized as a Decision Support tool, aiding in the design of LoRaWAN network infrastructure. The system is developed based on Design Thinking, encompassing stages of immersion, ideation, prototyping, and development to ensure the software meets user needs and offers suitable usability. The study is characterized as a descriptive and qualitative approach. Consequently, the proposed tool can assist in LoRaWAN network planning with an interface that allows easy configuration of parameters, such as the selection of quantification and gateway positioning algorithms. Additionally, the system provides performance results, such as Packet Delivery Rate (PDR), which can be used to evaluate network performance. Therefore, LoRaWISEP facilitates LoRaWAN network planning, significantly contributing to the allocation of IoT devices in various scenarios, including smart cities and precision agriculture, which benefits the scientific community and professionals working with LoRaWAN.},

  abstract={Smart city is a concept and a strategy used to address problems derived from rapid urbanization. Initially focused on the smart use of information and communication technology, the concept has broadened its horizons and is now seen as straightly connected to the concept of sustainable development. The dissemination of green energies sources, such as wind power, is connected to the premises of sustainability and has found fertile winds in Brazil, particularly in small and poorer cities. This paper aims to analyze if the expansion of wind energy is being capable of pushing these small cities into a sustainable development path and, thus, to become smarter cities. A review of the literature provides the key features to analyze these cities. The main conclusion is that despite of a huge increase in tax revenue, there is an erratic movement in the cities, revealing that improvements in one area are not necessarily associated to better performance in others.},

  abstract={Cities around the world need to use advanced technology and foster innovation to provide better services to their citizens. One of the most evolving technological developments in recent years for analyzing the vast amount of information generated by billions of texts published by citizens in the Internet is Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially when used for text categorization, sentiment analysis and topic extraction. With the advent of NLP techniques, Artificial Intelligence has become applicable in different areas of science, business, and government. Although there have been advances in the application of Artificial Intelligence methods in societal problems, there is a strong lack of technologies for urban ser-vices management. This paper presents Daoura, a data intelligence platform for smart city management that transforms publications of citizens on the Internet into relevant insights, and its case on forecasting 2020 Chilean national plebiscite results for a new constitution, based on analyzing millions of citizens interactions in social media. The platform's projections reported an accuracy of 95.8% when compared to the final results, showing the importance of digital manifestations on understanding people's opinions and experiences in the society. We also discuss the significative impacts Daoura NLP skills can have on modernizing public management and creating environments that promote well-being and quality of life in cities.},

  abstract={In the broader context of smart cities, to ensure mobility of people regardless of their physical or sensory condition becomes a complex and difficult challenge to be treated. All papers referenced in this work are presented as a solution to equip the blind people with devices and sensors (controlled by a computational system) with the ability to capture environmental structure data and somehow describe it to the understanding of the blind people. Our work explores another side of this problem: how the environment can transmit data about itself to safely-help guide blind orientation in this environment? In other words, from our view, the environment must report data on its structure as opposed to make the blind person try to extract these data from this environment. So, here we propose to use an intelligent semaphore system (traffic lights) to communicate with a mobile system carried by the blind person and by the coherent processing of the signals sent and received between the mobile device and the intelligent semaphore, to conduct the blind in the streets crossing the crosswalk safely.},

  abstract={Latest generations of streetlights have been designed to support and integrate a number of features conducive to Smart Cities. LED streetlights now contain sensors, controls, wireless transmitters and microprocessors. These streetlights are gaining popularity and being deployed in large scale, eventually replacing all lighting throughout a city. The general conception is that electronic loads are harmonic sources, which can disturb the operation and supply of an electric utility. It is important for utilities to understand the true impact of this conversion program on the Power Quality. This paper studies the harmonic characteristics of LED streetlights on both individual and collective scales. On an individual level, the harmonic signature of several types of modern LED streetlights are collected and reported. On a collective level, a real case study of a large-scale deployment is studied. Real measurement data were collected during the streetlight conversion program in the city of Fort McMurray to analyze the impact on background harmonic voltage distortion. Results have shown it is unlikely LED streetlights will affect significantly the network voltage and current distortions.},

  abstract={Cities are not identical and evolve over time, and sensing in large scale can be used to capture these differences. Research in Wireless Sensor Networks has provided several tools, techniques and algorithms to solve the problem of sensing in restricted scenarios (e.g., factory). However, sensing large scale areas, such as big cities, brings many challenges and incurs high costs related to system building and management. Thus, sensing those areas becomes more feasible when people collaborate among themselves using their portable devices, and building what has been named participatory sensing systems. This work analyzes an emerging type of network derived from this type of system, the Participatory Sensor Network (PSN), where nodes are autonomous mobile entities and the sensing depends on whether they want to participate in the sensing process. Based on four datasets of participatory sensing systems (27 million of records), we show that this type of network brings many challenges related to structural problems, e.g. instant coverage very limited, and also because of big data issues, which may restrict the use of this emerging type of network. However, it presents also, as shown here, many advantages and open opportunities, mainly related to large scale study of cities dynamics.},

  abstract={Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) have provided new technologies to protect human life, speed up assistance, and improve traffic, to aid drivers, passengers, and pedestrians. Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANET) are the fundamental elements in an ITS ecosystem. However, its characteristics make the system susceptible to numerous attacks, such as Denial of Service (DoS). In this paper, we proposed a security system based on intrusion detection called Detection of Anomalous Behaviour in Smart Conveyance Operations (DAMASCO). We used a statistical approach to detect anomalies in vehicle-to-vehicle communication (V2V). The anomaly detection module addresses the Medium Access Control (MAC) sublayer to assess the number of packages sent to identify potentially malicious nodes, block their activity, and maintain a reputation list. The algorithm calculates the Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) to identify outliers and characteristics of DoS. Our experiments were performed in a simulated environment using a realistic urban mobility model. The results demonstrate that the proposed security system achieved a 3% false positive rate and no false negatives.},

  abstract={The development of smart cities requires a broad digital network, technology infrastructure, services, creativity and innovation. These are all important components of an ecosystem that offers a better quality of life to society. However, to develop systems to be part of the smart city, it is necessary to understand the challenges and opportunities involved on it, especially the informal systems that are used by citizens and do not belong to the formal structure of public administration. Informal systems are created to meet the needs of citizens. As such, this work aims to present challenges and opportunities identified in this scenario. The method adopted to increase information on this topic was an online survey research. As a result, “transport” was highlighted as the most cited opportunity and “lack of investment” as the most cited challenge to be overcome according to the participants. As a contribution, a discussion about the results is carried out and allows the analysis of the identified opportunities and challenges so that professionals can take advantage and develop systems that citizens recognize as necessary to make a smart city.},

It is part of a new maturity model of smart cities that takes into account the characteristics of its countries and its smart city indicators in order to improve the quality of life in cities. The present methodology can be applied to all the countries in the world. The maturity model is based on a well-known smart city model, the International Telecommunication Union, ITU, model, adapted and expanded. Several indicators of the model are in line with the Millennium Development Goals. To understand all the technology involved and necessary for smart cities, it is extremely necessary to know the countries and their cities well to understand the need for the development and application of new technologies. For this reason, data from Brazil, which is an emerging, south global country, was included and analyzed as a case study, in order to know the diagnose of the cities and improve the quality of life of its citizens.},

  abstract={A publish-subscribe middleware is an application-independent infrastructure that supports implementing event-based systems, in which event generators (i. e., publishers) notify events to the infrastructure and event consumers (i. e., subscribers) subscribe to the infrastructure for receiving relevant notifications. Subscribers are not directly addressable by the publisher but are indirectly addressed according to the content of the events. This anonymity ensures that publishers and subscribers exchange information without knowing each other, which allows middleware to expand to a massive size on the scale of the Internet and Smart Cities. In this way, this article presents a study on publish-subscribe middlewares for the selective sending of events in Smart Cities. This selective notification delivery is important for some applications such as emergency services in Smart Cities, where only a subset of subscribers should receive the event and handle it as soon as possible.},

  abstract={Com o advento da Indústria 5.0 o setor elétrico foi contemplado com dispositivos inteligentes que impulsionam uma elevada penetração da microgeração de energia distribuída impondo novos desafios ao setor. Este novo ambiente exige uma rede mais inteligente que inclui a transformação do simples cliente de energia elétrica em um “Cliente Inteligente” que preza pela qualidade da energia e pelo seu uso consciente. A REI “Rede Elétrica Distribuída” foi a resposta que o setor desenvolveu para atender estas exigências. Entender o consumo energético é indispensável para garantir a qualidade de serviço e atender a necessidade de segurança de dados. A utilização de simulações do comportamento de infraestruturas muito complexas é uma estratégia que tem sido bastante difundida por superar as limitações das soluções analíticas tradicionais. Este artigo apresenta a estrutura laboratorial de TICs (Tecnologias da Informação e Comunicação) desenvolvida no âmbito do Departamento de Engenharia Elétrica da Escola Politécnica da Universidade de São Paulo, com objetivo de aplicar uma arquitetura baseada na tecnologia sem fio LTE/EPC (4G, 5G e B5G) para permitir a comunicação mMTC entre os elementos de REI usando os recursos de Computação de Borda (MEC) e plataformas para cidades inteligentes. A avaliação desta proposta é realizada por meio de simulações utilizando dados adquiridos a partir de equipamentos reais e/ou emulados e de cossimulações, compartilhados pelos laboratórios de REI da POLI-USP. Finalmente, apresenta-se os resultados preliminares da integração dos laboratórios para validação e teste da arquitetura.},

  abstract={Event Notification Services (ENS) have an important role in the current context of Smart Cities. The publish-subscribe paradigm is a suitable approach to connect users and service providers. For many private and public services, including transport and emergency services, only some subscribers should receive event notifications. This paper proposes and investigates the performance of a new ENS framework which allows the sending of events to a subset of subscribers with the best conditions to handle it. The event model implemented by the ENS framework is derived from the publish-subscribe approach. It allows the best subscribers to receive the event based on a specific fitness function. An application of the ENS to the transport service is presented. The results show that when the best subscribers are chosen according to a specific desired metric, the travel time can be reduced or the best drivers can be selected. Therefore, this strategy can improve passengers' experience and optimize service performance.},

  abstract={As a result of rural and suburban migration to the cities, urban life has become a significant challenge for citizens and mayors, imposing a huge concern in the sustainable use of resources like energy, water, transportation and housing. Smart cities are the biggest bet to address these challenges efficiently through a real-time monitoring approach which aims to assist in intelligent planning and sustainable urban development. However, to accomplish this monitoring efficiently and to enable the sustainable use of resources, it is necessary an integration between citizens, city devices and the platform where the data is stored and processed. In this context, we are proposing the 3LES model (3 Levels of Energy Saving for Smart Cities), a model that combines data from citizens, city devices and nodes from the processing plataform to offer a multilevel energy saving proposal. 3LES must act transparently without affecting the quality of the services already offered in the city. This paper presents the components of management and monitoring of power consumption at various levels, as well as a model that monitors the energy consumption of elastic cloud applications. The results are promising, with a model that allows the estimation of the energy consumption of elastic applications based on CPU and memory traces with an average and median precision of 97.15% and 97.72%. In addition, we obtained a reduction of more than 90% in the energy spent in public lighting in the city of Rome when analyzing the citizens' location.},

  abstract={The smart cities concept is strongly related to energy efficiency and low carbon patterns, what that refers to meeting the sustainability criteria established by regulatory mechanisms. The Smart City Index (SCI) data can reach a higher quality of living by observing aspects as mobility, health, safety, transparency, smart management, and many others, like the waste management. Thus, this set of indicators was used to evaluate the e-waste management as an emergent challenge in urban cities, providing both, the generation of waste from the intense consumption of electronic devices, as well meeting the questions arising from urbanization from the integration of digital solutions. This study proposes a model of analysis using simple linear regression and k-mean clustering as correlation methods. The findings suggested correlation between the SCI ranking, the E-waste generated, and the economic situation of the entire set of smart cities. Nevertheless, it was found weak correlation for the best rated cities. The results provided the perception that it is possible to identify correlation from the Smart City Index and aspects from the e-waste management system, enabling the discussion over the importance of next smart city indexes and given a new perspective to the e-waste management.},

  abstract={According to the Getùlio Vargas Foundation - FGV (2015), Smart Cities are people interacting and using energy systems, materials, services and financing to catalyze economic development and improved quality of life. These interaction flows are considered smart for making strategic use of infrastructure, services, information and communication with urban planning and management to meet social and economic needs of society. According to Berrone (2016), the 10 dimensions indicate the level of intelligence of a city: governance, public administration, urban planning, technology, the environment, international connections, social cohesion, human capital and the economy. Thus, this study is proposed here address two of these topics: governance and economy. To Araúhajo (2002), the term governance as the ability of a government has to design and implement their policies this ability refers to the financial sphere, managerial and technical, while governance implies the conditions the exercise of political is based on the analysis of these dimensions that see the role of social cohesion so necessary for the construction of a structure and culture of smart cities. Once appropriating this culture, economic development will be the reflection of that interaction. According to Nakagama, cases successful in smart cities as Australia, show that generating real business results of short-term, especially as the government encouragement (tax incentives and access to credit), provides a creative economy, able to retain talents in local companies with good revenue. Thus, this paper aims to make a thematic focus on what public policy strategies that drive the construction of smart cities in order to verify the impact of public policies and this study the importance of public engagement in governance: identify talent retention strategies and analyze the socio-economic development. Thus, a descriptive and exploratory methodology grounded in case study of governance practices in Australia will be applied, these practices opposed to the Brazilian.},

  abstract={The context of smart cities has been increasingly recurrent in world literature. The present study aims to analyze the contributions of leadership, governance, and people to the development of smart cities. To achieve this objective, the methodology Methodi Ordinatio was used, and data was collected from Scopus, Science Direct, and Web of Science using the following keywords combinations: smart cities, smart governance, smart leadership, and smart people. The results of the analysis reveal the importance of people acting with intelligent practices, as well as the need to encourage leadership and governance strategies. If there is a link between these three pillars, with the intention of sustainable development aimed at the common good, the chances of institutionalizing smart cities are greater. The study's conclusions point to the need for interconnection between individuals, leaders, and governments for a city to develop intelligently, therefore, having identified the absence of a concept that encompasses the three dimensions, this article contributes to an expanded conceptualization of smart cities.},

  title={Assessing the Feasibility of Developing a White Label SD-WAN Solution for Smart Cities}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-6},
  abstract={Recently, many researchers have tried to answer a question regarding smart cities: how to connect a wide variety of sensors and aggregate the data collected by different technologies related to the Internet of Things (IoT)? Those data are usually gathered and transmitted through WAN (Wide Area Network) or private MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) connections. However, since WAN based solutions present different resources in terms of data, size, coverage area, latency and capacity requirements, they become inefficient or even prohibitive regarding operating costs on smart city applications. An alternative is the use of SD-WAN (Software-Defined Wide Area Network), which combines hardware and software appliances or is software based only, consisting of the virtualization of WAN connections. The main characteristics of SD-WAN are: the ability to do dynamic path selection, facilitating data flow and increasing system resilience; the support to multiple connection types (ADSL, VDSL, FTTH, 3G/4G or 5G), enlarging the coverage area when compared with traditional WAN; the employment of a simple interface (easy to configure and manage); the capital and operation expenditure reduction; the increase of service agility and flexibility; the implementation of a centralized control and monitoring with lower costs. In this sense, this paper proposes an SD-WAN embedded white-label solution, of low cost and low energy consumption for commercial and academic use employing Ubuntu Linux, Floodlight SDN Controller, Open vSwitch and Raspberry Pi 3b. Then, the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters obtained by the proposed SD-WAN solution are measured and evaluated, through network emulation tests performed with the aid of Distributed Internet Traffic Generator (D-ITG), in order to verify the applicability in smart cities.},

  abstract={Smart cities are cities that aim to develop the quality of life of their citizens, with the use of technology. More and more often, projects are built to give more smartness to cities. These projects involve various types of decision making by managers. These decisions may be influenced by factors such as colonialism and the sociotechnical imaginary. This research in progress seeks to answer how do the smart cities of Brazil and Colombia choose to adopt smart city solutions? This study will be developed as a multiple case study on SC initiatives in these countries. In-depth interviews will be conducted with the actors involved in the projects and the documents of the smart cities will be analyzed. By achieving the objectives expected by this research, it is intended to encourage the adoption of assertive solutions and provoke reflection on the choice of best practices for the SCs.},

  abstract={In recent years, some research and development (R&D) companies in the energy area have been developed by the Federal University of Pará (UFPA) within the University City Campus Professor José Silveira Netto. These projects have included elements of a Smart City on the Campus. However, there is still no survey to identify which indicators of a smart city are already present on the Campus and how smart it is. Therefore, this article will present the application of the Brazilian Standard ABNT NBR ISO 37122: 2020 of Smart Cities Indicators at the UFPA Headquarters Campus, with the objective of verifying which Smart City indicators are already present on the Campus due to the development of an electric mobility R&D. In addition to being the first time this standard has been applied on Campus, this work is also the first to carry out such a survey. As a result, a checklist was generated, where it was possible to count 4 categories and 17 indicators present within the Campus. Thus, demonstrating that UFPA is starting its process of insertion in the concept of Smart Cities.},

  abstract={Tree fall is a major issue in large cities as it may obstruct roads and lead to traffic jams, and even injure people. Following these kind of incidents, monitoring the environment through sensors and Internet of Things technologies emerges as an important preventive approach. Another point is that the net primary productivity has a sensitive relation with trees characteristics including plant respiration and net photosynthesis which are highly sensitive to temperature. The health of the tree can then be monitored through leaf transpiration, sap flow measurement, environment evaluation as these methods offer indicators on any chance of a fall. The solution proposed in this paper includes an open-design hardware setup for monitoring trees in Smart Cities with Internet of Things. The setup is connected to a Smart City platform aiming to facilitate the use by other researchers and botanics, specially. Therefore, we noticed that the daily sensing data results in a huge amount of information that requires a balance between Big Data and Edge Computing approaches to process the whole collected data. The evaluation of the sensing data is presented together with the proposed architecture.},

Technologies based on renewable sources for power generation, such as solar and wind, have emerged as an alternative for these sectors. With the development of distributed generation technologies, such as photovoltaic cells, wind turbines, and so on, it is necessary to identify and classify the disturbances that embedded electronic systems in these technologies may cause on distributed grids. This paper presents some data collected and analyzed on the Smart City Búzios project, where were installed three small wind turbines and solar photovoltaic systems in different grid points. This work presents and discusses some data collected on these systems regarding harmonic analysis. In the remaining of this paper is discussed data related to: vertical wind turbines, photovoltaic system for charging electric vehicles, photovoltaic system feeding computerized command center and photovoltaic system powering LED lamps in public area.},

  abstract={Smart city platforms support application development and deployment and typically rely on a robust, scalable underlying Information Technology infrastructure composed of cloud platforms, containers, virtual machines, storage, and other services. Such a runtime infrastructure must deal with the highly dynamic workload of the different applications, with simultaneous access from multiple users and sometimes working with many interconnected devices and systems. This scenario requires auto-scaling mechanisms that automatically and timely add or remove cloud resources in response to dynamic variations in workload. This paper introduces a decision-making mechanism that analyzes the monitored state of a smart city platform and its underlying infrastructure at runtime to decide whether auto-scaling is needed. The performance of the decision-making mechanism has been evaluated upon the computational environment that supports a platform for developing real-world smart city applications.},

  abstract={Large volumes of data from various sources are generated continuously in cities. The processing and analysis of these data play a key role in the implementation of initiatives for smart cities. In order to process urban Big Data, it is essential to use high-performance tools to accelerate processing and provide quick answers. However, this use is not trivial because Big Data tools are not interoperable and require from their users knowledge of parallel and distributed computing and databases. In this work, we compare popular open-source Big Data processing frameworks and propose a software system to abstract and facilitate their use in smart city applications. The architecture of the system is composed by an interface to specify dataflow models as well as services to interpret these models and instantiate them in different Big Data tools. An implementation of the system on top of a smart city platform is also addressed.},

  abstract={Making cities smarter is usually achieved through Information and Communication Technology (ICT)-intensive solutions, which can be employed to collect and analyze large amounts of information generated by several sources, such as sensor networks, traffic systems, and citizens' devices. However, integrating different technologies and information to build smart city applications and services remain a challenge as different sources of heterogeneous data need to be considered. These data can be also enriched with geospatial information, thereby generating cross-sector value-added information while contributing to better planning actions in the urban space. In this context, we introduce a data integration approach upon Smart Geo Layers, a geospatial-based data middleware aimed to unify data provided by several sources in smart city environments. Along with geo-graphical information regarding the city physical space, Smart Geo Layers provides aggregation, visualization, and data analysis functionalities. In this paper, we describe the Smart Geo Layers middleware, its implementation, and its application through an urban planning application within the smart city initiative of Natal, Brazil.},

  abstract={The accelerated urbanization process can cause several traffic problems, such as congestion, environmental, and noise pollution [1]-[3]. The system hardware developed consists of an actuator circuit, for the switching of AC/DC lamps and a sensor circuit, to check if the lamps are burnt out [4]. The microcontroller's firmware performs all the control logic, timing and traffic light safety for each type of crossing [5], [6]. For all traffic lights at all intersections to operate as intended, a wireless communication network with a specific communication protocol was used to mediate the information exchange between the traffic lights at intersections and its control center [7]. Safety routines [8]-[10] have been designed so that, in the event of technical problems (burnt-out lamp, electrical or communication failure) with one or more traffic lights at a given intersection, all traffic lights immediately go into alert mode and notify the situation to the traffic management center. The wireless traffic light controller system (according to Fig. 1) allows the green wave [11], [12] implementation for successive intersections. The system validation was based on the comparison of the theoretical and practical time diagrams, so that in all situations in which the system was exposed, it acted in the way it was designed.},

  abstract={Many cities around the world have been looking for implementation of strategies and projects focused on smart cities development to move on. However, it does not happen instantly and without conflicts of interest. In fact, the main difficulties of a strategy emerge during the implementation phase, because cities present several limitations of governance, capabilities, financing tools and so on. An alternative to solve these issues refers to the creation of a dedicated organizational structure to lead the collaboration between stakeholders in this process of urban transformation. Despite their relevance, there are few studies addressing how these smart cities dedicated organizations are constituted and structured, what tools and mechanisms they use and what is their role in the development of different urban innovation ecosystems are still scarce, especially with evidence from developing countries. Therefore, this paper aims to (1) analyze the structure, tools, and mechanisms of smart city dedicated organizations around the world and (2) to characterize their role in the governance of smart city development. Multiple case studies were conducted based on the documental analysis of websites, reports and official documents and interviews with directors of six smart city dedicated organizations from European and Brazilian cities. From this study, we expect to contribute with propositions and insights on how to structure a new governance model for smart cities development in different contexts.},

In this context, this paper proposes a new development framework to guide the programming and operation of multi-sensor detection units that are able to be reconfigured in real time. Moreover, supportive networked elements and interaction messages are proposed within this framework to allow flexible reconfiguration requests in a distributed and scalable way.

  abstract={Electric vehicles represent one of the most promising technological innovations in promoting smart cities and smart transport systems concepts. However, the charging infrastructure is the main drawback to increasing the adoption of electric vehicles. The limited number of charging stations in the cities is an obstacle to the wide adoption of electric vehicles. Therefore, this work proposes to study solutions for the location and installation of charging stations in the context of smart cities. The paper presents three solutions: (i) random, being a naive approach for comparison; (ii) pseudo-random, where the road map is divided into quadrants and a charging station is installed randomly within each quadrant; and (iii) pseudo-greedy, in which the road map is divided into quadrants and the most visited street by vehicles within the quadrant is selected to install a charging station. These approaches are compared using the TAPAS Cologne map and an urban mobility simulator, which considers electric vehicles and charging during their routes.},

  pages={252-257},
  abstract={A Living lab (LL) allows the development of systems in a user-driven fashion in realistic environments. Despite the idea behind LL is promising, its development is still an open problem. This occurs in part because the concept of LL is still in development, does not have clear boundaries, and the discussion around the theme transcends many disciplines. We have faced some of these uncertainties when a customer asked us to develop a LL environment for Smart Cities. This scenario motivated us to perform a mapping study with the purpose of characterizing LLs, their challenges, domains where they can be applied, and software architecture aspects related to the theme. As result, 51 primary studies were identified and six aspects of them were analyzed: LL characteristics, application domains, LLs smart cities initiatives, challenges, and current evidence on software architecture for LL. The results are beneficial for both researchers and practitioners. For researchers, this work provides information about the current status of LL research, as well as topics that require further investigation. For practitioners, the paper discusses challenges that they need to be prepared to face when developing LLs, as well as aspects related to software architecture and considered application domains. The organized set of information can support development teams on the conception of new LLs.},

  abstract={The interoperability of multiple sensors is a crucial feature for emergency management in smart cities because they allow more comprehensive perceptions of critical situations by Emergency Detection Units (EDUs). The flexibility of multi-sensor units may also ensure that a system is tailored to fit different environments and situations. Since smart cities are inherently prone to emergencies, which may happen anywhere and in an unpredictable way, this paper proposes a development architecture that enables interoperability and dynamic configuration of sensors attached to an EDU. Such an architecture is proposed to allow dynamic insertion and removal of physical sensors, which incorporate some metadata to allow any EDU to dynamically adapt to new physical configurations. By combining a plug-and-play feature enabled by the use of custom Transducer Data Sheets (TEDS) inspired by the IEEE 1451 standard, the proposed architecture expects to reduce configuration and deployment times while reducing development costs, potentially improving emergency management systems in smart cities.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) has become of great importance in the last decades. The term is used to denote the connectivity between electronic devices that allows the collect and sharing of data through the Internet. IoT technologies can be applied to automate and minimize problems related to urbanization in Smart City scenarios. In this context, MQTT brokers (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) are used to enable communication between IoT devices. Brokers are responsible for enabling connection and sending of messages between devices. The current literature presents a wide variety of brokers and to choose the suitable solution for the project, which can lead to performance problems, may become a hard task. Thus, the objective of this paper is to analyze the performance of MQTT brokers regarding latency in the data packets sending, and to present advantages and drawbacks of the solutions in Smart Cities scenarios. Results showed that the computer hardware features and the bandwidth used have a greater impact on the latency, showing that several factors can influence the performance of brokers.},

  abstract={A considerable volume of data is collected from sensors today and needs to be processed in real time. Complex Event Processing (CEP) is one of the most important techniques developed for this purpose. In CEP, each new sensor measurement is considered an event and new event types can be defined based on other events occurrence. There exists several open-source CEP implementations currently available, but all of them use orchestration to distribute event processing. This kind of architectural organization may harm system resilience, since it relies on a central core (i.e. the orchestrator). Any failures in the core might impact the whole system. Moreover, the core can become a bottleneck on system performance. In this work, a choreography-based microservices architecture is proposed for distributed CEP, in order to benefit from the low coupling and greater horizontal scalability this kind of architecture provides.},

  abstract={Smart Cities currently utilize computational solutions to enhance the quality of life for their citizens. However, these systems can be complex to integrate as they are often isolated, heterogeneous, and maintained by distinct organizations at different activity levels. The System of System (SoS) concept is one way to promote interoperability. SoS is a collection of several isolated systems that act interoperably as part of a more extensive and intricate system, forming a cohesive and complex entity. Smart cities can benefit by using SoS to integrate services and develop new features. However, SoS has some limitations, such as increased costs, limited collaboration, and mistrust of shared data and functionalities. Blockchain technology can be used to establish a trusted decentralized controller entity through a consensus mechanism among network participants to overcome these challenges. Therefore, this paper presents an architecture that combines Blockchain with SoS theory to enable trusted interoperability among Smart Cities systems. Finally, we conduct a stress test to evaluate the proposed solution.},

Therefore, this research work presents the development of an intelligent public lighting prototype based on a simple light controller. The system aims to improve this process by addressing some parameters, such as lighting power and saving light through a pedestrian presence sensor. The implementation of the public lighting system is based on LEDs because it provides low energy consumption. Besides, this research also provides an economic analysis of the proposed device to evaluate its applicability and possible benefits. The results proved the efficiency and flexibility of the proposed smart device. The use of the proposed prototype, along with the replacement of less efficient technologies by LED luminaires, generates an economic return that varies between 33.25 - 427.84 R$/year; leading to a return on investment of 24.16 % to 937.02 % at the end of the system&#x2019;s useful life.},

  abstract={The unprecedented capabilities of monitoring and responding to stimuli in the physical world of wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSAN) enable these networks to provide the underpinning for several Smart City applications, such as structural health monitoring (SHM). In such applications, civil structures, endowed with wireless smart devices, are able to self-monitor and autonomously respond to situations using computational intelligence. This work presents a decentralized algorithm for detecting damage in structures by using a WSAN. As key characteristics, beyond presenting a fully decentralized (in-network) and collaborative approach for detecting damage in structures, our algorithm makes use of cooperative information fusion for calculating a damage coefficient. We conducted experiments for evaluating the algorithm in terms of its accuracy and efficient use of the constrained WSAN resources. We found that our collaborative and information fusion-based approach ensures the accuracy of our algorithm and that it can answer promptly to stimuli (1.091 s), triggering actuators. Moreover, for 100 nodes or less in the WSAN, the communication overhead of our algorithm is tolerable and the WSAN running our algorithm, operating system and protocols can last as long as 468 days.},

  abstract={Information and Communication Technologies are indispensable components of smart cities. Its applications are present in several areas, such as urban mobility, environmental issues and medical systems. In this scenario, the use of crowdsourcing technologies comes to help people to contribute to the development and improvement of the urban digital services. However, using crowdsourced data in smart cities solutions can lead to problems with the security and the privacy of user's data. The setting of comprehensive Functional Requirements (FR) to ensure data privacy is an approach for preventing the occurrence of such issues. In this work, we intend to identify, from a literature review the main privacy requirements that have been observed in the development of applications that make use of crowdsourced data in Smart Cities scenarios.},

  abstract={The advent of the Internet of Things (IoT) and its innumerous applications for Smart Cities emphasizes the need for context-aware systems able to adapt behavior automatically to instant environment conditions. Currently, there is a gap in terms of understanding how context information is interrelated, as well as tracking which events occurred under which conditions within certain context scopes. Visualizing, specifying, tracking and monitoring typical contexts involved in IoT-based applications are still challenging activities since context modeling remains a low level process that requires much human expertise. In this paper we propose a new context life cycle that involves context design and context tracking. We developed a context-aware management framework, where contexts are modeled as graphs and can be explicitly designed and their occurrences can be tracked down. We believe that this feature of designing and tracking context graphs may help developers, administrators, and end-users in harnessing the wealth of information generated by highly scalable IoT systems.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is getting momentum, which drives us to design solutions able to deal with huge amounts of data coming from different sorts of sensors in order to make decisions to adapt system behavior automatically. While in recent years many IoT-based reasoning systems have already been proposed, there are no comprehensive results reporting their performance, particularly in complex environments. As an answer to that challenge, developers often choose an architecture design based on previous experience that have an impact on the system performance and scalability. This paper shows experimental results of a performance analysis study of different implementations of context-aware management architectures for IoT-based smart cities. Results show that different architectural choices affect system scalability and that automatic real time decision-making is feasible in an environment composed of dozens of thousands of sensors continuously transmitting data.},

  abstract={Smart cities initiatives have the potential to improve the life of citizens in a huge number of dimensions. One of them is the development of techniques and services capable of contributing to the enhancement of security public policies. Finding criminal patterns from historical data would arguably help in predicting and even preventing thefts and burglaries that continuously increase in urban centers worldwide. However, accessing such history and finding patterns across the interrelated crime occurrences data are challenging tasks, particularly to underdevelopment countries. In this paper, we address these problems by combining three techniques: we collect crime data from existing crowd-sourcing systems, we automatically induce patterns with relational machine learning, and we manage the entire process using scientific workflows. The framework developed under these lines is named CRiMINaL (Crime patteRn MachINe Learning). Experimental results conducted from a popular Brazilian source of data and a traditional relational learning system shows that CRiMINaL is a promising tool to induce interpretable models that can assist police departments on crime prevention.},

  abstract={This paper is about a fifth generation (5G) network technology structure model that is a facilitator that can provide new services to several segments in smart cities. It was verified that applications in smart cities include citizens and pervasive devices interaction which requires continuous monitoring to provide collaborative support and to raise environmental awareness. In order to implement the expected goals from the 5G ecosystem, this model incorporates software defined network and virtualized controllers to support new services. Examples of smart city services are traffic efficiency, security, surveillance, localization, healthcare services, infrastructure support among others. Any of these services will be able to get information from their users and from the network through our model, once an important issue in smart city is the challenge to collect or deliver useful and processed data to stakeholders. In this proposal, the evaluation of the model was conducted through emulations on Mininet and POX controllers. The results were analyzed using the Gephi tool, and they have demonstrated that the proposed model is applicable to support and provide new services such as intelligent transportation, road monitoring, energy consumption, public safety among others in smart cities.},

We conducted a study utilizing clustering techniques as part of unsupervised learning to analyze the criminal macrocauses of such crimes. We explored different clustering strategies to identify the optimal number of clusters to group the ILCV data of the state of Rio Grande do Norte. By grouping this criminal data and applying the Distortion, Silhouette, and Calinski-Harabasz scores, we reached an ideal number of two to three clusters. Our findings align with smart city initiatives and present an opportunity to integrate data-driven approaches, theory, and machine learning techniques into public safety measures.},

  abstract={The growth in the number of traffic accidents has become a cause for concern in urban centers. As a result of the increase in population in large cities and the number of vehicles, the consequences of accidents and congestion can be even more significant, considering the impacts on the economy, environment and people's quality of life. Therefore, aiming to minimize these impacts, we present ALIVE, a distributed and Vanet-based solution that reduces congestion caused by different sources and, especially, from accident sources, contributing to efficient urban mobility in smart cities. The solution performs the detection of accidents and the dissemination of warning messages in multiple hops. Besides, the system can share the road traffic information with the nearby streets to improve traffic efficiency. We evaluated the proposed solution with PANDORA and NRR Traffic Management solutions. Simulation results indicate that the proposed solution reduces the average travel time, time lost, and the number of transmitted messages.},

  abstract={The rapid urbanization process in the last century has deeply changed the way we live and interact with each other. As most people now live in urban areas, cities are experiencing growing demands for more efficient and sustainable public services that may improve the perceived quality of life, specially with the anticipated impacts of climatic changes. In this already complex scenario with increasingly overcrowded urban areas, different types of emergency situations may happen anywhere and anytime, with unpredictable costs in human lives and economic losses. In order to cope with unexpected and potentially dangerous emergencies, smart cities initiatives have been developed in different cities, addressing multiple aspects of emergencies detection, alerting, and mitigation. In this context, this article surveys recent smart city solutions for crisis management, proposing definitions for emergencies-oriented systems and classifying them according to the employed technologies and provided services. Additionally, recent developments in the domains of Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence and Big Data are also highlighted when associated to the management of urban emergencies, potentially paving the way for new developments while classifying and organizing them according to different criteria. Finally, open research challenges will be identified, indicating promising trends and research directions for the coming years.},

  abstract={IoT is rapidly progressing and gaining focus in the domain of smart cities. It copes with a lot of economy sectors by enabling to save resources efficiently, be human or material. Also, it allows creating simple applications to ease some tasks of people's daily lives. However, the development of IoT applications is not always a straightforward task, as sensors and actuators are not always readily usable. Furthermore, in scenarios where IoT devices can move unrestrictedly and are not continuously available, the dynamism can pose some challenges for developers. In this sense, the Internet of Mobile Things (IoMT) is an IoT instance where devices are mobile (i.e. not attached to fixed power supplies). To address this issue, we developed the ObsAct programming model. ObsAct is a layer built on top of the ContextNet IoMT middleware that allows programming reactive rule-based applications. In this paper, we will present use case scenarios where ObsAct is used to cope with the Smart Cities challenges. In addition, we show an evaluation of our solution and discuss its outcomes.},

  abstract={One of the most critical issues in Smart Cities (SC) is how to use the energy system properly. The capacity to provide more detailed consumption information and more accurate consumer feedback is an essential step towards energy sustainability. On the end-user side, a system that supports the measurement of several points of consumption and provides visual information can help consumers reduce energy waste. On the other side, electric utilities can use a real-time measurement system to infer the energy consumption behavior, to find metering inconsistencies, to optimize the system, or to maintain the reliability of the supply system based on data information. This work presents a demand-side management Framework for smart cities which aims to provide integration between consumers and energy distribution utilities. This Framework can help the electricity demand control, presenting real-time consumption data and presenting relevant data on their consumption points to consumers. A prototype was developed as a proof of concept.},

  abstract={The coronavirus pandemic challenged smart cities to encourage citizens towards the social distance, as well as to optimize health and policing resources allocation. Mobile apps have played an unprecedented role during this pandemic to enable citizens to participate and interact with social issues while raising concerns about privacy and surveillance. In a partnership of the Natal smart city initiative of the university and the public ministry, we deployed the “Tô de Olho” (TdO) platform for integrating different sectors of society against coronavirus spreading in the state of RN, Brazil. In less than four months, TdO reached more than 20,000 users with several user roles, functionalities and a strictly defined privacy policy. Location data allows TdO to notify users when they have possible suspicious contact with an infected person or have gone through virus hot zones. The platform also helps city health officials to select people for infectious testing, according to user information on symptoms, comorbid diseases, contact with infected people, risk status and QR health code. Our integration with private institutions enables employers to know which employees have tested positive to protect work environments. We discuss the partnerships involved with TdO's deployment and compare our context with related apps around the world, suggesting that public scrutiny, government investments and integration with active applications in the city are essential to achieving massive use. Further, we evaluate the feedback of active users (N=175), analyzing the positive points and advising improvements for future work on participatory applications during an epidemic.},

With the reduction in manual work and the adoption of automation, cities are getting more efficient and smarter. However, this evolution also made data even more sensitive, especially in the industrial segment. The latter has caught the attention of many hackers targeting Industrial IoT (IIoT) devices or networks, hence the number of malicious software, i.e., malware, has increased as well. In this article, we present the IIoT concept and applications for smart cities, besides also presenting the security challenges faced by this emerging area. We survey currently available deep learning (DL) techniques for IIoT in smart cities, mainly deep reinforcement learning, recurrent neural networks, and convolutional neural networks, and highlight the advantages and disadvantages of security-related methods. We also present insights, open issues, and future trends applying DL techniques to enhance IIoT security.},

  abstract={The paper is introducing an adoption of Industry 4.0 Concept on Smart City theoretic model. Cities are upgraded with latest computing and ICT technologies throughout all systems and infrastructure. New data are collected in big amounts and ability to use them is changing how city subsystems can communicate together, to make cities work better and serve better to their users. Smart Cities are convoluted Cyber Physical Model Systems with gradually growing network of all of its parts including human social networks. Cities are under continuous development, in relation to attractiveness of city structure, based on all activities and transactions conducted in city area and related surrounding, newly also through connected virtual world. Industry 4.0 Concept is one of segments of city's recent or near future upgrade. Integration of advanced computing technology and Information Computing Technology throughout whole production enterprise enable to share data, information, and instructions between all agents during all phases of product lifecycle, a product partially participating as a vehicle of product development instructions. Industry 4.0 concept includes six principles, which are compared to Smart City near to 4.0 model. Triangle Rule Diagram is introduced to investigate relationships between all main domains in city live — Client, Enterprise and Facilitator at concept of Smart City near to 4.0, where integration of computing technologies is embedded in all of these domains and inside all city systems and processes connecting them together. Services become a predominantly main city's product as outcome of City Enterprise. Ability to carry portion of instruction about product development is part of new Smart city near 4.0 concept, as well as during post-product development phases.},

  pages={30-43},
  abstract={As a result of rural and suburban migration to the cities, urban life has become a significant challenge for citizens and, particularly, for city administrators who must manage the sustainable use of resources such as energy, water, and transportation. Smart cities are the biggest vision to efficiently address these challenges through a real-time monitoring, providing an intelligent planning and a sustainable urban development. However, to accomplish them we need a tightly integration among citizens, city devices, city administrators, and the data center platform where all data is stored, combined, and processed. In this context, we propose ElCity, a model that combines citizens and city devices data to enable an elastic multilevel management of energy consumption for a particular city. As design decision, this management must occur automatically without affecting the quality of already offered services. The main contribution of ElCity model concerns the exploration of the cloud elasticity concept in multiple target levels (smartphones from citizens, city devices involved in the public lightning, and data center nodes), turning on or off the resources on each level in accordance with their demands. In this way, this article presents the ElCity architecture, detailing its modules distributed along the three data sources, in addition to an experiment that uses city devices and citizens data from Rome to explore energy saving. The results are promising, with an Energy Monitor module that allows the estimation of the energy consumption of elastic applications based on CPU and memory traces with an average and median precision of 97.15 and 97.72 percent. Moreover, we proposed a reduction of more than 90 percent in the energy spent in public lightning in the city of Rome which was obtained thanks to an analysis of geolocation data from their citizens.},

The algorithm records the geolocation of the vehicle every 30 seconds, which can lead to unnecessary coordinates being sent and the communication network being overloaded. The aim of this work is to develop an algorithm that is able to determine the location of a moving object based on its angular position. The proposed algorithm uses an inertial measurement unit sensor to determine the change of direction and is able to correctly determine the route even if a coordinate is lost. We conducted an experimental study comparing the periodic approach with angular position-based approach on a route of a public bus in the city of Toledo/PR. The results show that the angle-based algorithm reduces the number of transmitted coordinates by up to 30%.},

  abstract={Modern cities are subject to a lot of periodic or unexpected critical events, which may have different monitoring and control requirements according to the expected impacts on people safety and urban mobility. When multiple monitoring and automation systems are deployed, adaptive wireless sensor networks may adjust sensing and transmission configurations according to the detected events, optimizing the network overall operation. In this context, mobile sinks come as an effective way to enhance monitoring performance in smart city environments. However, practical issues related to the available roads and traffic load should be considered, allowing the computation of the best final positions and movement paths for each sink. Therefore, this paper proposes algorithms to compute dynamic sinks movement in reactive wireless sensor networks, supporting efficient adaptation to event-based monitoring in smart cities.},

  year={2022},
  volume={9},
  number={10},
  pages={7128-7139},
  abstract={In the industry 4.0 era, the visualization and real-time automatic monitoring of smart cities supported by the Internet of Things is becoming increasingly important. The use of filtering algorithms in smart city monitoring is a feasible method for this purpose. However, maintaining fast and accurate monitoring in complex surveillance environments with restricted resources remains a major challenge. Since the cognitive theory in visual monitoring is difficult to realize in practice, efficient monitoring of complex environments is accordingly hard to be achieved. Moreover, current monitoring methods do not consider the particularities of the human cognitive system, so the remonitoring ability of the process/target is weak in case of monitoring failure by the monitoring system. To overcome these issues, this article proposes a novel human short-long cognitive memory mechanism for video surveillance in smart cities. In this mechanism, a memory with a high reliability target is used as a “long-term memory,” whereas a memory with a low reliability target is used as a “short-term memory.” During the monitoring process, the “short-term memory” and “long-term memory” alternation strategy is combined with the stored target appearance characteristics, ensuring that the original model in the memory will not be contaminated or mislaid by changes in the external environment (occlusion, fast motion, motion blur, and background clutter). Extensive simulations showcase that the algorithm proposed in this article not only improves the monitoring speed without hindering its real-time operation but also monitors and traces the monitored target accurately, ultimately improving the robustness of the detection in complex scenery, and enabling its application to IoT-assisted smart cities.},

We discuss some use case examples related to monitoring and predicting bus arrivals in public transportation and weather conditions. We also present performance results in different scenarios that point to the feasibility of our goal: a scalable architecture with a fast response time to traffic events. MUSANet is based on a three-tier architecture distributed over the cloud, fog, and edge, and supporting complex event processing (CEP) in all of them. Although the system is under development using the InterSCity platform in the cloud, the ContextNet middleware at the fog, and the Mobile-Hub platform at the edge, the MUSANet architecture can be deployed using other platforms, maintaining the concept of tiering responsibilities to minimize network bandwidth and delay, group communication, and broad mobile support.},

  abstract={In order to efficiently manage emergency situations in cities, it is crucial to have a well-distributed network of emergency response centres that can quickly initiate mitigation actions. Conversely, such infrastructure can also be leveraged when designing emergency management systems in smart cities. To enable this in any city, we have developed a risk classification system that uses open geospatial data to preprocess urban areas. For that, we exploited the previous concepts of Area of Interest (AoI) and Points of Interest (PoI), extending them to also incorporate the concept of Area of Mitigation (AoM) for any regular or irregular polygonal AoI, considerably enhancing the definition of risk perceptions in a city. Additionally, we have proposed a new algorithm that finds realistic positions for Event Detection Units (EDUs) based on the streets in a city, avoiding prohibited deployment areas, which was in fact a deficiency of previous algorithms for this problem. By potentially reducing the time required to detect and notify emergency events in more critical urban areas, we want to improve the performance of emergency management systems as a whole, bringing important contributions for smart city applications in this area.},

  pages={33176-33188},
  abstract={IoT networks are transitioning towards greener underlying technologies. In smart cities environments, while some devices are already sustainable with rechargeable batteries and energy harvesting hardware, many still rely on traditional non-sustainable components. This partial sustainable Internet of Things (IoT) network poses a research challenge, since the profile of sustainable nodes aims for neutral or self-powered operation, which may conflict with the energy-saving goals of traditional non-sustainable nodes. In this challenging scenario, it is essential to share Energy Information (EI), i.e. battery state-of-charge, among the nodes to efficiently manage energy resources. However, EI sharing is valuable data for attackers to perform energy-based attacks, exploiting the most vulnerable nodes in smart cities. To tackle these problems, this article presents the Dual Energy PROfile for interNet-of-thiNgs with Enhanced Security (DEPRONN-ES), which is a solution designed to support partially sustainable networks, i.e. traditional and sustainable nodes, and applies differential privacy to enhance data privacy levels of the EI sharing. The performed evaluation shows the proposed solution is able to reduce the success rate of attacks in 87% and its effectiveness in terms of consumed resources of the attacked node. Besides, DEPRONN-ES is able to support conflicting profiles to operate in distinct energy consumption levels. This framework utilized emulation of IoT devices and real data traces of indoor light intensity measurements provided by Columbia University as a harvesting source of the rechargeable batteries of sustainable nodes.},

  abstract={The adoption of sensors-based monitoring approaches has opened up a range of possibilities for data recovery, distributed processing, and quality evaluations in urban scenarios. In this evolving scenario, efficient emergency management systems provides a fundamental service for modern cities, exploiting different sensing and processing technologies for the real-time handling of critical situations. Actually, such systems are expected to implement emergency detection, alerting and mitigation services in order to avoid or relieve the negative impacts of critical events on the inhabitants’ perceived quality of life. In this sense, after a critical event is properly detected, emergency vehicles may be dispatched as quickly as possible to respond to such detected situations, potentially reducing the probability of deaths and injuries. Therefore, this paper proposes a selection algorithm to dispatch emergency vehicles in smart cities, assuming that emergency alerts are dynamically released exploiting any support system. Then, dispatched vehicles are prioritized as they move on a city, by optimizing the operation of traffic lights. Such an optimization approach is implemented and evaluated using different simulation tools and programming libraries, providing important contributions to emergency management in smart cities.},

  abstract={The advancement of smart cities relies heavily on the efficiency and reliability of wireless network connectivity, enabling a wide range of applications and services. However, evaluating the quality of network connectivity for smart city applications is a complex task. It requires the consideration of multiple factors such as security, throughput and reliability, besides the proper analysis in terms of the financial cost to provide the infrastructure for these networks. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel metric for assessing the connectivity of wireless networks in smart cities, takes into account those multiple factors (security, throughput, reliability and cost). It aims to provide specific measurements for different types of networks, fostering a comprehensive evaluation of their connections. Furthermore, a global index is introduced to estimate the overall connectivity quality across the entire application, which is linked to the coverage provided by each network. By employing these metrics, valuable guidance can be obtained to evaluate and compare various network connections, supporting decision-making during the design and (re)deployment phases. The effectiveness of these metrics is validated through simulations and case studies, demonstrating their practical applicability and relevance.},

Landslides can take a long time to collapse completely, and collecting data in real situations can imply a long-term collection, with no guarantees of recording the phenomenon. Promoting accelerated experiments can be an alternative for evaluating algorithms to detect soil movement. Therefore, this paper presents the results of two experiments performed for data collection by inertial sensors deployed in sandy soil in a dump truck.

However, WSN relies on unreliable communication medium that is susceptible to noise and interference, which results in loss of information through the route to the data aggregator. Unlike existing TCP and UDP protocols, a new transport protocol is required to meet the specifications of a wireless sensor network. In order to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) in the communication medium, this work describes a new communication protocol, which aims to guarantee the delivery of packages. Such protocol uses a new transmission acknowledges system, providing higher reliability in peer-to-peer transmissions. With this method, it is shown that even without a network buffer, it is possible to achieve better reliability in harsh environments than others well-known methods. In this way, this protocol guarantees the end-to-end data delivery, using a minimum amount of device memory.},

  abstract={The growth of smart city applications is increasingly around the world, many cities invest in the development of these systems intending to improve the management and life of their residents. This increase is mainly due to the emergence of new technologies such as Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT). Some of the biggest challenges in applying these systems, relate to the processing, visualization, and analysis of the generated data, since most systems tend to work connected, thus generating a large mass of data that deviates from the standard of previously used systems. For data visualization, one of the main devices used is the reduction of dimensionality, in an attempt to bring data from one dimension N to two or three dimensions and thus be noticeable to human eyes. There are several algorithms used for dimensionality reduction, the linear ones that as the name implies, solve linearly separable problems and so these are very limited and the nonlinear ones, that solve more complex problems, but usually have an excessive runtime, making them or often inappropriate to apply. This article presents the parallel implementation of the nonlinear dimension reduction algorithm t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), showing better results than its conventional version in terms of runtime, thus showing that parallelism can make the problem of dimensionality reduction treatable, bringing greater scalability and delivering results within an acceptable time frame.},

  abstract={Recently, patrol planning and other predictive policing strategies were improved for Smart Cities applications. In such public safety context, some police departments have been recording crime events in their databases to compose better strategies to understand and predict crime incidence. This work presents the ROTA-Analytics, a web-based application which aims to provide crime incidence forecasting as outputs. This crime incident forecasting helps patrol supervisors to elaborate the list of predefined locations (points) and staying time at which each police vehicle must patrol. ROTA-Analytics supports multiple machine and statistical learning methods selection to create an environment of crime prediction in different areas of the city. All the phases from time series creation to the automatic machine selection are discussed and exemplified with real data from Natal City in Brazil. Finally, we evaluated our architecture by using two regression strategies for different spatial granularity levels.},

  pages={1-8},
  abstract={Large cities seek to incorporate intelligent systems into their infrastructure, industrial, educational, and social activities to improve the quality of service provided to citizens and make all processes more efficient. To this end, these cities use technologies that involve the areas of the Internet of Things, Big Data, and Governance to make decisions by governments and authorities. In the field of Urban Computing, it is possible to use open data in the GTFS format to solve the problems of the urban transport system using complex network metrics that make it possible to model complex interactions between objects in high dimensionality. Stops and routes are modeled as a graph, characterized by complex network metrics. According to the literature, if there is an interruption of the urban transport system, we make an evaluation of the degree of vulnerability of the system in the search for solutions. The main goal of this paper is to propose an approach to analyze the vulnerability of the urban transport system using complex network metrics along with GTFS data in scenarios targeted failures. As a contribution, the proposed approach uses the concept of skewness in the methodology established in the literature. The skewness enables a better understanding and differential the failure conditions from the evaluation of the vulnerability the urban transport system, through a quantitative indication of which local metrics most influence the decay of network metrics. The analysis of the results obtained in the proposed approach serves as a subsidy for studies in the search for solutions to the problems of the urban transport system, providing a tool to the set of technological options for the planning of urban transport systems of smart cities available to governments and authorities. The proposed approach can be applied in different cities, regardless of their size and location, as long as you have access to open geographic data in the GTFS format.},

The architecture we are proposing has three hierarchical levels, and supports complex event processing (CEP) in several of them. At the lower layer, several mobile objects work as interfaces to sensors and actuators and provide processing capability for local filtering and detection. A second level, consisting of gateways and processing nodes, processes information from its locale and sends the data received from the mobile objects to the storage level using the existing network infrastructure. The highest level provides support for structured storage and queries of the information. Applications outside the platform can collect data through the external interface of the highest level. The system is under development using the InterSCity platform in the upper layer, the ContextNet middleware at the middle layer, and the Mobile-Hub application at the lower layer.

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm has witnessed remarkable growth in recent years, fostered by its vast market potential and its wide-ranging application across numerous domains. Among them, IoT applications in Smart Cities have stood out, with a significant focus on the development of cyber-physical systems that play a crucial role in the early detection of critical situations and the implementation of prompt actions to avert potential disasters. However, in order for these solutions to become more resilient and reliable, it is necessary for such IoT devices to have the ability to react immediately and adapt to the heterogeneity and dynamism of the sensed environments. These characteristics can be achieved through over-the-air (OTA) update strategies, which can remotely update and modify the software and firmware of electronic devices through wireless communications, without the need for physical or manual intervention. In this context, this paper proposes an OTA approach for the flexible operation of emergency detection units in smart cities, which might promote the integration of new requirements for critical events monitoring through remote updates, achieving a high degree of deployment, automation, and runtime scalability. Principles of authenticity and nonrepudiation are also taken into consideration to ensure security and reliability during the update and operation processes of these units. The logical operation of such new IoT devices are described herein, as well as the performed evaluation procedures.},

  abstract={Facing uncertainty catalyzed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the decision-making of information and communication technology (ICT) managers in smart cities has become essential for technological development. This exploratory study describes the effects of ICT governance practices and the use of Industry 4.0 technologies on the decision-making of technology managers in Brazilian cities considered smart in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, 39 municipalities were selected based on classifications of Brazilian smart cities, and data were collected through the electronic citizen service system and a survey application. It identified the use of the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) and the ICT Master Plan (PDTIC) as the cities’ ICT governance practices. Regarding Industry 4.0 technologies, the use of business intelligence (BI), cloud computing (CC), and open data was verified. Furthermore, the need to develop a planning culture and the need for internal training of professionals in the face of new technological resources emerged. The results showed that ICT governance practices and Industry 4.0 technologies have positive effects if used holistically according to the alignment with the municipality’s strategic objectives. The senior management of municipalities must see the importance of making constant investments in infrastructure and the technical capacity of professionals to achieve greater effectiveness in the use of technological resources.},

  abstract={Cyber-attacks and threats are growing fast in the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure as applications in smart cities gain momentum. Usually, IoT devices communicate via machine-to-machine protocols such as Message Queuing Telemetry Transport (MQTT). Due to the heterogeneous structure in IoT and the absence of security by design methodologies, security mechanisms in environments with MQTT traffic are needed, and they can be deployed as Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS). This paper proposes a Deep Learning (DL) based Network IDS trained using a public dataset containing MQTT attacks. We assess the proposal using standard performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and weighted average. When evaluating the performance of our DL-based Network IDS, it obtained, in average, 97.09% of accuracy and an F1-score equal to 98.33% in the detection of MQTT attacks. Another important contribution of our work is the sharing of the experiments on GitHub, which guarantees the reproducibility of the research.},

  abstract={Blockchain technology has been applied to various applications (e.g., smart buildings and smart cities) that typically run in an environment of smart devices, known as Internet-of-Things (IoT). To support these applications, different blockchain architectures, data structures and consensus algorithms have been proposed, tailored to IoT. One such proposal, appendable-block blockchain, is a promising blockchain framework for use in IoT environments. It provides a scalable data structure that allows parallel insertions between independent nodes. However, it has some limitations, in particular related to the possible eclipse attack by malicious gateways and the lack of consensus for transactions insertion. To solve these issues, we propose a new consensus mechanism for appendable-block blockchains, called context-based consensus. Using context-based consensus, information can be inserted in parallel across devices (called context) while ensuring that light-weight consensus is performed to guarantee that a transaction is well-formed and it is placed in the correct order. We implemented context-based consensus and show that using multiple contexts reduces latency and increases the throughput of transaction insertions when compared to consensus without contexts or using single transaction consensus.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is increasingly present in our daily activities, connecting the most varied types of physical devices present around us to the internet. IoT is the basis for smart cities, e-health, precision agriculture, among others. With this growth, the number of cyber-attacks against these types of devices and services has also increased. Each type of attack has its specific characteristics that allow its identification and prevention through machine learning techniques. However, classic machine learning techniques may have their performance compromised due to the non-stationary characteristics of these environments, together with the search for different types of vulnerabilities by attackers, attacks can suffer different types of mutations, in addition to the great possibility of new types of attacks arising over time. In this article, we propose an algorithm called Fuzzy Intrusion Detection System for IoT Networks (FROST) to identify cyber-attacks on IoT networks. FROST uses the concepts of fuzzy set theory to make the learning task more flexible, seeking to improve the performance in the classification of inaccurate data. In addition, FROST has a mechanism for identifying new types of intrusion online, during the classification of new instances. To evaluate our approach, we used the UNSW-NB15 data set and compared our method with another approach, very consolidated in the literature, which performs the same type of task. The results showed that FROST has a good performance in the classification of different types of attacks and that the fuzzy technique used helped to reduce errors and identify anomalies.},

  pages={1013-1025},
  abstract={Edge computing (EC) is a promising technology capable of bridging the gap between Cloud computing services and the demands of emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT). Most EC-based solutions, from wearable devices to smart cities architectures, benefit from Machine Learning (ML) methods to perform various tasks, such as classification. In these cases, ML solutions need to deal efficiently with a huge amount of data, while balancing predictive performance, memory and time costs, and energy consumption. The fact that these data usually come in the form of a continuous and evolving data stream makes the scenario even more challenging. Many algorithms have been proposed to cope with data stream classification, e.g., Very Fast Decision Tree (VFDT) and Strict VFDT (SVFDT). Recently, Online Local Boosting (OLBoost) has also been introduced to improve predictive performance without modifying the underlying structure of the decision tree produced by these algorithms. In this work, we compared the four-way relationship among time efficiency, energy consumption, predictive performance, and memory costs, tuning the hyperparameters of VFDT and the two versions of SVFDT with and without OLBoost. Experiments over 6 benchmark datasets using an EC device revealed that VFDT and SVFDT-I were the most energy-friendly algorithms, with SVFDT-I also significantly reducing memory consumption. OLBoost, as expected, improved the predictive performance, but caused a deterioration in memory and energy consumption.},

  volume={21},
  number={22},
  pages={25831-25842},
  abstract={This work proposes a data sampling algorithm for smart cities applications based on sensor network infrastructure. Our algorithm identifies the sensor data behavior through the Causality Complexity-Entropy Plane and performs data reduction by removing redundant data without losing the system’s properties. For this, we recognize the systems’ dynamic changes in real-time through a delimiter, named Maximum Complexity Point (MCP). Thus, we determine when to update the sampling period to maximize the system’s information content, i.e., the statistical complexity quantifier. To confirm the sampling adaptability, we apply our method in three different chaotic attractors: Rossler, Lorenz, and  ${B}_{7}$ . We compared our solution with two other sampling algorithms: (i) random histogram-based sampling and the  ${L}$  algorithm. We use the K-S test, the average Data Error, and the Causality Complexity-Entropy Plane to compare the results. Using our sampling approach, we observed K-S test distances less than 3% for chaotic maps and 1% for natural environments data. The best results were in the Data Error, showing an average error rate up to 13.4% lower when evaluating chaotic data and 15.7% lower when evaluating natural environments. Regarding the dispersion of points in the Causality Complexity-Entropy Plane, the sampled time-series reached regions of higher statistical complexity, indicating that they preserved information content, hence the original data’s dynamics.},

V2X communication has the potential to improve traffic in smart cities drastically, but it plays a crucial role in terms of safety and the environment. The V2X communication can be completely impaired due to cyberattacks, including radio jamming, where the electromagnetic spectrum is interfered or blocked.

  abstract={Several countries have implemented automatic meter readings to bill basic services. It requires smart meters and the deployment of communication networks (wired or wireless). Several companies offering basic services still use analog meters. Regarding smart meter implementation in Peru, we find that only electricity companies are currently in the trial stage. And the most advanced implementation is using Power Line Communication (Wired Network). The water service is in the project stage and the gas service does not present information. We propose a module that takes a picture of the meter's counter, packages the data, and sends it over a LoRa Network to a Gateway. We implement a LoRa multi-packet protocol prototype for image transmission. The Multi-Packet protocol assigns bytes from the LoRa sub-packet to be the header of the packet, this header gives information to improve efficiency. Sending packets in batches improves energy consumption and time transmission because the sender does not have to wait for an ACK response. This work is the first step in a surveillance system, and gives information about image transmission using LoRa.},

  title={Human Inertial Thinking Strategy: A Novel Fuzzy Reasoning Mechanism for IoT-Assisted Visual Monitoring}, 
  year={2023},
  volume={10},
  number={5},
  pages={3735-3748},
  abstract={Computer vision has always been a hot field of research by contemporary scholars due to its wide range of applications. As an important branch of this field, the visual monitoring technology has shown superior vitality in the actual monitoring environment of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, when the monitoring environment is complex, once the target monitoring fails, the important information related to the target also disappears. At this time, if the existing monitoring method is used, the target cannot be monitored again. Moreover, the current filtering monitoring algorithm also has the problem of poor interpretability. Therefore, this article combines the relevant characteristics of human inertial thinking when dealing with such problems. First, our method screens the movement information of the target and introduces a fuzzy reasoning mechanism to infer the location area of the target through fuzzy thinking. Then, an alternative selection strategy based on the thinking set is applied, which alternates between the location of thinking reasoning and the location of memory to further obtain the effective visual monitoring of the target. The filtering and monitoring algorithm fused with the new mechanism in the OTB-2015 data set, the UVA123 data set, and the TC128 data set all show that the proposed fuzzy inference mechanism has good robustness and universality. Furthermore, our results confirm that it can not only ensure the monitoring speed and overall accuracy but also improve the stability of monitoring in the IoT-assisted monitoring environment, showing its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods. In addition, our results confirm that the integration of the proposed edge learning method with the IoT can be well applied to the construction of smart cities and future generation systems.},

  abstract={Civic hackathons gained momentum in the last years, mainly propelled by city halls and government agencies as a way to explore public data repositories. These initiatives became an attempt to crowdsource the development of software applications targeting government transparency and urban life, under the smart cities umbrella. Some authors have been criticizing the results of these competitions, complaining about the usefulness and quality of the software that is produced. However, academic literature has much anecdotal evidence on that, being scarce on empirical analysis of civic hackathons. Therefore, we intended to gather preliminary data not only to help verifying those claims but also to understand how teams in these competitions are tackling the different activities in their software development process, from requirements to application release and maintenance. In this work, we present preliminary results of these findings.},

  abstract={Emergency vehicles have been employed in rescue operations and supportive services, attending victims and managing critical situations in smart cities. Such vehicles, notably ambulances, fire trucks, police cars and transit agents vehicles, may be tracked and monitored in some applications for different functions. When such emergency vehicles are not equipped with GPS receivers, cameras can be used to view emergency signs printed on them, allowing indirect identification of emergency vehicles, although many complexities have to be considered when performing visual sensors-based tracking and monitoring. In this context, this paper proposes a mathematical model focused on the evaluation of the coverage efficiency of a group of visual sensors over moving vehicles, aimed at visual coverage of emergency signs. For that, vehicles, emergency signs and visual sensors are mathematically modelled in this paper, with coverage interactions among these elements being computed based on proposed geometry equations and algorithms. Doing so, the effectiveness of the positioning and configurations of visual sensors can be evaluated without requiring actual deployment, potentially reducing costs when assessing visual monitoring systems in this scenario.},

  abstract={Parking spaces are costly to build, parking payments are difficult to enforce, and drivers waste an excessive amount of time searching for empty lots. Accurate quantification would inform developers and municipalities in space allocation and design, while real-time measurements would provide drivers and parking enforcement with information that saves time and resources. In this paper, we propose an accurate and real-time video system for future Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cities applications. Using recent developments in deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) and a novel vehicle tracking filter, we combine information across multiple image frames in a video sequence to remove noise introduced by occlusions and detection failures. We demonstrate that our system achieves higher accuracy than pure image-based instance segmentation, and is comparable in performance to industry benchmark systems that utilize more expensive sensors, such as radar. Furthermore, our system shows significant potential in its scalability to a city-wide scale and also in the richness of its output that goes beyond traditional binary occupancy statistics.},

  abstract={The main objective of this study is to propose a cyber–physical system (CPS)-based person reidentification (P-ReID) framework for smart surveillance. The Internet of Things (IoT)-based interconnected vision sensors in smart cities are considered essential elements of a CPS, and contribute significantly to urban security. However, the reidentification of targeted persons using emerging edge AI techniques still faces certain challenges. To improve efficiency at the edge and overcome the traditional sensing of video cameras, we employed an AI-based P-ReID framework for CPS that is functional in IoT environments. In addition, we present dual attention dilated network (DADNet), which integrates an energy-efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) with a self-attention module to substantially improve the person matching probability. Furthermore, we applied dual feature fusion to intelligently integrate discriminative and robust features using early and late fusion strategies that allow DADNet to significantly consider the foreground and marginally utilize the background information. Furthermore, we impose diversity orthogonality regularization over several CNN layers, which boosts the performance of DADNet, resulting in an appropriate usage over IoT networks. A comprehensive set of ablation studies, comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches, and a time complexity analysis confirm the strength of our DADNet for reidentification tasks in AI-enabled IoT settings that are well suited for a CPS.},

  pages={672-677},
  abstract={In surveillance systems, vast amounts of data are collected from different sources to monitor ongoing video activities. Usually, video data is passively captured by visual sensors and forwarded to the command center, without intelligent Edge functionalities to select essential video information and locally detect abnormal events therein. These shortcomings often seen in practical surveillance scenarios lead to a wastage of storage resources and make data management, retrieval, and informed decision complex and time-consuming. Therefore, endowing visual sensors with video summarization capabilities is of utmost importance for smarter surveillance systems. This study departs from this rationale to propose an efficient neural networks-based video summarization method for surveillance systems. The proposed approach learns how to optimally segment a video by measuring informative features from the data flow, followed by memorability and entropy to maintain the relevance and diversity of the video summary produced on the Edge. Experimental results over benchmark datasets reveal that the proposed scheme outperforms other state-of-the-art counterparts and proves the effectiveness of our method for video summarization in smart cities.},

  abstract={Low-Power Wide-Area Networking (LPWAN) has become a key technology for connecting devices on the Internet-of-Things (IoT) context because of their long range and low-power capabilities. The LoRa (Long Range) modulation technique is getting more and more attention as a LPWAN for many application fields such as smart cities, smart industries, smart health and so on. In this way, evaluation of LoRa devices performance is needed to give support for new developments, mainly related to low-power applications. Although, there is a lack of studies about reducing the LoRa consumption, optimizing its parameters, which are important to the development of these applications, such as in energy harvesting systems. Then, in this work, some practical results of a LoRa-based node power consumption are shown aiming to compare energy consumption versus different LoRa parameter configurations for energy saving. In addition, a method for energy consumption optimization is introduced. Furthermore, the computed optimal values of the parameters Spreading Factor (SF), Bandwidth (BW) and Transmission Power (Ptx) for a sensor node that uses a SX1276 LoRa radio are also shown.},

  abstract={Smart cities should use computational systems to reduce human intervention in repetitive tasks as much as possible. Typically, solutions use adaptive applications to continuously and ubiquitously improve intelligent environments’ services, optimizing the use of resources such as electricity or water. This letter evaluates different machine learning algorithms to detect occupancy in smart spaces in the presence of anomalous readings. Additionally, it presents a low-cost wireless sensor network (WSN) to collect the data and give the occupancy inference. We collect the environment data, with the presented WSN, in our university's laboratory. To verify the robustness of algorithms, we randomly insert anomalous sensor readings in the collected data through a Bernoulli distribution process. These anomalies represent different environment events or sensor failures. With these data, we evaluate the random forest (RF), classification and regression tree (Cart), and K-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithms. The best performing algorithms were RF and k-NN, presenting close to 99% of accuracy in data without anomalies and 97% in data with 10% of anomalies. However, we observe an average execution time of 2.34 s to k-NN against 25.65 s to RF. Thus, considering our evaluated scenarios, we elect the k-NN as the best algorithm to detect occupation in smart spaces.},

  abstract={Due to the high mobility, dynamic nature, and legacy vehicular networks, the seamless connectivity and reliability become a new challenge in software-defined internet of vehicles based intelligent transportation systems (ITS). Thus, effieicnt optimization of the link with proper monitoring of the high speed of vehicles in ITS is very vital to promote the error-free and trustable platform. Key issues related to reliability, connectivity and stability optimization for vehicular networks are addressed. Thus, this study proposes a novel reliable connectivity framework by developing a stable, and scalable link optimization (SSLO) algorithm, state-of-the-art system model. In addition, a Use-case of smart city with stable and reliable connectivity is proposed by examining the importance of vehicular networks. The numerical experimental results are extracted from software defined-Internet of Vehicle (SD-IoV) platform which shows high stability and reliability of the proposed SSLO under different test scenarios, such as vehicle to vehicle (V2V), vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle to anything (V2X). The proposed SSLO and Baseline algorithms are compared in terms of performance metrics e.g. packet loss ratio, transmission power (i.e., stability), average throughput, and average delay transfer. Finally, the validated results reveal that SSLO algorithm optimizes connectivity (95%), energy efficiency (67%), throughput (4Kbps) and delay (3 sec).},

  abstract={A new era of automated services has permeated user's daily lives thanks to paradigms such as Smart City and the Internet of Things. This shift from traditional applications is possible due to the massive amount of heterogeneous devices that constitute the Internet of Things. To provide newly improved characteristics to these services, such as mobility support, high resilience, and low latency, an extension to the Cloud computing paradigm was created, called Fog computing, which brings processing and storage resources towards the edge of the network, in the vicinity of the Internet of Things environment. This scenario implies a higher complexity level needed to coordinate available resources and how applications and services use them. Although some solutions have been proposed for the Cloud, several characteristics differentiate the Cloud from the Fog, creating the need for new mechanisms for the coordination of resources, applications, and services in the Fog. This paper explains the challenges present in the Fog that call for new mechanisms to later propose an architecture to manage resources in the Fog using a hybrid approach. In the Internet of Things and South-Bound Fog Levels, a distributed management of applications and services is proposed applying choreography techniques to enable automated fast decision making. A centralized approach to orchestrate applications and services taking advantage of a global knowledge of the resources available in the network is suggested for the North-Bound Fog and Cloud Levels.},

To tackle this challenge, we develop GeoGuide, an interactive guidance approach for spatial data.

  abstract={In recent years, there is a growing research interest in smart city applications based on opportunistic communications. The opportunistic networks in these scenarios are composed of disconnections, network partitions, high delay and strong influence of human mobility. To cope with these challenges, social-inspired approaches have been proposed considering the structure of networks and personal user features, however, limited studies have explored temporal variations of features and influence of exogenous variables, disregarding adaptive forwarding policies recommended for dynamic scenarios. In this paper, we address these challenges while investigating both, the temperature and the season calendar, as environmental features able to model the behavior of users' mobility and peer contacts. The results showed distinct social and spatiotemporal features characterized by thermal conditions able to affect the network performance. We also identified critical points of temperature able to provide early signals about the network changes. Finally, our results indicate that environmental data are crucial information towards the design of the next generation opportunistic mobile networks.},

  abstract={Internet of Drones (IoD) is an architecture that aims to enable different drones to share the same airspace. This architecture can help coordinate drone access to airspace in urban environments. Considering that the IoD is a dynamic network, it is possible to have scenarios in which drone traffic is sparse when, for instance, the network has isolated drones. In this case, the drones’ communication range does not reach any other drone. Thus, store-carry-forward protocols may be suitable for maintaining network communication. Moreover, different networks can collaborate to fill these communication gaps. In this study, we explore the collaboration between IoD and Bus Networks. Our analysis shows that maintaining a hybrid communication between drones and buses can fill the gaps in the communication between drones. The main goal of this work is to present the IoDSCF – a store-carry-forward routing protocol for joint Bus Networks and the Internet of Drones (IoD). IoDSCF takes advantage of both networks to extend the communication reachability. Our results reveal that IoDSCF presents better results in the number of delivered packets and end-to-end delay than a solution based only on communication between drones. This is a promising strategy for data communication, mainly in smart cities.},

  abstract={Many technological areas have been affected by the appearance of the internet of Things (IoT). This phenomenon is happening because applications such as smart cities, smart grids, smart buildings, smart homes, industry, transportation, healthcare and surveillance are being adapted to a new paradigm for adaptability, modularity, heterogeneity, scalability, optimization and decentralization. In this sense, several IoT architectures are being proposed for the applications that are inserted in this new technological development, with the most recent approaches being based on the Software Defined Network (SDN). Therefore, to follow this technological development, there is a need to implement the applications of control systems in this new scenario, which imposes challenges to be overcome, such as nondeterministic networks, latency, jitter, bandwidth, packet loss and interoperability. The focus of this work is on how to combine Distributed Networked Control Systems (DNCS) and IoT to meet this new technological context. However, the first step to be taken is to define the topology of IoT-based Networked Control Systems (IoT-DNCS), then develop a suitable system architecture to make control systems via the Internet of Things possible. Therefore, this article aims to propose a problem formulation and a simple and general architecture for IoT-DNCS, specifying the function of each element of the system according to the topology of the problem, and the organization of them to implement the control loops between sensors, controllers and actuators. The architecture proposed in this paper serves as a starting point for studies on new strategies and structures for network and feedback control systems.},

  abstract={Digital technologies are changing the way people interact with the world. The Digital Twin (DT) is one of the key enablers of Industry 4.0. It provides a virtual representation of an observable element of the real world. These elements can be both physical objects such as devices or non-physical such as interactions and processes. Digitalization of the real world enables new business models, transforming traditional products into services, as for instance, the Car-as-a-Service (CaaS). To integrate all components that will be part of systems like CaaS or Smart Cities, it is necessary to have well-defined standards for modeling and defining an architecture especially taking into consideration the granularity level of the system. This paper proposes the main components needed for building DT-based systems with different levels of granularity. These components have been arranged in layers to specify the concerns of each part of the system. A case study has been developed to demonstrate the modeling and the deployment of the Digital Twin, highlighting how this concept can be one of the key enablers for CaaS.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm aims to bring continuous interaction between small embedded devices and humans. The IoT has the potential to affect our daily lives and bring many benefits to society. Low-Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWAN) is a new IoT technology that offers long distance connectivity for a massive number of devices. LPWAN is a promising solution to enable complex IoT scenarios, such as smart cities and smart healthcare. LoRa is currently one of the leading LPWAN solutions available for public use. Due to the great number of connected devices and, in some cases, sensitive data transmitted in IoT networks, security is one of the main concerns in LPWAN. In this paper, we focus on the issues of key management in LoRaWAN. We propose a secure architecture for key management based on private blockchain and smart contracts in order to increase the levels of security and availability in LoRaWAN environments. In order to show the feasibility of the proposed architecture, a working prototype was implemented using open-source tools and commodity hardware.},

  pages={181553-181569},
  abstract={Sound Event Localization and Detection (SELD) is a critical challenge in various industrial applications, such as autonomous systems, smart cities, and audio surveillance, which require accurate identification and localization of sound events in complex environments. Traditional supervised approaches heavily rely on large, annotated multichannel audio datasets, which are expensive and time-consuming to produce. This paper addresses this limitation by introducing the w2v-SELD architecture, a self-supervised model adapted from the wav2vec 2.0 framework to learn effective sound event representations directly from raw, unlabeled 3D audio data in ambisonics format. The proposed model follows a two-stage process: pre-training on large, unlabeled 3D audio datasets to capture high-level features, followed by fine-tuning with a smaller, labeled SELD dataset. Experimental results show that our w2v-SELD method outperforms baseline models on Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes and Events (DCASE) challenges, achieving a 66% improvement for DCASE TAU-2019 and a 57% improvement on DCASE TAU-2020 with respect to baseline systems. The w2v-SELD model performs competitively with state-of-the-art supervised methods, highlighting its potential to significantly reduce the dependency on labeled data in industrial SELD applications. The code and pre-trained parameters of our w2v-SELD model are available online.},

  abstract={Smart Cities is a world-wide initiative leading to better exploit the resources in a city in order to offer higher level services to people. In this context, urban computing is a process of acquisition, integration, and analysis of big and heterogeneous data generated by a diversity of sources in urban spaces, such as sensors, traffic devices, vehicles, buildings, and humans, to tackle the major issues that cities face, e.g. air pollution, increased energy consumption and traffic congestion. The majority of these information can be represented as graphs, such as the transportation network, in which places (nodes) are connected by some form of public transportation (edges). A vision of the "city of the future", or even the city of the present, rests on the integration of science and technology through information systems. This vision requires a re-thinking of the relationships between technology, government, city managers, business, academia and the research community. This position paper presents our views towards developing techniques for querying and evolving graph-modeled datasets based on user-defined constraints. Our focus is to show how these techniques can be applied to effectively retrieve urban data and have automated mechanisms that guarantee data consistency.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm can improve a broad range of applications, such as medical sensors, smart cities, industrial monitoring, and so on. In healthcare specifically, these devices can aid in management tasks and improve the quality of life of patients in intensive care. However, securing medical IoT devices and its data is a crucial task. Not only do they handle Electronic Medical Records (EMR) and physiological information, but in some cases, disruption can affect a patient's treatment. Blockchain technologies applied in the healthcare context can provide privacy, immutability, decentralization, and easier access and sharing of medical data. Despite the emergence of applications aiming to solve security issues in the Healthcare IoT (HIoT) scenario using blockchain, there is still much to be addressed, mainly regarding throughput, storage of data, and efficient use of resources. This work proposes a blockchain-based storage architecture for HIoT, using a private network and distributed data storage to achieve integrity, accountability, and availability of medical data.},

  abstract={With so many resource-constrained objects (“things”) interacting autonomously in Internet of Things (IoT) solutions, the surrounding environment becomes smarter. A software, called middleware, plays a key role as it is responsible for most of the intelligence in IoT, acting as a “brain”, integrating data from devices, allowing them to communicate, and making decisions based on collected data. By nature, smart environments are heterogeneous, considering the plethora of available technologies, and middleware can thrive, playing even a more relevant role in large environments, such as smart cities. This paper explores the differences between connecting conventional and IoT devices to the Internet, while highlights the theoretically ideal operation of IoT middleware modules. Then, in order evaluate the performance comparison and rank this type of platforms across different scenarios, quantitative and qualitative metrics are proposed and detailed described.},

Although motivated by a research on how tight such parameters should be in a Fifth generation environment, the present study applies also to former networks generations, providing a framework of practical measures to handle a growing traffic close to or greater than nominal cell capacity, and, consequently, in this sense it may constitute a useful contribution to network management methods. The simulation model was built following a methodology to assure increasing conceptual model validation.},

  abstract={Fully-unsupervised Person and Vehicle Re-Identification have received increasing attention due to their broad applicability in areas such as surveillance, forensics, event understanding, and smart cities, without requiring any manual annotation. However, most of the prior art has been evaluated in datasets that have just a couple thousand samples. Such small-data setups often allow the use of costly techniques in terms of time and memory footprints, such as Re-Ranking, to improve clustering results. Moreover, some previous work even pre-selects the best clustering hyper-parameters for each dataset, which is unrealistic in a large-scale fully-unsupervised scenario. In this context, this work tackles a more realistic scenario and proposes two strategies to learn from large-scale unlabeled data. The first strategy performs a local neighborhood sampling to reduce the dataset size in each iteration without violating neighborhood relationships. A second strategy leverages a novel Re-Ranking technique, which has a lower time upper bound complexity and reduces the memory complexity from  $\mathcal {O}(n^{2})$  to  $\mathcal {O}(kn)$  with  $k \ll n$ . To avoid the need for pre-selection of specific hyper-parameter values for the clustering algorithm, we also present a novel scheduling algorithm that adjusts the density parameter during training, to leverage the diversity of samples and keep the learning robust to noisy labeling. Finally, due to the complementary knowledge learned by different models in an ensemble, we also introduce a co-training strategy that relies upon the permutation of predicted pseudo-labels, among the backbones, with no need for any hyper-parameters or weighting optimization. The proposed methodology outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in well-known benchmarks and in the challenging large-scale Veri-Wild dataset, with a faster and memory-efficient Re-Ranking strategy, and a large-scale, noisy-robust, and ensemble-based learning approach.},

  abstract={The adoption of multi-sensor hardware units to detect different types of emergencies in complex scenarios such as Industry 4.0 and Smart Cities is a recent development trend, which have demanded research efforts to optimize the way these units are assembled, configured, and deployed. However, although their expected advantages, usual multi-sensors emergency-oriented approaches may be constrained by the tight association between physical sensor devices and the emergency detection process. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative approach to concurrently detect multiple emergencies exploiting the concept of soft-sensor modules, which are implemented on Emergency Detection Units (EDUs) as concurrent tasks along with a high-priority emergency alerting task. The soft-sensor concept defines physical sensors as ordinary input data streams, which will be processed according to the defined algorithms by each particular soft-sensor, allowing detection decisions to be performed on the edge. In order to support the practical exploitation of this concept, a formal specification based on Petri Nets is defined, modeling the concurrent operation of the tasks within an EDU. A proof of concept is also designed based on the affordable Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller, demonstrating how the proposed approach would behave when two soft-sensors are implemented in a typical detection unit.},

  abstract={Summary <p>Internet of things (IoT)[1] applications are wide spreading, recently empowered by the dissemination of technologies like smart cities, autonomous vehicles, smart grids, industry 4.0, home automation, wearables, etc. On the other hand, the global warming and climate crisis demand urgent, bold actions toward energy&#x2010;efficient (EE) technologies for telecommunication systems, which are responsible for a significant part of global energy consumption. To this end, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) appear as an important technology to improve the propagation channel gain at the expense of very little power expenditures, recognized as a key element in achieving green telecommunication systems. In this chapter, we focus on the EE uplink (UL) transmission of massive multiple&#x2010;input multiple&#x2010;output (M&#x2010;MIMO) IoT systems aided by an RIS. We propose and evaluate different schemes to minimize the total UL transmit power by optimizing the transmit power of IoT devices, the RIS phase&#x2010;shift element, and the combining matrix at the base station (BS). Particularly, we give special attention to manifold optimization techniques, which are well suited to the RIS phase&#x2010;shifts optimization problem. Herein, we treat jointly via iterative alternating optimization (i&#x2010;AO) approach the three optimization variables: RIS phase&#x2010;shift vector; BS combining matrix, and unit terminal (UT) power allocation vector. Extensive numerical results are provided and discussed, revealing that the proposed conjugate gradient (CG) method based on Riemannian manifold (RM) with the zero&#x2010;forcing (ZF) combining achieves the highest power savings, being able to reduce the UL transmit power by up to 89% under typical operation conditions scenarios in comparison with conventional systems without RIS.</p>},

  abstract={We consider the design of distributed algorithms that govern the manner in which agents contribute to a social sensing platform. Specifically, we are interested in situations, where fairness among the agents contributing to the platform is needed. A notable example is the platforms operated by public bodies, where fairness is a legal requirement. The design of such distributed systems is challenging due to the fact that we wish to simultaneously realize an efficient social sensing platform but also deliver a predefined quality of service to the agents (for example, a fair opportunity to contribute to the platform). In this article, we introduce iterated function systems (IFSs) as a tool for the design and analysis of systems of this kind. We show how the IFS framework can be used to realize systems that deliver a predictable quality of service to agents, can be used to underpin contracts governing the interaction of agents with the social sensing platform, and which are efficient. To illustrate our design via a use case, we consider a large, high-density network of participating parked vehicles. When awoken by an administrative center, this network proceeds to search for moving missing entities of interest using RFID-based techniques. We regulate which vehicles are actively searching for the moving entity of interest at any point in time. In doing so, we seek to equalize vehicular energy consumption across the network. This is illustrated through simulations of a search for a missing Alzheimer’s patient in Melbourne, Australia. The experimental results are presented to illustrate the efficacy of our system and the predictability of access of agents to the platform independent of initial conditions.},

Therefore, we designed (i) a Data Fusion on Intelligent Transportation Systems (DataFITS) framework that allows collecting data from numerous sources and fusing them according to spatial and temporal criteria; (ii) a traffic estimation method that groups road segments into regions, identify correlations between them, and measure the traffic distribution to estimate traffic. As a result, DataFITS increased by 130% the number of road segments coverage and enhanced, by fusion process, around 35% of road overlapping data sources. We evaluate the traffic estimation of the 15 most correlated regions, where the fused data together with correlated areas resulted in the best traffic estimation accuracy by reaching up to 40% in some cases and 9% on average.},

  abstract={Internet of Drones (IoD) technologies are often associated with unique swarms of drones or individual drone applications.

Furthermore, there could be no Internet of Drones (IoD)without reliable and efficient drone coordination in the airspace. This necessity makes IoD an architecture responsible for managing dronecommunication and mobility. The airspace organization is crucial in combining IoD and Terrestrial Networks in a smart city scenario, asintelligent drone positioning can promote and facilitate integration with networks on the ground.

  abstract={The prevalence of fires in modern urban landscapes continues to be reported as a significant challenge due to their potential negative consequences. This enduring threat heightened by climate changes necessitates the development of innovative approaches for early detection, incorporating a variety of sensor-based technologies across diverse scopes. Although effective, traditional detection methods based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or camera sensors often encounter cost, scalability, and deployment limitations, particularly for vast areas to be covered. On the other hand, scalar sensors for threshold-based fire detection are limited to the context and require proper calibration for different scenarios. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing a novel approach that leverages a sensor-based decision tree model for fire and smoke detection using micro Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The core of this approach lies in developing an efficient, lightweight model suited for extreme edge devices, where performance and energy efficiency are critical. We validated our model using a public dataset, demonstrating its potential effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

  abstract={Smart Cities services and applications can generate massive amounts of data to be processed in real-time, including the ones regarding moving objects. The ability to handle fast streams of data, especially detecting movements of groups of objects, is of paramount importance for the advance of such services. In this paper, we address the challenge of scalability for real-time detection trajectories of flocks, in the context of smart cities. The Bitmap Disk Filtering (BitDF) is an scalable algorithm capable of handling large-scale datasets. Performance evaluation results shows that, when compared to the current state-of-the- art algorithm, BitDF can reduce 99% of the processing time while not affecting accuracy. We prove the efficiency of BitDF by performing evaluation with both real and synthetic large datasets. BitDF is then very suitable to meet the requirements of real-time applications for a variety of trajectory-based applications.},

  abstract={Analyzing surveillance videos is mandatory for the public and industrial security. Overwhelming growth in computer vision fields has been made to automate the surveillance system in terms of human activity recognition, such as behavior analysis and violence detection (VD). However, it is challenging to detect and analyze the violent scenes intelligently to fulfill the notion of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)-based surveillance buoyed by constrained resources to reduce computational power. To tackle this challenge, in this article, an artificial intelligence enabled IIoT-based framework with VD-Network (VD-Net) is proposed. First, the input video frames are passed to light-weight convolutional neural network model for important information collection including humans or suspicious objects such as knives/guns. Upon suspicious object detection, an alert is generated as an earlier VD in IIoT network while the information is shared with concern departments. Only the frames with objects are forwarded to cloud for detail investigation where features are extracted using convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM). The latter from ConvLSTM is propagated to gated recurrent unit for final VD. The conducted experiments and ablation study on the existing surveillance and nonsurveillance datasets empirically validate the effectiveness of the proposed VD-Net by improving 3.9% increase in the accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art VD methods.},

  abstract={LoRa has emerged as a prominent technology for the Internet of Things (IoT), with LoRa Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) emerging as a suitable connection solution for smart things. The choice of the best location for the installation of gateways, as well as a robust network server configuration, are key to the deployment of a LoRaWAN. In this paper, we present an evaluation of Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) values collected from the real-life LoRaWAN deployed in Skellefteå, Sweden, when compared with the values calculated by a Radio Frequency (RF) planning tool for the Irregular Terrain Model (ITM), Irregular Terrain with Obstructions Model (ITWOM) and Okumura-Hata propagation models. Five sensors are configured and deployed along a wooden bridge, with different Spreading Factors (SFs), such as SF 7, 10 and 12. Our results show that the RSSI values calculated using the RF planning tool for ITWOM are closest to the values obtained from the real-life LoRaWAN. Moreover, we also show evidence that the choice of a propagation model in an RF planning tool has to be made with care, mainly due to the terrain conditions of the area where the network and the sensors are deployed.},

However the use of a centralized controller increases WSN traffic, decreasing its lifetime. The SDN controller could leverage from the WSN local knowledge to improve the decisions taken. We propose an architecture with distributed and hierarchical controllers, where local controllers use local information to reply to nodes in its area, and a global controller oversees the whole network.

  abstract={Agent-based Internet of Things (IoT) applications have recently emerged as applications that can involve sensors, wireless devices, machines and software that can exchange data and be accessed remotely. Such applications have been proposed in several domains including health care, smart cities and agriculture. However, despite their increased adoption, deploying these applications in specific settings has been very challenging because of the complex static and dynamic variability of the physical devices such as sensors and actuators, the software application behavior and the environment in which the application is embedded. In this paper, we propose a modeling approach for IoT analytics based on learning embodied agents (i.e. situated agents). The approach involves: (i) a variability model of IoT embodied agents; (ii) feedback evaluative machine learning; and (iii) reconfiguration of a group of agents in accordance with environmental context. The proposed approach advances the state of the art in that it facilitates the development of Agent-based IoT applications by explicitly capturing their complex and dynamic variabilities and supporting their self-configuration based on an context-aware and machine learning-based approach.},

  abstract={The internet of things (IoT) currently has a large range of applications, from wearable to smart cities. Many of these applications require that the nodes inside the networks know their relative or absolute position. To this end, multiple positioning methods can be applied, among such methods are Global Positioning Systems (GPS) or methods that employ time delay of arrival (TDOA). This work presents node localization methods that employ a dual polarization receiver on a single node, or a virtual array when multiple nodes are capable of cooperating. The proposed approaches aim to minimize the economic cost associated with implementing localization methods, and can be done with simple hardware. The accuracy of the proposed methods is measured trough a set of numerical simulations.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) is believed to bring new unprecedented development to our society and will impact and enable new, more powerful applications in many areas. When considering Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), there is potential to enhance applications in emergency response situations, smart cities, industry and others. UAVs are expected to provide and consume services as one of the things in the IoT environment. However, the intrinsic IoT heterogeneity regarding devices, platforms, and communication protocols makes the task of service provision and management much harder to be done in the application layer. In previous work, we have presented how HAMSTER can enable secure service provision using the Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) protocol with enhanced security. In this paper, we show how HAMSTER deals with service management and exchange with minimum effort from the application. We introduce the Service Exchange Operator (SEO) in HAMSTER and present preliminary results. Keywords - Drone, UAV, IoT, Services, HAMSTER.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things has become a comprehensive concept used in different contexts (e.g., smart cities, security, and education). In particular, in education, a vast literature has used the Internet of Things to promote smart education. However, there is still no overview of how the Internet of Things has been used to promote smart education. We addressed this challenge by conducting a systematic literature review on the use of the Internet of Things to promote smart education. Through a systematic literature review, we answered the following research questions: i) Which smart objects collect data from the physical world? ii) What types of information are collected? And, iii) what are the goals of collecting this data? Our analysis reveals that i) the most common smart objects in educational environments include sensors, cameras, ID tags, and wearable devices; ii) these devices collect data in twelve main categories, which include everything from microclimatic information to details of the emotional and behavioral state of the actors involved; iii) the purpose of this collection is to provide a more effective and personalized educational experience to individual needs. Our findings play a crucial role in educational technologies, establishing a foundation for future research endeavors and providing valuable insights into the use of the Internet of Things to promote smart education.},

  abstract={The rise of distributed sensors-based monitoring applications has allowed the gathering of important information in urban areas, strongly supporting the maturation of smart cities. In those scenarios, alternative transportation has been leveraged as viable solutions for the complex challenges of urban mobility, bringing cycling to a new setting. Actually, when assessing the quality of cycling paths, safety and quality parameters can be retrieved from distributed sensor nodes attached to bikes, allowing better perceptions of the adverse conditions faced by cyclists in modern cities. However, such IoT-based procedures require proper modelling of cycling paths, since quality parameters are expected to have spatiotemporal significance. Therefore, this paper discusses and proposes solutions for some important modelling and visualization issues related to the quality monitoring of cycle paths. Such solutions are concerned with the mathematical modelling of this problem, as well as the proposal of a generic computer-assisted solution to handle environmental parameters retrieved by sensors attached to bikes. Doing so, it is defined a uniform representation model and an expected data flow that can be exploited by any monitoring application in urban areas. As an important step in that direction, a reference implementation is described, allowing formal representation, structured processing and graphical visualization of bike-centric monitoring parameters, potentially supporting new developments in the area of smart cycling.},

In addition, mesoscale models of weather forecasting can contribute to short-term decision-making by public managers. Thus, this work presents an analysis of the impact of green roofs in Chilean Mediterranean cities, with this modeling tool, on meteorological variables. These cities are considered small and medium-sized. The results shows that the green roof reduces the temperature in Talca by up 1.28 °C, while the coastal city of Concepción decreases up to 0.1 °C. The turbulent kinect energy also reduces with the presence of vegetated roof compared with conventional roofs, influencing in the dispersion of pollutants. In general, the intensive use of green roofs in clusters of small cities can act as moisture and heat suppliers due to the advection effect, thus contributing to mitigating heat island effects.},

  pages={1-9},
  abstract={Recently, Network Slicing in Radio Access Technologies (RATs) has been proposed as an approach to divide the wireless network infrastructure into isolated logical slices which are defined following their requirements and features in a service-driven way. To the best of our knowledge, the application of Network Slicing has not been explored in IEEE 802.11ah Networks. In this work, we propose a Virtual Network Slicing Broker (VNSB), a Virtual Network Function (VNF) instantiated inside a Software Defined Network (SDN) controller which communicates with an IEEE 802.11ah network Access Point (AP) via a southbound Application Program Interface (API). Based on information obtained by the northbound API, the slicing broker gets the information contained in the slicing templates, which describes the services features and respective Quality of Service (QoS) restrictions. With these data, the slicing broker makes logical slices in the context of the Restricted Access Windows (RAW) which are periodically sent by the AP to the stations (STA) via the Raw Parameter Set (RPS). Since there is no hardware with the IEEE 802.11ah standard available on the market, we validate the proposed solution through extensive simulations in a typical smart city scenario. Results showed the broker capacity to build and manage logical slices per service, respecting the QoS restrictions of each offered service. Moreover, the proposed slicing broker makes use of available resources of neighbor slices reducing delay, packet loss, and efficiently maximizing throughput per slice.},

  abstract={Bike share systems have been implemented in many cities to provide an alternative low-cost environmentally friendly and healthy public transportation. Citizens can pick up and drop off bikes among stations around the city. The system may be used for both work-related and leisure purposes including supporting last-mile transportation and tourism. In order to sustain and attract more users into the bike system, understanding demand and trip patterns is a key objective. Further, due to the asymmetric and dynamic nature of user demands, some stations tend to run out of bikes whereas other stations tend to be full (impeding returns). Rebalancing stations to provide high quality services to fit pick up and drop off demand is a major challenge in bike share systems. In this paper, we present a three-layer SMARTBIKE system to assist city administrators in Fortaleza, Brazil with bike share system decision making. This is an international cooperative effort between academia and government to aid in building a Smart City. The first layer of the proposed tool includes ¿-means clustering technology to understand the true demand of the city bike share system. We designed a novel station network analysis in the second layer to provide insights on system usage patterns and to help with the rebalancing strategy. The third layer provides rebalancing support at the facility and operation level. Finally, we discuss a dynamic visualization tool to support decision making.},

  abstract={Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning (ML) that focuses on the development of artificial intelligence. It is also often referred to by its acronym, DL (AI). This technique lays an emphasis on the use of big capacity, scalable models that are able to construct distributed representations depending on the input data set. This proposed illustrates the generalizability of these methods and the usage of them in a broad range of cyber security investigations that are peculiar to their environment. The neural network models have been continuously refined and extended during the whole of this research in order to achieve greater adaptability. The following is a list of the important contributions that this proposed makes, in order from most significant to least significant: Work is currently being done to create a comprehensive database for the identification of domain names that have been generated by a domain generation algorithm (DGA), as well as a one-of-a-kind architecture that will increase the overall effectiveness of DGA domain name detection. Both of these will help increase overall efficiency. The creation of a hybrid intrusion detection warning system that is founded on a deep neural network (DNN) and that has the capability to monitor network and host-level activities inside an Ethernet local area network (LAN) (LAN). The examination of information gathered from social media platforms, electronic mail (email), and uniform resource locators in order to design a unified, DL-based framework for the detection of spam and phishing (URL). The creation of a technique based on DL for the study of secure shell (SSH) traffic, the categorization of application network traffic, the classification of malicious traffic, and the detection of harmful traffic is being worked on. The name of the new framework that has been suggested, which is called ScaleMalNet, reflects how hybrid and scalable it is. In the first stage, the executables file is classified as malware or genuine by using static and dynamic analysis. In the second stage, the malicious executables _le are grouped into corresponding malware families. This is a two-step process. For the aim of conducting investigations into Android ransomware and malware, an analogous hybrid DL framework is now in the process of being developed. This framework is better in its capacity to detect dangerous software and ransomware on Android when compared to the typical ML-based techniques that are presently in use. These approaches are already in widespread usage. The development of a framework for DNS-based botnet detection and DL-based network intrusion detection is now being worked on in the context of the Internet of things (IoT) and smart cities},

CNNs are today fundamental not only for autonomous vehicles, but also for Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cities or smart homes. Vendors are developing low-power, efficient, and low-cost dedicated accelerators to allow the execution of the computational-demanding CNNs even in embedded applications with strict power and cost budgets. Google's Coral Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) is one of the latest low power accelerators for CNNs. In this paper we investigate the reliability of TPUs to atmospheric neutrons, reporting experimental data equivalent to more than 30 million years of natural irradiation. We analyze the behavior of TPUs executing atomic operations (standard or depthwise convolutions) with increasing input sizes as well as eight CNN designs typical of embedded applications, including transfer learning and reduced data-set configurations. We found that, despite the high error rate, most neutrons-induced errors only slightly modify the convolution output and do not change the CNNs detection or classification. By reporting details about the fault model and error rate, we provide valuable information on how to evaluate and improve the reliability of CNNs executed on a TPU.},

  abstract={Wireless visual sensor networks are commonly employed on several applications contexts such as smart cities, intelligent transportation systems and industrial management, aiming at the use of visual data from cameras to provide enhanced information and to expand the networks utilities. In these scenarios, some applications may require high-definition images when performing more specialized tasks, for example in face and text recognition, adding an important monitoring requirement when using camera-based sensors. In fact, it is important to ensure that the network is able to gather visual data with the associated required quality to each task, and such perceived quality may be processed as a function of the Field of View (FoV) of the visual sensors. In order to address this issue, new quality metrics are proposed for wireless visual sensor networks that are deployed to perform area coverage, exploiting for that different perceptions of the FoV. Those metrics are proposed along with redeployment optimization methods for visual sensor nodes aiming at the improvement of the perceived monitoring quality, which are based on greedy and evolutionary-based approaches. The proposed metrics and algorithms are expected to be more realistic than previous solutions, allowing flexible processing of variables as cameras' positions, orientations and viewing angles, providing then high flexibility on the definition of parameters and significantly contributing to the development of sensor networks based on visual sensors.},

  abstract={The integration of Cloud Computing and Internet of Things (IoT) is foreseen as an enabler to suit a plethora of novel latency critical applications (e.g, e-health, intelligent transportation, safety, energy, smart cities, and many others). These applications require multimedia (mainly video) flows to be handled by the underlying network in an efficient and scalable way, as they expect to consume a massive data produced by billions of things. In view of this, we propose a dynamic multiuser session control plane which leverages 5G's support of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) substrate to advance beyond todays limited, per-flow IP-based communication systems. We handle such limitations by proposing CLASSICO, a Cross-LAyer Sdn SessIon COntrol architecture that exploits SDN to offload the flow streaming computation operations from the IoT cloud platform to the network edge, affording high timeliness and scalability for the IoT-cloudified system. CLASSICO dynamically builds Application Layer multiuser data sessions and maps them into enhanced group-enabled data paths featuring SDN replication at branching nodes. We applied our solution to multimedia-alike use case, and results show that CLASSICO outperforms typical SDN-enabled IoT systems in terms to Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) video metrics.},

  abstract={Ensuring data privacy and integrity is imperative in wireless connection. Sensitive information needs to be transmitted through long-distance areas in many scenarios as healthcare, agricultural production and smart cities. Not only security, but also performance in this particular type of communication is not a trivial match. The LoRaWAN protocol is capable of transmitting data between IoT as end devices to application servers where the data can be analyzed and stored. The protocol offers a significant security standard and a recognized performance in long-range communication at low cost. However, the advances in Quantum Computing also bring threats to the current state of cryptographic algorithms, possibly compromising communication privacy. LoRaWAN’s security is based on AES-128 cryptographic algorithm, which is not safe to quantum computers. Thus, this work proposes an enhancement in LoraWAN’s security protocol adding the Kyber KEM-1024 algorithm to reinforce the protocol against quantum-computing attacks. The implementation successfully simulated the communication between an end device and an application server performing the post-quantum algorithm KEM-1024. Despite the results for time of execution can be improved, the proposal presented a safe communication resistant to quantum-computing attacks.},

Thus, based on the technological development of the Internet of Things (IoT) focused on the concept of smart cities, this paper aims to describe and model some relevant factors related to traffic accidents, and promote the visualization of their impact on the bus routes of São Paulo city. The time window considered was February 2016, 2017, and 2018. By means of information visualization techniques, we describe the location of accidents across São Paulo region and later associate important factors (such as climate and radar) to the occurrence of traffic jams. Subsequently, a spatial study is conducted to visualize the bus routes and observe possible transit bottlenecks. As result, we deploy a visualization tool named SmartViz Traffic to emphasize the importance of monitoring accidents, aiming prevention and road safety, as well to inform the traffic dynamic in São Paulo city.},

  abstract={N OWADAYS, billions of devices are connected to the In-ternet, enabling Internet of Things (IoT) systems widely deployed, such as smart city, smart healthcare and intelligent plant, to capture a great quantity of sensing data. Consequently, the data transmission, processing and analysis in IoT applications bring a great pressure to the central server. Fortunately, distributed intelligence becomes one of the potential solutions. Distributed intelligence can greatly relieve server pressures via plenty of terminal devices, and these devices collaboratively perceive and handle the mass data to improve the reliability, s-calability and security of industrial IoT systems. As future IoT system will embrace more wireless sensors and devices, the high-performance computing, high-bandwidth and low-latency communication are excessively required, many new research opportunities and challenges for distributed intelligence over Internet of things have arisen. To promote the development of distributed intelligence technology, this special section (SS) focuses on various technologies and platforms regarding industrial IoT systems. This special section received nearly 50 submitted manuscripts, out of which 10 of them have been accepted after a rigorous peer review. Each manuscript is reviewed by multiple rounds of review with at least three or four reviewers, the problems to be solved and the innovation of each manuscript are mainly concerned. Then the accepted papers are summarized as follows in details. Considering the joint optimization of the offloading decision and resource allocation under limited resource constraints in collaborative edge computing networks with multiple IIoT devices and MEC servers, an improved differential evolution algorithm [7] is proposed to minimize the weighted sum of cost of energy consumption and time delay, which can effectively reduce the system delay and energy consumption. In order to improve the performance of task scheduling in cloud computing, Attiya et al. [1] propose a novel hybrid swarm intelligence method MRFOSSA, which uses a modified Manta-Ray Foraging Optimizer (MRFO) and the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA). MRFOSSA is superior to other methods in terms of makespan time and cloud throughput. The research goal of the paper [5] is to design an intelligent computing offloading strategy for industrial applications in order to optimize costs and mitigate energy losses. Then the paper proposes to combine a fog controller and AI-based learning techniques so that the fog controller can intelligently assign tasks to the most appropriate fog devices and find the appropriate path to the target. Considering the resource utilization efficiency under dynamic overload requests and network states in IIoT, Chen et al. [2] propose DRL-based intelligent SFC orchestration scheme and jointly optimize the VNF deployment and SFC embedment by the improved DDQN algorithm, which can improve the performance of resource utilization rate, execution cost and delay compared with other representative schemes. To solve the problem of resource allocation and energy cost in Internet of Vehicles, Kong et al. [8] design a joint computing and caching framework and formulate the problem as a reinforcement learning problem to minimize the energy cost. On this basis, the optimization algorithm based on DDPG is proposed, which can effectively decrease energy costs. To reduce the query numbers of the object model when constructing adversarial examples, Zhang et al. [10] propose generating adversarial examples with shadow model (GASM), i.e., transfering the query operations to the designed shadow model, which can achieve high attack success rates. Chen et al. [3] revise a Decentralized-Wireless-Federated-Learning algorithm (DWFL) which utilizes the superposition property of the analog scheme. It can solve the problem of single failure, limited bandwidth resource and privacy protection in wireless federated learning algorithm, which can be applied widely in wireless IoT networks. To reduce the resource consumption in CNN-based applications, Jia et al. [6] propose the CNN-based Resource Optimization APProach which utilizes model compression and computation sharing to optimize inner-model and inter-model respectively, and the comparison results show the superior performance in scalability and the decrease of resource cost. In mobile crowdsensing activities, Gao et al. [4] propose a differential Location Privacy-preserving Mechanism based on Trajectory obfuscation (LPMT) to protect the location privacy of mobile users, which includes three operations: stay points extraction, stay points obfuscation and stay points sampling. In order to mimic the task-free bottom-up visual attention process by predicting salient regions on natural images, Umer et al. [9] propose a Pseudo Knowledge Distillation (PKD) model based on knowledge distillation and pseudo labelling technique, which is computationally efficient and suitable for real-time on-device saliency prediction.},

  abstract={Extracting knowledge from unstructured data silos, a legacy of old applications, is mandatory for improving the governance of today’s cities and fostering the creation of smart cities. Texts in natural language often compose such data. Nevertheless, the inference of useful information from a linguistic-computational analysis of natural language data is an open challenge. In this paper, we propose a clustering method to analyze textual data employing the unsupervised machine learning algorithms k-means and hierarchical clustering. We assess different vector representation methods for text, similarity metrics, and the number of clusters that best matches the data. We evaluate the methods using a real database of a public record service of security occurrences. The results show that the k-means algorithm using Euclidean distance extracts non-trivial knowledge, reaching up to 93% accuracy in a set of test samples while identifying the 12 most prevalent occurrence patterns.},

  abstract={Competitions became a common ground for city halls fostering the creation of useful mobile and Web applications for Smart Cities. A fact that started to be pointed out is that many of the apps developed in these civic apps competitions tend to be abandoned after the winners are announced. Different authors attempt to explain that phenomenon by arguing in different directions, alleging bad features, bad quality or lack investments from the cities organizing the contests, among other reasons. Evidence in academic research is mostly based on superficial research about the contests and interviews with organizers of these competitions. We wanted to gather quantitative data to measure the longevity of apps that eventually become abandoned, their perceived quality and the impact of the civic apps produced in these contests. In a case study of contests held by three big metropolitan cities in different countries, we surveyed a total of 122 apps that won prizes in 11 civic apps, from 2009 to 2015. We also interviewed organizers of the events to combine their perspective with our results. After checking app by app, we gathered information on which ones are still being used and estimated the impact based on different parameters such as the number of users, and the economic impact of those. This article presents preliminary findings of this study.},

  abstract={The increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is among the main problems faced by the growth of road transportation in Sao Paulo, the Brazilian city with the highest concentration of vehicles accounting for 28,000 vehicles per 100,000 inhabitants. Electric mobility has the potential to catalyze the development of transport, contributing to mitigate climate change, and support incipient smart cities projects with an adequate electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) network. This study comes up with the mapping of well-suited locations for EVCS by using geographic information system (GIS) analysis in combination with knowledge from a survey conducted with local electric vehicle (EV) experts. The method was tested to meet the increasing demand for EVs in the municipality of Sao Paulo by 2025, assuming the need for around 3,300 EVCS stations to support a penetration of 1 percent of EVs in urban private cars. EVCS is ideally situated in one third of the municipal districts of Sao Paulo, namely the Center, South Center, West and Southeast areas. Attributes such as unsafe non-urbanized areas and risk places subject to floods were highlighted as new findings to consider in Sao Paulo, with similar characteristics as others in Latin America areas, providing some insights about the challenges on the way to smart cities.},

  pages={85627-85644},
  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) acts as an umbrella for the Internet-enabled devices for various applications, such as smart home, smart city, smart grid, and smart healthcare. The emergence of the immense economic potential necessitates a robust authentication mechanism that needs to be lightweight and suitable for real-time applications. Moreover, the physical integrity of these devices cannot be assumed as these are designed to be deployed in an unattended environment with minimum human supervision. A user authentication mechanism for the IoT, in addition to guaranteeing user anonymity and un-traceability functionality requirements, must also be resistant to device physical capture and related misuses. In this paper, we present a novel lightweight anonymous user authentication protocol for the IoT environment by utilizing “cryptographic one-way hash function”, “physically unclonable function (PUF)” and “bitwise exclusive-OR (XOR)” operations. The broadly accepted Real-Or-Random (ROR) model-based formal security analysis, formal security verification using the automated software verification tool, namely “automated validation of internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA)” and also non-mathematical (informal) security analysis have been carried out on the proposed scheme. It is shown that the proposed scheme has the ability to resist various well-known attacks that are crucial for securing the IoT environment. Through a detailed comparative study, we show that the proposed scheme outperforms other existing related schemes in terms of computation and communication costs, and also security & functionality features. Finally, a practical demonstration of the proposed scheme using the NS3 simulation has been provided for measuring various network performance parameters.},

  abstract={The widespread adoption of 5G cellular technology will evolve as one of the major drivers for the growth of IoT-based applications. In this paper, we consider a Service Provider (SP) that launches a smart city service based on IoT data readings: in order to serve IoT data collected across different locations, the SP dynamically negotiates and rescales bandwidth and service functions. 5G network slicing functions are key to lease appropriate amount of resources over heterogeneous access technologies and different site types. Also, different infrastructure providers will charge slicing service depending on specific access technology supported across sites and IoT data collection patterns. We introduce a pricing mechanism based on Age of Information (AoI) to reduce the cost of SPs. It provides incentives for devices to smooth traffic by shifting part of the traffic load from highly congested and more expensive locations to lesser charged ones, while meeting QoS requirements of the IoT service. The proposed optimal pricing scheme comprises a two-stage decision process, where the SP determines the pricing of each location and devices schedule uploads of collected data based on the optimal uploading policy. Simulations show that the SP attains consistent cost reductions tuning the trade-off between slicing costs and the AoI of uploaded IoT data.},

The stringent Line of Sight (LoS) requirement in VLC makes it very suitable for Indoor Positioning System (IPS), to be used for autonomous and smart city infrastructure. The current work aims to implement a real time IPS system using VLC link in Network Simulator (NS-3). The VLC module is implemented by modelling real-time attributes of LEDs, optical channel, and the photodiodes. The localization is carried out using trilateration scheme which measures received signal strength interference (RSSI) for position estimation of the target. Furthermore, a comparison is carried out between VLC link and other existing technology, Wi-Fi, as far as positioning accuracy and other important performance metrics are concerned. The simulation results show significant improvement for the VLC link over the Wi-Fi link.},

  abstract={As the energy management undergoes rapid transformations, there’s an imperative need for innovative energy management frameworks. Responding to this, our research introduces an advanced energy management framework, synergistically combining quantum computing advancements with a robust trust management system. At the core of our proposition is the utilization of Quantum Annealing (QA) and Quantum-inspired Genetic Algorithm (QGA) for energy distribution, offering marked improvements in speed, accuracy, and scalability. Complementing this, multi-objective decision-making algorithms are integrated, optimizing trade-offs in intricate scenarios. Central to ensuring system reliability, the trust management system ensures improved regulation and compliance adherence. Our approach’s potency is further evidenced by its wide applicability, demonstrated through diverse case studies ranging from solar power plant management to smart city energy distribution. Experimental simulations underscore the framework’s efficacy, establishing its relevance in today’s dynamic energy ecosystems.},

  abstract={The widespread adoption of 5G cellular technology is becoming the major driver for the growth of IoT-based applications. In this paper we consider a Mobile Service Provider (MSP) that launches a smart city service based on IoT data readings. In order to serve IoT data collected across different locations, the MSP dynamically negotiates and rescales bandwidth and service functions. 5G network slicing functions are key to lease appropriate amount of resources over heterogeneous access technologies and different site types. Also, different infrastructure providers will charge slicing service depending on specific access technology supported across regional sites and IoT data collection patterns.We introduce a pricing mechanism based on Age of Information (AoI) to reduce the cost of MSPs. It provides incentives for devices to smooth traffic by shifting part of the traffic load from highly congested and more expensive locations to lesser charged ones, while meeting QoS requirements of the IoT service. The proposed optimal pricing scheme comprises a two-stage decision process, where the MSP determines the pricing of each location and devices schedule uploads of collected data based on the optimal uploading policy. Simulations show that the MSP attains consistent cost reductions tuning the trade-off between slicing costs and the AoI of uploaded IoT data.},

  abstract={As we all know that the technology is projected to be next to humans very soon because of its holistic growth. Now-a-days, we see a lot of applications that are making our lives comfortable such as smart cars, smart homes, smart traffic management, smart offices, smart medical consultation, smart cities, etc. All such facilities are in the reach of a common man because of the advancement in Information and Communications Technology (ICT). Because of this advancement, new computing and communication environment such as Internet of Things (IoT) came into picture. Lot of research work is in progress in IoT domain which helps for the overall development of the society and makes the lives easy and comfortable. But in the resource constrained environment of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) and IoT, it is almost inconceivable to establish a fully secure system. As we are moving forward very fast, technology is becoming more and more vulnerable to the security threats. In future, the number of Internet connected people will be less than the smart objects so we need to prepare a robust system for keeping the above mentioned environments safe and standardized it for the smooth conduction of communication among IoT objects. In this survey paper, we provide the details of threat model applicable for the security of WSN and IoT based communications. We also discuss the security requirements and various attacks possible in WSN and IoT based communication environments. The emerging projects of WSNs integrated to IoT are also briefed. We then provide the details of different architectures of WSN and IoT based communication environments. Next, we discuss the current issues and challenges related to WSN and IoT. We also provide a critical literature survey of recent intrusion detection protocols for IoT and WSN environments along with their comparative analysis. A taxonomy of security and privacy-preservation protocols in WSN and IoT is also highlighted. Finally, we discuss some research challenges which need to be addressed in the coming future.},

  abstract={Trustful Internet of Things (IoT) plays an important role in smart cities. The trust information in surveillance data motivates the analysis of images from numerous IoT devices. Saliency detection is a fundamental step in surveillance data analysis for providing help to the subsequent tasks, but unsuitable to IoT applications owing to the neglect of image similarity and difference from diverse IoT devices. To solve this problem, we enable the co-saliency detection in IoT, which detects the common and salient foreground regions in the group surveillance images. The main contributions include: 1) enable a multistage context perception scheme to efficiently extract the contextual information corresponding to different-size receptive fields in the single image; 2) construct a two-path information propagation to extract the interimage similarity and difference from the high-level image feature representations of the group images; and 3) propose the stage-wise refinement to allocate the label information to different parts of the network for helping the network to learn the enriched semantically common knowledge. The extensive experiments performed on three public data sets can demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its superiority to four state-of-the-art co-saliency detection methods.},

  abstract={Advances in the miniaturization, computational capabilities, and cost reduction of semiconductor technology have made global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) the favorite choice for positioning. Currently, positioning is a key factor for many essential tasks in our modern society and will become even more important with the advent of new concepts such as the Internet of Things (IoT), smart cities and autonomous driving. The extensive use of GNSSs in a wide range of applications has caused their migration from the professional segment to the mass-market segment in terms of both technology and performance. This presents new and more stringent requirements in terms of accuracy, robustness, ubiquity, and continuity for the original “open sky” GNSS design. GNSS technology has experienced an unprecedented evolution in the last decade, and it is expected to exponentially evolve in the next decade. This evolution is considered in this paper with the aim of providing a unified reference for current GNSS receiver technologies and solutions and its expected evolution in the next decade. We consider receiver concepts, antennae, RF front ends, digital signal processing, and positioning algorithms. The impacts on the different GNSS market segments and applications are also analyzed.},

  pages={187671-187686},
  abstract={Intelligent Transportation System (ITS) in sustainable smart cities are taking advantage of moving vehicle nodes for data communication. VANETs support many applications related to safety, infotainment, and accident detection. The routing protocols are using for data communication in the presence of high mobility nodes and dynamic topologies. Due to high mobility and unpredictable topologies, the data communication becomes unreliable which causes data loss, delay, and link disconnections among vehicle nodes. To address these routing limitations, various types of routing protocols have developed. In all existing routing protocols types, geographic routing protocols are one of the efficient types due to its low overhead processes. Geographical routing protocols are able to handle vehicular environment constraints. However, with many advantages, geographic routing protocols are not considering many constraints of the vehicular environment. Geographical routing protocols should have well-defined routing metrics to deal with high mobility and other data loss and link disconnection issues. This research designs a Beaconless Traffic-Aware Geographical Routing Protocol (BTA-GRP) by considering traffic density, distance and direction for next forwarder node and route selection. The protocol is feasible for urban dense and sparse traffic conditions and addresses delay, disconnection and packet dropping issues. The proposed protocol has simulated with state of the art routing protocols. The simulation results indicated that the proposed protocol has higher performance in VANETs.},

  abstract={Vehicular networks have received much attention in recent years as they have emerged as one of the leading data communication solutions for smart cities. At the same time, the popularization of sensing devices has enabled the acquisition of a vast amount of vehicular mobility data (mobility traces). In this sense, a recent trend is to use mobility traces to extract hidden knowledge and apply it to improve solutions for vehicular networks. In this article, we present and discuss a workflow, through a short survey, related to the process of generating mobility traces, preprocessing these datasets, and obtaining knowledge to create intelligent vehicular networks. We describe the main types of mobility data highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. We classify the primary methods for obtaining knowledge from mobility data. Also, we exemplify how these mobility traces and methods can be applied to vehicular networks by reviewing recent contributions. Furthermore, we illustrate through a case study how to obtain knowledge from a specific type of mobility trace. Finally, we point out new research directions that involve mobility traces and intelligent vehicular networks.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things is getting momentum and generating new demands over infrastructure, systems, and platforms. One of the main aspects that hamper the large-scale development of IoT-based systems is the lack of interoperability. IoT Platforms aim to solve this issue by providing a uniform interface to access data from heterogeneous sources. However, integrating new protocols and applications can impose additional overhead, hindering the platform’s overall performance and scalability. This study provides an insight into the trade-off between interoperability and performance of IoT platforms. First, we present a qualitative analysis of three open-source platforms - FIWARE, ThingsBoard, and Konker - analyzing their interoperability features. Second, we conduct a performance evaluation emulating two IoT-based environments – smart cities and smart health – to understand each platform’s scalability, response time, and computer resource usage. Finally, we analyze the possible trade-offs between interoperability features and scalability based on the qualitative and quantitative analysis. The results show that interoperability features do not have a direct impact on the performance of the platform.},

Our solution balances users' satisfaction with resources consumption as it is capable of choosing the most adequate resolution algorithm based on the current application's situation.

  abstract={Recent advances in sensor technologies and instrumentation have led to an extraordinary growth of data sources and streaming applications. A wide variety of devices, from smart phones to dedicated sensors, have the capability of collecting and streaming data at unprecedented rates. Typical applications include smart cities & built environments for instance, where sensor-based infrastructures continue to increase in scale and variety. Analysis of stream data involves: (i) execution of a number of operations on a time/sample window - e.g. min./max./avg., filtering, etc, (ii) a need to combine a number of such operations together, (iii) event-driven execution of operations, generally over short time durations, (iv) operation correlations across multiple data streams. The use of such operations does not fit well in the per-hour or per-minute cloud billing models currently available from cloud providers - with some notable exceptions (e.g. Amazon AWS). In this paper we discuss how micro-billing and sub-second resource allocation can be used in the context of streaming applications and how micro-billing models bring challenges to capacity management on cloud infrastructures.},

  abstract={The current Internet design falls short in scenarios characterized by intermittent connectivity and absence of supporting infrastructure. Pocket switched networking allows communication between portable handheld user devices in such environments through the store-carry-forward paradigm. This involves storing data in device memory, exploiting user movement to physically transport the data, and forwarding through available short-range wireless interfaces. In this regard, user devices can be leveraged as data mules for point-to-point communication in two main scenarios: (i) conveying data between major infrastructures in urban areas (e.g., transporting sensor data to gateways in smart cities); and (ii) extending wireless coverage to provide connectivity in developing regions (e.g., bridging user devices and remote Internet access points). User movement in such scenarios exhibit spatial locality, which is the preference to a geographical location than others. This feature influences the data transfer opportunities that exist between different sets of users. This paper investigates the impact of locality on routing in pocket switched networks by: (i) evaluating the performance of existing routing strategies for point-to-point communication over different degrees of locality; and (ii) providing insights towards enhancing routing performance for realizing the aforementioned application scenarios through locality awareness.},

Map sketching and contextual interviews were conducted with ten graduate students from University College London. A thematic analysis was used for coming up with suggestions regarding this user group. This paper also contributes with a summary of factors from the literature findings that can help identifying potential locations for other similar case studies.

SSA is characterized by time series field by performing a non-parametric spectral estimation with spatial-temporal correlations. Statistical outcomes have confirmed the requirement of accurate data imputation techniques to the Smart City environment, specifi¬cally in the surveillance scenario. In addition, the performance evaluation technique has allowed emphasizing the contribution of imputation data approaches.

  abstract={A social network is a valuable source of data that is useful to understand a wide range of events happening around the world, with each user being a potential contributor to accomplish this task. This work proposes a novel method to detect events in Twitter based on the calculation of entropy of the content of tweets in order to classify the most shared topic as an event or not. We observed that the entropy of the bigrams extracted from tweets are subject to a continuous phase transition when social media users start to react and interact with an event that is taking place. Hence, we propose a method to detect this phase transition, and consequently detect an event, and extract the keywords related to the corresponding event. We compared the performance of our method to other approaches of the literature and we observed that our method is the more regular among three metrics and reached the best overall performance. Furthermore, we present evidence that our method is very sensitive to correctly detect events that occur almost at same time.},

  pages={4657-4674},
  abstract={As delivery companies continue to explore the use of drones, the need for efficient and safe operation in urban environments becomes increasingly critical. Market-wide versions of drone delivery services will necessarily spread many drones, especially in big cities. In this scenario, avoiding collisions with other drones or typical obstacles in urban spaces is fundamental. This paper proposes and evaluates, via simulation and analytical modeling, an aerial delivery service scenario and three autonomous geometric approaches for collision avoidance. We compare our approaches with three simple methods – DoNothing (not detouring), Random, and aviation-like Rightward – and two state-of-the-art geometric approaches. Simulation experiments consider different fleet sizes with constant and Poisson drone arrival rates and drones randomly choosing one of different altitudes for the cruise flight. Contrary to our expectations, the Random and Rightward approaches increase the collisions compared with DoNothing, making the latter our baseline. Our approaches significantly reduce collisions in all experiments and deal with more drones within the detection radius, showing that collisions are more complex to avoid. Comparing the collision rate, successful trips, and the number of flying drones reveals that the efficiency in avoiding collisions reduces the number of successful trips by increasing the number of active drones. Regardless of the expected reduction in collisions, more altitudes do not eliminate them. These results indicate the need for more sophisticated approaches to reduce or eliminate collisions. The analytical modeling using Markov Chains corroborates the simulation results by shedding some light on and helping explain the simulation results.},

  abstract={Traffic Lights Signaling Optimization consists in optimizing traffic-light cycle using optimization algorithms. In this context, a traffic simulator can represent different road intersections and traffic lights and can calculate traffic quality measures. A solution to this problem can be encoded in a vector representing the time of each traffic light on the simulator and the objective functions are the traffic quality metrics. Since there are several metrics this problem can be defined as a many-objective optimization problem. In spite of the existence of several objective functions, the majority of the related work selects a small set, often two. This paper proposes a many-objective optimization framework based on objective reduction to solve Traffic lights Signaling Optimization Problem. Here, twelve objective functions are used. To deal with the high number of metrics, objective reduction techniques are applied along a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. An experimental set is conducted to analyze if it possible to reduce the number of objective functions on the Traffic lights Signaling Optimization Problem and if this reduction enhances the performance of the optimization algorithm.},

  abstract={Human society can be divided into communities composed of individuals who share similarities in behavior, interest, housing, and other features. These human communities are affected by events, such as advertising, and traffic accidents, among others, daily. These events may affect communities differently, accordingly to each community's characteristics. This paper proposes an approach to assess the spatial-temporal influence these events exert on different geolocation-based social communities, thus contributing to planning actions focused on these communities. In addition, this paper contributes to a better understanding of people's and communities' behavior once their mobility patterns are analyzed. We carried out a case study using the Geolife dataset, a trajectory dataset, to accomplish the above contributions. Thus, using a clustering technique, dataset users were divided into communities based on their geolocation history. For each community identified, we evaluated the degree of influence of events in eleven places of good circulation on different days of the week.},

  abstract={In this paper, a digital image processing methodology based on thermal images to detect and locate water leak in underground pipes will be presented. With the advent of smart cities, some countries began to face this problem with technologies, such as Smart Water Grids. However, with this proposal it is intended to contribute with the smart cities context but with a nondestructive and less complex system. Also, it is proposed in this paper the use of the q-sigmoid function that is an alternative to pre-processing step to digital image processing. The potential of this function will be validated as method to contrast enhancement and to highlight regions of interest. The proposal was applied in thermal images captured from the soil surface with an underground water leak. Such conditions were proposed into a laboratory, using an ideal model with sandy soil. The results obtained from this experiment were promising, since it was able to detect leaks at early stages of the experiment, which suggest a potential use of the methodology and the proposed preprocessing technique to detect water leaks.},

Our results attest that only one framework shows the most promise for memory-intensive testing, outperforming its counterparts by more than 20%.

  abstract={With the evolution of radio technologies during the last decades, companies are replacing equipment with individual components with particular functions by systems where most signals are treated digitally through digital signal processing techniques. In environments with numerous wireless equipment transmitting simultaneously, it is necessary to detect the frequency spectrum occupancy before deploying a new solution. A spectrum analyzer can analyze this, but the cost of acquiring suitable equipment can be very high. Besides that, these devices only allow the user to analyze the frequency spectrum, not the technology itself, packet loss, data rate, and coverage, without an expensive software license installed. This article presents a software-defined radio application development capable of evaluating wireless channels for new IoT technologies, such as Bluetooth or Wi-SUN.},

  abstract={From its emergence to the present day, traffic light control systems have been widely used to monitor and control the flow of vehicles. However, with the increasing number of public (bus) and private vehicles (car, motorcycle, and truck), urban centers are becoming more and more populous. Such phenomenon leads to traffic congestion and increases environmental and noise pollution. In order to stem the rise of such problems, large cities are adopting technological solutions, materializing the concept of smart cities. While observing traffic management systems themselves, several hardware and software solutions have been studied and implemented around the world. This article aims to contribute to traffic signals improvement by developing a centralized traffic light control system, using a unique wireless communication network. In order to prove the system's effectiveness, the most common types of urban intersections were analyzed. Direct control routines were implemented for network traffic lights, providing a complete control system for extraordinary events, such as closing roads due to accidents or public events. Finally, safety routines were formulated to report the operating status of the traffic light system lamps to a central management. With the aid of a logic analyzer connected to the outputs for each focal group, it was possible to set up an operating stages timing diagram of each traffic light. Thus, the system validation was achieved based on theoretical and practical timing diagrams similarities.},

  abstract={In the telecommunications industry, currently to determine the quality of service of a cellular network in a certain area, measurements are made of some RF parameters; this operation is called a "Drive Test", and it is done using dedicated equipment which is often costly. This process is slow, expensive and must be repeated several times manually by some institutions (operators and government regulatory entities) in order to optimize the network. On the other hand, there is currently a great interest in transforming cities into smart cities. One way to do that is applying some techniques related to Industry 4.0, which aims to improve industrial processes using enabling technologies such as IoT and Cloud Computing, automating processes and making them smarter. This paper aims to characterize these enabling technologies applied to the scenario of the telecommunication industry. In this sense, to improve the test drive, an architecture is proposed for monitoring the quality of service for mobile telephony, collecting RF parameters and processing in real time. In addition, a proof of concept of the system with free platforms is presented.},

Social movements in the form of protests are an example of this growing need for society's participation. One thing that can expand these possibilities is technology. It is correct to affirm that the advancement of smart city and popularization of technology - more specifically, of social media - has established new opportunities to expand these virtual spaces. In line with this scenario, there are several initiatives whose objective is to develop tools that facilitate or promote citizen participation. However, there are still many issues that need to be investigated in order for the use of these tools to be effective. The objective of this work was to propose a tool that facilitates the discussion of societal problems by citizens. In the analysis of the results - obtained through an experiment with users to evaluate the effectiveness of the tool - it could be seen that, although the majority of users agreed that the discussion model and the proposed problem register can contribute to the real solution of the problem, it could also be seen that citizens still lack motivation and engagement - something that needs to be studied and improved.},

This leads cities to face an ever greater challenge in providing suitable management of the different resources and services necessary to attend their citizens. The development of the modern city with their huge amount of vehicles and saturation of people caused the development of even greater stress to cities population, with extreme stress conditions occurring with respect to urban mobility. In fact, the citizen finds the streets congested, insecure and overcrowded by a polluted environment (air, visual and noise pollution). For this reason it is necessary to study, develop and implement alternatives of managing mobility to improve the quality of life of people leaving in cities. This research focus on analyzing experiences from several cities that are reference in the subject of mobility in order to study evolution of mobility and describe a model, based on computational intelligence, for making analytic predictions on urban mobility.},

However, world IoT production capacity would have to increase by two orders of magnitude to allow a meaningful level of mapping that could be felt in our daily lives. There are several technological challenges related to increasing IoT production by two orders of magnitude, such as the energy impact we would need to deal with. This work aims to introduce the idea that part of these challenges could be solved by changing the traditional computational architecture to the so-called Neuromorphic, a computational architecture based on biological brains. The work consisted of an extensive literature review that analyzed data on the specifications of prototypes of Neuromorphic architecture devices that were published in scientific databases. As a result, it was shown that Neuromorphic devices could meet the requirements and solve some challenges related to the increase that the world needs in the production of IoT, without the need for long periods of technology development.},

This innovation in urban infrastructure of cities and the impacts of intensive application of technology are still being identified and mapped. A fundamental aspect under technological viewpoint to make this novelty a reality, and most comprehensive as possible is related to communication networks. Concept of Internet of Things (IoT) only materializes through a combination of technologies based on private and public networks and the Internet as the main platform. Utilities companies have already started their participation in this process in sense that they are deploying smart grids using technologies like RF Mesh and PLC, being RF Mesh the most widespread in world markets. But it is necessary to insert smart grid projects in the context of smart cities and in its converging alternatives of communications infrastructure. This work explores an emerging technology named as Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) and proposes that this is the current alternative best suited to the big scenario of IoT, in which smart grids are included, and also compares with the RF Mesh technology widely adopted for this application.},

  abstract={Time series forecasting is an essential task in the management of Smart Cities and Smart Grids, becoming even more challenging when it needs to deal with big data time series. The development of highly accurate machine learning models is yet harder when considering the optimization of hyperparameters, which is an expensive computational task. To tackle these challenges this work proposes the Distributed Evolutionary Hyperparameter Optimization (DEHO) for the Weighted Multivariate Fuzzy Time Series method (WMVFTS), a simple and non-parametric forecasting method with high scalability and accuracy, comprising a sequential training and forecasting procedure and a MapReduce extension for distributed processing. The proposed methods were evaluated using a cluster with commodity hardware and two big time series, showing increasing speed up for training and test times as new CPU cores are added to cluster. Then the DEHO method was executed in the computational cluster, achieving fast convergence and feasible processing time and generating highly accurate WMVFTS models.},

  abstract={There will be a profound impact from 5G to develop smart cities. Questions such as “How telecommunication operators will efficiently provide network infrastructure”, “When and where the quality of service parameters are degraded or below expected” are to be considered. In this context, the use of base stations carried by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) acting as flying cells to compensate areas where telecommunications systems are challenged by abnormal conditions during their operation has attracted attention. In this paper, we propose an intelligent solution based on a novel multilayered cellular automata for positioning flying cells and improvement of network capacity in context heavy traffic situations as congested cars in avenues in some hours of the day, crowded events, disaster or hot spot traffic. In our distributed approach, all UAV base stations operate in parallel. The self-organisation arises from an emergent pattern based on applying simple rules in a defined neighbourhood. The proposed scheme considers both backhaul and radio access network constraints, and user requirements in terms of downlink throughput. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs favourably compared with other schemes in terms of all metrics considered. Therefore, we provide a solution for rapid and efficient positioning of multiple UAV base stations to respond in real time to urgent network changes.},

Unlocking these networks for enhanced wireless access to select users and devices, through dynamically sharing the unused portion of hotspots bandwidth, is key to provide seamless connectivity. Far from providing just basic wireless connectivity, we argue that these WLANs can be efficiently exploited to cope with emerging applications in the context of smart cities, massive machine type communication, and cellular data offloading. We introduce an approach aimed at the efficient sharing of available WLANs resources, allowing applications of domestic or enterprise users to coexist with third-party applications. To achieve this goal, we go beyond existing solutions by proposing the virtualization of access networks to offer differentiated networking services in an isolated manner. However, commodity wireless access devices are low-cost and performance-constrained, in contrast to carrier-grade systems that are very costly by deploying high networking performance. For this paper, we focus on the suitability of our approach on the customer premises, by assessing key performance networking aspects of SDN-enabled commodity wireless access devices, to obtain a better perspective of their current limitations.},

  abstract={Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITSs) will be part of our daily lives, where new services are bringing novel challenges for smart cities. The ITS services rely on vehicular clouds (VC) to aggregate tasks from other vehicles to provide cloud services closest to the vehicular users. However, the resource and task allocation processes in dynamic and mobile environments are still open issues. This paper proposes a task optimization mechanism based on the meta-heuristic algorithm of the Grey Wolf Optimizer, called TOVEC. It aims to improve the usage of the available resources in a VC and maximizing task allocation. Simulation results showed that the TOVEC increases the number of tasks served by up to 34.2%, maximizes the use of resources by up to 21.5%, and improves the allocation reward by up to 24.7% compared to Greedy and Dynamic Programming (DP) methods.},

  abstract={Low-cost particulate matter (LC-PM) sensors have been studied around the world as a viable alternative to expensive reference stations for monitoring air quality. However, LC-PM sensors require periodic calibration, since their data are often inaccurate and subject to uncertainty. Sensors calibration can be performed through machine learning methods where the sensor is placed in a real environment subject to the local environmental conditions of the place and its measurement compared to a reference equipment. This work evaluates different machine learning methods in five different models of LC-PM sensors, aiming to select the most appropriate sensor and a calibration method to be used in a low-cost air quality station in the context of smart cities.},

  abstract={The traditional electric power distribution network is evolving to support scalable and connected services in Smart Cities (SC). The emergence of Smart Grid (SG) architecture connects Smart Meters (SM) to the Electric Power Company (EPC) using various communication technologies like Power Line Communication (PLC) and wireless networks such as 5G, LoRa, and others. However, the vast amount of data generated by this infrastructure can lead to network overload and storage and processing challenges. To address this, this paper proposes implementing a Big Data Analytics framework under the Hybrid Demand Side Management as a Service (HyDSMaaS) architecture in the Multi Microgrid scenario. This approach divides the SG into Microgrids, creating smaller groups of nodes and transforming the centralized infrastructure into a scalable and decentralized one. Additionally, a monitoring system using Grafana was implemented to manage server usage flow and monitor access and services. The framework achieved high speed compared to traditional models and demonstrated accuracy of nearly 99.9% in consumption prediction and power quality classification algorithms when operating with up to 1000 microgrids in under 1000 seconds.},

  abstract={The space inside a vehicle, which people can enjoy while travelling, is becoming more intelligent due to the technological developments within the automotive industry. This has influenced the increase in new services that are intended to fulfil the needs of vehicle users. This article presents a survey on the provisioning of ubiquitous intelligent services for vehicular users. It also identifies clusters of research interest on this subject. To this end, an evaluation of results from six scientific research databases supports these goals. This process initially identified 37 328 publications; after filtering and clustering, the scope of analysis became 39 articles. The main contributions points to (i) the existence of five active research clusters, as a result of the inclusion of a visual clustering step in the systematic mapping protocol; (ii) an indication of a string of studies starting in the late ’90s from traffic issues, intelligent transport systems and profiling, to smart cities, the Internet of Things, big data, fog computing and internet of vehicles in recent years; and (iii) that the main challenges associated with the implementation of ubiquitous intelligent services for vehicular users are related to data security, infrastructure, connectivity and high mobility.},

Big Data analysis is attracting more and more developers and researchers, and at least five requirements (Velocity, Volume, Value, Variety, and Veracity) show challenges in deploying such solutions. Across the globe, many Smart City initiatives are using Big Data Analytics as a tool for doing predictive analytics which can be helpful to human well being. This work presents a generic architecture named Machine Learning in Microservices Architecture (MLMA) that provides design patterns to transform a monolithic architecture of machine learning pipelines in microservices with separate roles. We present two case studies deployed to a Smart City initiative, where we discuss how each component of the architecture applied in specific applications that use predictions with machine learning.

  abstract={Large cities are increasingly investing in efficient mobility and sustainable transportation as an alternative to expensive and pollutant traditional vehicles. In parallel, people are also seeking cleaner and healthier options for short and last-mile distances. In order to cope with this trend, which has boosted the adoption of bikes in urban areas, a major concern of the governments has been to build bike paths and tracks that allow cyclists to move safely and through shorter distances. However, such initiatives may result in bicycles infrastructure built alongside traditional vehicular roads or on inadequate regions. Therefore, there should be a flexible way to assess the quality of bike paths and tracks, combining variables that indicate adverse conditions for the health and safety of cyclists, such as statistical risk of accidents, air and noise pollution, excessive sunlight exposure, dangerous UV radiation, among others. This article then proposes a new comprehensive quality metric that combines sensed environmental data and historical reported incidents related to bike paths and tracks, which may be employed for traditional physical signaling or to support computer-assisted solutions for cycling monitoring and alerting. Such new metric exploits fuzzy logic to model a group of variables to ultimately provide a unified safety and health quality level, referred as BikeWay. Doing so, we expect to allow dynamic and historical perceptions of how healthy and safe the bike paths and tracks are for cyclists in modern cities.},

  abstract={Over the years, knowledge on how to engineer software-intensive system-of-systems (SoS) have been expanded and advanced. With the emergence of smart cities, which is a remarkable example of SoS, there is also an emerging need that almost any type of system should be prepared to join the smart city system and become a constituent of that SoS, even temporarily. However, several attempts to build a real SoS have stumbled on the limitations of single systems, also known as Constituent System (CS), to fully interoperate in the context of a SoS. The majority of the existing systems were not designed to be part of a SoS, interoperate in a instantaneous way, or maintain their operational independence despite their participation in one or more SoS. Based on this context, the main contribution of this paper is to exploit how to design a software architecture for systems that are intended to become part of a SoS in the future. We conducted a software architecture design process to conceive a constituent architecture for Urban Mobility domain as CS. We evaluated the architecture by means of simulation. Preliminary results reveal that our proposal comply with the requirements raised during the architectural design process and can increase the possibility of a system to be a constituent of SoS.},

  abstract={In developing effective public security policies, two aspects are essential: intelligence and information. In this context, the classification of Macrocauses can help governments better understand some aspects of public security related to the analysis of violent crimes in a state. In the Brazilian state of Rio Grande do Norte (RN), these analyses are currently done by analyzing raw data done by an expert without any specific auxiliary system, known as traditional approaches. It is a time-consuming task, and different experts may have different views on the same case. With this in mind, in this work, we intend to assist these criminal experts by providing a predictive model that classifies the Macrocauses of crimes into a set of pre-defined types to guide the work of the experts and, as a consequence, to speed up the analysis and management processes. Thus, a feature preprocessing was performed in which three different classification techniques are analyzed. The results show that when using XGBoost, the model accuracy reached 0.932378, which is considered excellent for this application.},

  abstract={In urban mobility scope, one of the main current challenges is fast and localized information gathering for decision making. In this sense, social media can be an information extraction source for several tasks, such as traffic control. However, these data have to be well classified in order to ensure that only relevant information is used. Particularly in Portuguese-speaking countries, there are not many works with this approach. Thus, we designed a methodology to identify traffic information from social media using modern techniques for classification. In addition, we generated a dataset, by extracting and manually labeling tweets in Portuguese language, and used deep learning techniques to classify these messages with respect to the traffic domain. Finally, we perform experiments employing different combinations of deep learning architectures for representation and classification, obtaining results of more than 95% on average for accuracy and precision metrics.},

  abstract={The rapid urbanization of cities has given rise to numerous challenges related to essential services and emergency management. To address these complexities, smart city solutions have emerged, employing advanced technologies to automate and enhance service quality. In this context, wireless sensor networks and the Internet of Things offer promising solutions for monitoring and detecting emergencies in urban environments. However, urban emergency detection is a complex task that requires intelligent data processing and analysis. Many existing approaches utilize artificial intelligence techniques to improve accuracy. Moreover, the time-critical nature of emergency detection necessitates swift and reliable diagnosis to avoid potential economic losses and human risks. To achieve precise and timely detection, a system capable of collecting georeferenced data, analyzing it, and providing reliable diagnoses is essential. In this paper, we propose a novel urban multiple emergency detection system based on hierarchical, collaborative and configurable wireless sensor networks. The hierarchical and collaborative nature of the proposed networks ensures efficient data exchange between sensing units of different categories. Our contributions lie in the implementation of flexible and configurable functionalities, enabling accurate and energy-efficient urban emergency detection adaptable to the unique characteristics of each city or region where it is deployed.},

Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) has proved to be a useful method to enhance the capacity of radio link systems in 4G and beyond networks. Similarly, Visible Light Communication (VLC) is considered to be an environmental-friendly complementing technology for 6G networks. In this work, we have investigated the suitability of flexible transmitters and receivers for MIMO-based Visible Light Communication System for next-generation-networks. We created a channel state information (CSI) matrix based on random, Exponential, Rayleigh, and Gaussian distribution. Our results show that the randomly generated CSI matrix without diagonal maximization yields the worst performance whereas if the CSI matrix follows Gaussian distribution, VLC based MIMO system executes the best performance in terms of bit error rate (BER) against signal to noise ratio (SNR). Based on our results, we introduced the concept of flexible transmitters and receivers which can orient themselves at the physical layer based on the feedback received from the channel. We further extend our investigations by considering a square network of MIMO transmitters and receivers. Simulation results show that as the number of transmitters increases, BER performance deteriorates for independent data streams.},

This paper proposes the MobiAlert, an embedded system that utilizes geospatial data to evaluate the safety of cycling in urban areas. By analyzing the proximity to emergency response infrastructure and taking GPS coordinates, MobiAlert indicates the current risk level that a bicycle is experiencing, offering cyclists real-time alerts when crossing more critical areas. Implemented on a Raspberry Pi Zero board, MobiAlert is a cost-effective and efficient solution adaptable to diverse urban settings, allowing easy reproduction. Initial experiments based on the city of Porto, Portugal, demonstrates the practical applicability and effectiveness of this approach in enhancing safety for cyclists and promoting sustainable mobility.},

This innovative approach, leveraging geospatial analytics and clustering techniques, provides a practical framework for city planners and policymakers to prioritize and implement measures for enhancing cyclist safety, for any urban area in the world.

To demonstrate the framework's process, we created a use case analyzing the characteristics of two distinct traces (Taxi and IoT-Objects).

This paper presents existing mathematical models and useful equations that can be employed when computing coverage, organizing and comparing them for different scenarios when analyzing coverage performance and computational costs. Moreover, a simulation scenario is defined considering a typical visual monitoring application in an industrial plant, presenting coverage results for different visual sensing models. Analyzing their mathematical costs, researchers can better decide which model and configuration parameters are more suitable for their needs, benefiting new works in this area.},

Multiple Object Tracking (MOT) is a complex and fundamental problem in computer vision for robotic vehicles, requiring individual evaluation of various detected mobile agents to make informed decisions. To address this challenge, we utilize embedded and dedicated hardware systems, along with Deep Learning algorithms, as powerful tools for realtime processing of computer vision.

  abstract={Smart connected vehicles are becoming standardized with the incorporation of information and communication technology. Connected vehicles are employed for surveillance and management of road traffic, navigation assistance, etc., by inheriting different analytical and communication techniques. With the Social Internet of Things (SIoT), interogrowthperable and shared computing models are adopted by the connected vehicles to perform application-specific decisions. By considering the need for computation models in smart connected vehicle networks, this article introduces a shared adaptive computing model (SACM) for improving the reliability of vehicle control and traffic management. This computing model considers multiple features of the in-range vehicles in detecting traffic and providing guided solutions for reliable routing in a smart city environment. This computing model is aided by the conditional support vector machine (SVM) for differentiating the complexity of multiflow data processing from the neighboring vehicles. The physical and connectivity-based factors from the smart vehicle using SVM classification learning improve the decision reliability and reduce the computing time and complexity.},

This article proposes a case study of an ITS system with a Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) architecture using the platform for time-sensitive ITS applications. The platform aims to support ITS applications with strict requirements for latency and requests loss. We evaluated an ITS application in three different scenarios: in the cloud using a 4G connection, in the cloud using broadband, and in MEC. We compare scenarios using quantitative metrics such as requests per second, average response time, and request loss rate. The experimental results indicate that MEC has a lower loss of requests and it can work with a greater number of requests per second, which makes it a good solution for ITS applications.},

  abstract={Efficient urban mobility proved to be a major challenge for smart cities. A better use of the urban traffic infrastructure is key in the effort of mitigating the effects of traffic congestion. Popular approaches range from classical control and optimization to multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). This paper follows the latter track. Challenges here are manifold. First, most of the literature assumes that either traffic lights learn (while drivers do not change their behaviors) or viceversa. Second, no matter what kind of class of learning agents is considered, their actions are highly coupled (thus making the learning task harder). Third, when both classes of agents co-learn, these learning tasks are of different nature (from the point of view of MARL). Finally, a microscopic modeling and simulation of the this problem is not trivial. Therefore, this paper not only proposes a co-learning approach in which agents act in a shared environment, but also argues that this task needs to be formulated asynchronously. Besides, driver agents are able to update the value of the available actions by receiving information from other drivers. Results show that the co-learning approach outperforms other policies in terms of average travel time of all vehicles. Moreover, when co-learning is used, a better distribution of the trips within the network is observed.},

  abstract={With the development of smart cities, the demand for artificial intelligence (AI) based services grows exponentially. The existing works just focus on cloud- edge or edge-device cooperative AI which suffers low learning efficiency of AI, while edge-to-edge cooperative AI is still an unresolved issue. Moreover, the existing researches concentrate on the computation offloading of the AI-based task, ignoring that it is a brain-like task performing sophisticated processing to raw data, which leads to the high latency and low quality of the learning services. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an on-demand learning offloading mechanism for edge-to-edge cooperative AI. Firstly, the principle of the learning capability and its offloading are proposed for the formal description of the learning resources migration. Secondly, the proposed mechanism realizes the bilateral learning offloading utilizing edge-to-edge and cloud-edge collaborations to handle AI-based tasks with high learning efficiency and resource utilization rate. Moreover, we model the edge-to-edge learning offloading allocation based on the concatenation of deep neural network (DNN) subtasks and their heterogeneous requirement of learning resources. Simulation results indicate the rationality and efficiency of the proposed mechanism.},

In this paper, we perform MAC layer optimization for maximizing throughput subject to application-specific needs and energy availability in Solar Energy Harvesting Wireless Sensor Networks (EH-WSNs). In contrast to previous schemes that limit energy consumption based on current availability only, we propose Energy Prediction based Energy Management algorithm (EPEM). This algorithm exploits energy prediction and sets threshold rate of energy consumption to ensure accumulation of sufficient energy for non- energy harvesting period. Our analysis shows that MAC optimization (MO) along with EPEM algorithm not only improves performance by 72% but also avoids energy scarcity during non-energy harvesting period.},

  year={2022},
  volume={},
  number={},
  pages={1-7},
  abstract={The use of a mobile sink in wireless sensor networks has been a game changing to enable the development of smart cities applications. The mobility feature allows more effective data gathering and energy saving in the network, since the sink can be closer to source nodes, which could activate their radios only when the sink approximates. Doing so, more efficient settings can be achieved when configuring and deploying sensor nodes for a myriad of applications. However, this mobility-centric strategy can generate applications scenarios with large delays when sensor networks are monitoring the environment, which may result in considerable data losses in critical applications. To cope with that, this paper proposes an algorithm to dynamically plan the repositioning of a single mobile sink within distributed sensing applications. The algorithm considers dependability requirements associated with network connectivity, operability, and energy consumption, implicitly minimizing the energy-hole problem and connectivity issues. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate how the can be applied to move the sink through the network meeting dependability requirements.},

  abstract={Indoor air quality has a critical impact on human and animal health and well-being. Because of the confinement during the Covid-19 health crisis, millions of people were forced to stay at home. Therefore, living environments should incorporate an automated monitoring system to detect unfavorable air quality scenarios. Also, Internet of things (IoT) due to their ability to carry air low-cost sensing units have become a cheap alternative to monitor pollution values in a given area. However, enough still needs to be learned as these types of studies are expected to increase in the future years. In this paper, we have developed an intelligent IoT-fuzzy-based device based on low-cost sensors for indoor air quality monitoring (IoT-fuzzy-based AQM). It used a type-1 fuzzy inference system to improve the measurement accuracy of the low-cost sensors and to estimate the air quality index. Experiment tests are made in an indoor environment (home), where the obtained results have proved the effectiveness of the realized system.},

An approach that is getting more and more attention in the IoT ecosystem is the edge-computing and one of its fundamental pieces of equipment is the edge-computing gateway (GTW), which can working as a data-processing device nearer to the things and as a bridge to the Internet, as well. The most important features for these GTWs must be robustness and efficiency and a very popular solution is to use low-cost Raspberry Pi card-size computers. Considering protocol solution, Message Queue Telemetry Transport (MQTT) communication protocol has been considered one of the most applicable to IoT because of its low-power capability. In this context, this paper describes a study about the performance evaluation of a low-power member of the Raspberry Pi family, the Raspberry Pi Zero W, working as an IoT gateway and running MQTT. The experimental results show its performance using as metrics: the processor temperature, the CPU usage level, and rate of MQTT received messages under different Quality of Services (QoS).},

  abstract={The advent of future 5th Generation (5G) use cases, such as ultra-dense networking and ultra-low latency propelled by Smart Cities and IoT projects will demand revolutionary network infrastructures. The need for low latency, high bandwidth, scalability, ubiquitous access and support for IoT resource-constrained devices are some of the prominent issues that networks have to face to support future 5G use cases, which arise since current wireless and mobile infrastructures are not able to fulfill. In particular, the pervasiveness and high-density of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) at urban centers, together with their growing capacity and evolving standards, can be leveraged to support such demand. We argue that the integration of key 5G cornerstone technologies, such as Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and softwarization, fill some of the abovementioned gaps in regards to proper WLAN management and service orchestration. In this paper, we present a solution for slicing WLAN infrastructures, aiming to provide differentiated services on top of the same substrate through customized, isolated and independent digital building blocks. Through this proposal, we aim at efficiently handling ultra-dense networking 5G use cases to achieve benefits at unprecedented levels. Towards this goal, we present proof of concept realised over a real testbed and assess its feasibility.},

In this direction, we propose a mobile sensor network using the public transportation system. To validate the feasibility of our proposal, we start by evaluating the performance of important commercial sensors in a mobile scenario, comparing measurements of static and mobile sensors of temperature, humidity, barometric pressure and luminosity.

  abstract={Since the invention of electrical energy, their consumption increased over time and nowadays, with electric cars and smart cities, the demand for electrical energy increased exponentially as the energy should be on 24/7, not only in the daylight as was in the past. Generally, electric cars transport people daily, and at night, connected to battery chargers fed by the AC mains. These revolutionary lifestyles are changing the electric demand. Nowadays we have found different ways to generate electrical energy (hydroelectric, thermoelectric, aeolian, solar); many of these central generations are far from consumer and use transmission lines to connect that, and transformers are used for almost all of that to increase or decrease voltage/current. Transformers are composed of three elements in their construction: copper winding, magnetic core, and oil. The oil used as insulation material for winding also cools down the device, transferring the heat from winding and magnetic core to the outside through the metal structure and circulating it by the convection process. In this work, we characterized the mineral oil voltage breakdown (BD) at room temperature as liquid insulators in transformers. On the pulsed condition, we reached a dielectric strength of order of 27.5 kV/mm, while under alternate current AC conditions, the dielectric strength was only around 5 kV/mm, testing with the same pair of electrodes. With the pulsed testing, the BD has a higher value due to less stress on the material than the AC 60 Hz continuous voltage application.},

  abstract={Heterogeneous Vehicular Networks (HetVNETs) are an evolution of the traditional Vehicular Networks (VANETs) that integrate long-term and short-term communications technologies to deliver strategic services for roads and smart cities (for example, Intelligent Transport, Safety Notification, Multimedia Content, and others). Despite the recent evolution of HetVNETs, points related to security, data integrity and privacy are still open issues, since there is no standard to achieve trust among the network nodes. A promising approach to achieve trust is the usage of a reputation system, that monitors the behavior of network nodes to determine its trustworthiness. However, this de-termination is complex, because the uncertainty coming from the HetVNETs features, such as fast mobile nodes, self-organization, unstable communication links and frequently changing topology. Within this context, this paper presents a reputation system for HetVNETs, called TrustV, to perform a faster and reliable determination of network nodes trustworthiness based on game theory, as well as the long-term and short-term communication technologies of HetVNETs. The game theory approach allows TrustV to overcome the uncertain issues of HetVNETs, since the modeling of the cooperation as a game can identify selfish and malicious nodes during the time. The results suggest that the TrustV achieves a very high cooperation rate between vehicles at Het VNETs, even as it is capable to detect selfish and malicious nodes as well as black hole and grey hole attacks.},

  abstract={Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) have a strategic goal to achieve service delivery in roads and smart cities, considering the integration and communication between vehicles, sensors and fixed road-side components (routers, gateways and services). VANETs have singular characteristics such as fast mobile nodes, self-organization, distributed network and frequently changing topology. Despite the recent evolution of VANETs, security, data integrity and users privacy information are major concerns, since attacks prevention is still open issue. One of the most dangerous attacks in VANETs is the Sybil, which forges false identities in the network to disrupt compromise the communication between the network nodes. Sybil attacks affect the service delivery related to road safety, traffic congestion, multimedia entertainment and others. Thus, VANETs claim for security mechanism to prevent Sybil attacks. Within this context, this paper proposes a mechanism, called SyDVELM, to detect Sybil attacks in VANETs based on artificial intelligence techniques. The SyDVELM mechanism uses Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) with occasional features of vehicular nodes, minimizing the identification time, maximizing the detection accuracy and improving the scalability. The results suggest that the suitability of SyDVELM mechanism to mitigate Sybil attacks and to maintain the service delivery in VANETs.},

  pages={752-758},
  abstract={Currently, there is a wide variety of low-cost radio technologies being used to enable wireless communication in some important emerging applications such as smart grids, smart cities and the Internet of Things (IoT). However, easy access to these new radio technologies brings a security problem due to the fact that it is very easy for a malicious user to perform passive wireless signal scanning on these networks and use this information to launch identity-based attacks. In this paper, we propose a new machine learning based strategy to detect spoofing attacks in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Based on detailed analytical models for the mobile radio channel, the proposed algorithm combines two classifiers to process and analyze the instant samples of received signal strength to detect attacks. The algorithm is optimized for scenarios where the legitimate node and the attacking node are at the same distance or at a very close distance from each other in relation to the landmark, what is the worst case scenario. The results show that the proposed strategy improves the performance of the attack detection in about 10% regarding a similar approach in the literature.},

  abstract={LoRaWAN is an Internet of Things (IoT) technology with super usability due to its ability to support low-power and long-range communications. However, implementation and optimization require path-loss (PL) modeling to estimate network coverage and performance. In this context, the LoRaWAN radio channel is investigated for uplink and downlink in the 915-MHz band. Extensive measurement campaigns were conducted outdoors in suburban locations of Belém, specifically in the neighborhoods of Pedreira and Marco. Based on empirical results, PL models are developed for LoRaWAN communications in uplink and downlink are compared to widely used empirical models. In addition, coverage, shading regions, SNR analysis, and percentage received packets are based on real measurements. The results show that the proposed PL models are accurate, easy to implement, and applied in similar regions for LoRa network planning in suburban smart cities.},

  abstract={The Internet of Drones (IoD) refers to a robust mobile network with well-defined airways where drones perform interoperable services, enhancing the deployment of Smart Cities. Automatic Drone Identification (ADI) is a protection mechanism to detect and avoid malicious drones, where different techniques have been used, such as acoustic signals. In this field, the sound generated by propellers and motors has particular characteristics, being a potential aspect to explore; however, this investigation is still missing. This study examines the use of rhythm-based descriptors as input features to ADI, based on the hypothesis that the acoustic signal generated by different drones has different rhythmic properties. Aiming to explore and validate our approach, we formulate an ADI methodology using rhythm-based features. We use a freely available drone audio dataset, comparing our results with a baseline study. As a result, our classification model improves 3.47% the baseline binary classification and 2.97% the multiclass classification, reaching accuracy rates of 0.9985 and 0.9591, respectively. Although the improvements are narrow, they point out that acoustic features have a great potential to enhance ADI mainly in dense drone-based environments, where drone identification is an essential task.},

  abstract={The next generation of smart cities will rely on Intelligent Transport Systems (ITSs) due to the increased complexity and dynamism of traffic caused by continuous urbanization and population growth. The traditional techniques to deal with these challenges are expensive and have a great impact on people's lives and, in this scenario, the introduction of computational and technological solutions is necessary. In order to minimize the problems caused by congestion in urban centers, we present Let Me Know, a traffic management system inspired by the communication among vehicles that allows the request and availability of information related to vehicular traffic. The vehicles request information in order to update a distributed database containing momentary analyzes of road traffic. Through extensive performance analysis, we show our system's ability to reduce traffic congestion with a low impact on the network.},

  abstract={The increasing reliance on Systems-of-Systems (SoS) across critical domains, such as emergency response, healthcare, and smart cities, underscores the need for reliable architectures capable of seamlessly accommodating new SoS missions that emerge at runtime. Designing reliable SoS architectures faces challenges in predicting emergent behaviors due to incomplete understanding of Constituent Systems (CS) behaviors at design time, dynamic changes in requirements, and environmental influences. At the same time, it lacks solutions for automatically generating SoS architectural reconfigurations at runtime. The main contribution of this paper is to present an approach named AUTONOMOUS that can automatically generate SoS architectural configurations. AUTONOMOUS refers to a process for functional suitability that extracts information from SoS mission models, engineers a model generator, and finally generates the architectural configurations. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach through a case study in the space domain. Results demonstrate success in generating SoS architectural configurations, indicating that AUTONOMOUS could be further explored as a mechanism to reconfigure SoS architectures automatically at runtime.},

  abstract={Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) will be part of last-mile 5G/6G networks and will support Internet of Things (IoT) and low latency services in Flying Edge Computing (FEC). UAVs will densely populate aerial space in smart cities, providing networking and computing to interactive and monitoring services to ground users. FEC is composed of one or a set of UAVs, can cover large areas, and assure the quick deployment of services in 5G/6G systems. FEC will cooperate or even replace edge computing services on the ground network in case of congestion/failure events. However, the efficient selection and orchestration of UAVs to provide Quality of Service (QoS) to mobile users on the ground space is still challenging. This paper proposes a mobility-aware FEC orchestration scheme, called FLYED. FLYED enables UAVs to provide FEC with mobility and QoS support on ground space. Simulation results show the impact and benefits of FLYED in providing QoS assurance compared to state-of-the-art algorithms.},

  number={},
  pages={113705-113725},
  abstract={This work proposes a flexible and comprehensive Internet of Things (IoT) architecture designed for application on smart campuses to build their smart infrastructure and facilitate their transition to becoming smart. The concept of a smart campus is derived from the concept of a smart city, which was developed to demonstrate how urban areas were addressing their new and dynamic challenges by integrating technology and data-driven decision-making. Although the concept of the smart campus was initially conceived to study the smart city in a less complex setting, over time, both concepts have evolved into distinct areas of inquiry, exhibiting unique characteristics and impacts. In general, a smart campus is a university campus where information and communication technologies and IoT are applied to some or all the campus processes, thereby making these processes more efficient, cost-effective and environmentally sustainable for the institution, its members and the surrounding community. Additionally to presenting the proposal for a flexible and comprehensive architecture for a smart campus, this paper also demonstrates its interpretation for implementation on a Brazilian campus transitioning to become smart, the Institute of Science and Technology, Sorocaba (ICTS) - campus of the São Paulo State University (Unesp) in Sorocaba, Brazil. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is a scarcity of existing works which address this level of detail when proposing an IoT architecture for a smart campus. The implementation of this architecture has demonstrated that it can be successfully deployed using only open-source technologies. Furthermore, it has been shown that anyone with access to the campus website can access most of the data collected and stored on the system.},

  abstract={By monitoring crime incidence with quantitative techniques, many studies have shown that it is possible to improve decision making through pattern recognition and prediction. In a smart city scenario, such approaches can be used to compose analytical background to improve resource allocation. This work presents a novel framework to improve patrol planning that precisely provides places and times that are likely to be more dangerous than short-term average using a portfolio of machine learning algorithms. Our approach follows an algorithm-as-a-service architecture (AaaS), providing insights to existing public safety systems and platforms. The service comprises the broader ROTA framework, a robust public safety platform devised for the ongoing smart cities initiative of Natal, Brazil. Results of an experimental evaluation provided insights about spatial granularity effects on the performance of the estimators adopted. Furthermore, an evaluation on algorithm selection demonstrates its outcomes on the hotspot detection task.},

  abstract={This paper describes the development of a wireless Drone charge station, navigation and control methodology using Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision, based on Commercial-Of-The-Shelf (COTS) equipment and a dedicated management software to “help” a single Drone or a swarm squadron operation in VLOS and BVLOS, over urban regions. The Concept of Smart Cities consider the Drone use for power line asset monitoring, homeland security, delivery of medicine and logistics, epidemiological control and environmental monitoring. Due the modular design of the aerial platform and the wireless charge station, the use of COTS equipment allows more flexibility in all processes and result in cost reduction as well as development process optimization, where the focus is on the system intearation. The wireless Drone charge station is a dedicated structure located at a strategic position within city limits, which is able to be used as communication relay, and to charge the Drones automatically via wireless, according the mission scope, increasing the Drone operation range over urban region. The sensors inside the wireless Drone charge station are loT devices for the collection of meteorological data, images, command / control Drones and data from the other Stations, through a dedicated Command and Control Situation Room. By utilizing a dedicated management software at the Situation room - called by SIGI software - the system can control the drone and the airspace, collect field data from sensors and process them in real time. The situational analysis makes it possible to the administrator to optimize resources (material and human) by improving the efficiency of resource allocation in these areas while providing the real time situational awareness. The Drone design is a quadcopter with Embedded Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision, defined as mission board, totally integrated with autopilot board and navigation sensors. A.I. and Computer vision are used to increase the Drone navigation precision, without a GPS-RTK/PPK device. In terms of mission requirements or customization, the Drone recognizes patterns and makes decisions according to each operational scope, e.g., visual identification of wireless charge stations, mosquito outbreaks, power lines assets in need of maintenance, swarm control for area saturation mapping and others. As described, this system focuses on a new concept of Smart Cities, the Drones as a Service Tool, to be employed in urban regions, helping the population in air mobility.},

This paper proposes a three-layer management system to support smart urban mobility with an emphasis on bus transportation. In Layer-1, we apply novel Big Data techniques to compute bus travel time and passenger demands in an efficient and economical way. Layer-2 contains two analytic components: network analysis of passenger transit patterns and causal relationship analysis for bus delays. The third layer provides decision support in an interactive visualization environment. The proposed system is developed and validated in cooperation with the city of Fortaleza in Brazil. The use of generally available urban transportation data makes our methodology adaptable and customizable for other cities.},

This demand is further amplified by the anticipated impacts of climate change and the complexities introduced by rapidly expanding urban populations. In this scenario, smart city initiatives have emerged as a pivotal strategy to address these challenges, leveraging innovative technologies and paradigms such as Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, and Data Science to improve the quality of urban life in a more sustainable way. Recently, research efforts in these domains have focused on creating systems that can adapt and respond to changing conditions, enabling greater adaptivity and responsiveness to the needs of urban landscapes. Therefore, this article provides a comprehensive survey of adaptive urban services within a smart city context. Through analyses of recent literature, we investigate the technological foundations that enable the adaptivity of urban services and explore their applications in various urban scenarios, including energy, mobility, emergency management, public safety, and waste management. This article also highlights the benefits of adopting adaptive urban services, such as improved traffic management, resilient emergency management, and enhanced citizen engagement, bringing an important contribution to this broad research area. Finally, we provide a discussion on current technology enablers and challenges and present an overview for future research directions on adaptive urban systems at the forefront of transforming cities into more intelligent ecosystems.},

  abstract={The video streaming services are already responsible for the majority of the Internet traffic. A good cloud-level architecture partially solves some issues related to the video streaming services. At the same time, however, it introduces new ones such as higher latency and core network congestion. In order to improve on this matter, this work proposes a multi-tier architecture composed of a set of services to video streaming in a fog computing environment. It also takes into consideration classified hierarchical tiers and the ETSI-NFV architecture. The main goal is to design and assess a reliable and high-quality multi-tier services architecture to be used in the Smart City environments. To this end, we introduced a set of video streaming services in the fog/cloud computing, and also proposed how these services may be used to improve the Quality of Experience (QoE) for end-users.},

  pages={1016-1020},
  abstract={When deploying large-scale machine learning models for smart city applications, such as image-based parking lot monitoring, data often must be sent to a central server to perform classification tasks. This is challenging for the city's infrastructure, where image-based applications require transmitting large volumes of data, necessitating complex network and hardware infrastructures to process the data. To address this issue in image-based parking space classification, we propose creating a robust ensemble of classifiers to serve as Teacher models. These Teacher models are distilled into lightweight and specialized Student models that can be deployed directly on edge devices. The knowledge is distilled to the Student models through pseudo-labeled samples generated by the Teacher model, which are utilized to fine-tune the Student models on the target scenario. Our results show that the Student models, with 26 times fewer parameters than the Teacher models, achieved an average accuracy of 96.6 % on the target test datasets, surpassing the Teacher models, which attained an average accuracy of 95.3 %.},

  abstract={Smoke detection in Internet of Things (IoT) environment is a primary component of early disaster-related event detection in smart cities. Recently, several smoke and fire detection methods are presented with reasonable accuracy and running time for normal IoT environment. However, these methods are unable to detect smoke in foggy IoT environment, which is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose an energy-efficient system based on deep convolutional neural networks for early smoke detection in both normal and foggy IoT environments. Our method takes advantage of VGG-16 architecture, considering its sensible stability between the accuracy and time efficiency for smoke detection compared to the other computationally expensive networks, such as GoogleNet and AlexNet. Experiments performed on benchmark smoke detection datasets and their results in terms of accuracy, false alarms rate, and efficiency reveal the better performance of our technique compared to state-of-the-art and verifies its applicability in smart cities for early detection of smoke in normal and foggy IoT environments.},

  abstract={Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) are key enablers for several applications such as smart agriculture and smart cities. Software Defined Wireless Sensor Networking (SDWSN) paradigm improves WSN resource sharing, flexibility, and management. Monitoring network performance is essential to network management and it also plays an important role in making better use of scarce resources. However, obtaining network performance metrics in WSN is not trivial due to energy and computational constraints on the WSN nodes. The main contribution of this paper is a performance monitoring module for IT-SDN, an SDWSN framework. This module collects information about the data packets transmitted, queue delay and available energy on the WSN nodes, and sends the information as requested by the controller. The results showed that the monitoring module neither impacts the delivery rate, delay and overhead of the network, nor the energy consumption of the node. Also, the data collected by the monitoring module is pretty similar to the real values.},

  pages={1195-1198},
  abstract={Cognitive Radio (CR) is considered a key enabler technology for applications that require high connectivity (e.g., Smart Cities and Internet of Things), mainly because of its spectrum sensing function. In this way, CRs can sense the spectrum environment to select the best available channel for communication and they can, potentially, use licensed spectrum bands as a Secondary User (SU). However, CR has to vacate the licensed spectrum band as soon as a Primary User (PU) intends to use the channel. In this way, one of the most challenging topics in CR is the PU arrival prediction. Therefore, this paper presents a real-data study case of PUs arrivals prediction using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) in CR. Herein, the Energy Detector (ED) is used to detect the presence of PUs. Our results show that the traditional method of combining the ED with the HMM may not be suitable in CR networks.},

  abstract={Frequency-Selective Surfaces (FSSs) are a promising tool for dealing with electromagnetic compatibility challenges in smart cities. While FSS prototypes demand a small investment, their characterization usually involves expensive radio frequency generators and analyzers. Here, we propose an FSS characterization setup based on Soft Defined Radio (SDR) technology as a low-cost alternative. To experimentally validate the proposed configuration, we employed it to characterize an example FSS in the 2.4 GHz band, comparing the results with those obtained using a signal generator and a spectrum analyzer. The setups provided a comparable performance, with maximum and mean squared transmission differences below 2 dB and 0.5 dB, respectively. Although slower and less sensitive, the SDR setup is portable and almost 50 times cheaper.},

  abstract={The developments in wireless sensor networks, mobile technology and cloud computing have been pushing forward the concept of intelligent or smart cities, and each day smarter infrastructures are being developed with the aim of enhancing the well-being of citizens. These advances in technology can provide considerable benefits for the diverse components of smart cities including smart health which can be seen as the facet of smart cities dedicated to healthcare. A considerable defy that stills requiring appropriate responses is the development of mechanisms to detect health issues in patients from the very beginning. In this work, we propose a novel solution for indoor patient monitoring for medical purposes. The output of our solution will consist of a report containing the patterns of room occupation by the patient inside her/his home during a certain period of time. This report will allow health care professionals to detect changes on the behavior of the patient that can be interpreted as early signs of any health related issue. The proposed solution was implemented in an Android smartphone and tested in a real scenario. To assess our solution, 400 measurements divided into 10 experiments were performed, reaching a total of 391 correct detections which corresponds to an average effectiveness of 97.75%.},

  abstract={Smart city environments, when applied to healthcare, improve the quality of people's lives, enabling, for instance, disease prediction and treatment monitoring. In medical settings, case prioritization is of great importance, with beneficial outcomes both in terms of patient health and physicians' daily work. Recommender systems are an alternative to automatically integrate the data generated in such environments with predictive models and recommend actions, content, or services. The data produced by smart devices are accurate and reliable for predictive and decision-making contexts. This study main purpose is to assist patients and doctors in the early detection of disease or prediction of postoperative worsening through constant monitoring. To achieve this objective, this study proposes an architecture for recommender systems applied to healthcare, which can prioritize emergency cases. The architecture brings an ensemble approach for prediction, which adopts multiple Machine Learning algorithms. The methodology used to carry out the study followed three steps. First, a systematic literature mapping, second, the construction and development of the architecture, and third, the evaluation through two case studies. The results demonstrated the feasibility of the proposal. The predictions are promising and adherent to the application context for accurate datasets with a low amount of noises or missing values.},

  abstract={The maturation of Wireless Visual Sensor Networks (WVSN) in the last years, with new communication technologies and continuous releasing of embedded hardware development platforms, has significantly enlarged the number and relevance of visual monitoring applications, better supporting smart city and Internet of Things initiatives. However, there are still several challenges to be addressed, especially when visual sensors are used for critical monitoring. When availability issues are addressed in WVSN, different metrics and algorithms can be employed, but such approaches are usually focused on a single coverage goal. Actually, some monitoring applications may want to simultaneously optimize coverage over targets and areas alike, which requires an appropriate perception of the level of availability of the application at any given time. In this context, this article proposes a new availability metric for WVSN, considering that all targets and areas should be optimally and simultaneously covered by the cameras. In addition, optimization algorithms are proposed and compared, aiming at improving the availability of applications when rotatable visual sensors are employed.},

  abstract={Assuring an efficient Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous Internet of Things services is a challenge, mainly due to spectrum scarcity and bandwidth limitations on the radio access network. To solve these problems, efficient management of airtime per station (STA) is necessary. In this work, we propose a scheduler to perform dynamic network slicing in IEEE 802.11ah Networks. The proposed scheduler is based on virtualization technologies to assure QoS restrictions per slice and can be deployed in the Access Point (AP) or in a virtual machine connected to the AP. Network metrics are used to verify QoS violations per slice over time. Once a QoS restriction is detected, the scheduler performs a reallocation of resources re-configuring the Restricted Access Windows parameters that compose a slice, adjusting airtime per STA. To evaluate the proposed scheduler, we consider a dynamic policy. Simulation results in a smart city scenario show that the dynamic policy is able to scale the network and satisfies QoS slice requirements.},

  abstract={Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have significantly improved transportation quality by using applications capable of monitoring, managing, and improving the transportation system. However, the large number of devices required to provide data to ITS applications has become a challenge in recent years, particularly the high installation and maintenance costs made broad deployment impracticable. Despite several advances in smart city research and the internet of things (IoT), research on ITS is still in the early stages. In this sense, to improve data collection and maintenance strategies for ITS systems, this article proposes a virtual infrastructure model based on data reuse, mainly autonomous vehicle (AV) data, to support ITS applications. It presents design choices and challenges for deploying a virtual infrastructure based on Beyond 5G (B5G) communication and data reuse, followed by developing a proof of concept of an AV data acquisition system evaluated through simulation. The results show that the extra data collection module results in a 1.1% increase in total memory usage with direct sensor collection and a 2.6% increase with application performance management (APM) data collection on the reference hardware. This data reuse setup can significantly improve ITS data challenges with minimal impact on current technology stack on the Autonomous vehicles currently in circulation.},

  abstract={The utilization of edge computing has proven beneficial to Smart City applications due to its low latency processing on servers located in close proximity or even on the edge device. On the other hand, cloud computing leverages centralized computing power, resulting in significant advantages. Applications employing deep learning models commonly use both cloud computing and edge computing. While edge computing excels in providing rapid response times, devices typically possess limited computational resources. Conversely, cloud computing offers substantial computational power but suffers from longer access latencies. The challenge arises when deep learning applications must address one of these constraints, leading to poor scalability when focusing solely on edge or cloud computing or selecting a fixed distribution model. In this context, this paper aims to demonstrate the adaptive distribution of load leveraging osmotic computing. This approach directly impacts the scalability of deep learning solutions, mitigating the limitations imposed by either edge or cloud computing, improving throughput by up to 29% with low latency variation.},

  abstract={RDF is being increasingly considered in a broad range of information management scenarios. Governments, large corporations, startups, and other organizations around the world are using RDF as a data model to represent and share knowledge. However, there is still a long evolutionary track with multiple challenges for RDF reaching the scale of the most recent Big Data intensive applications (e.g., Smart Cities, Sensor Networks, eHealth, Internet of Things). In this survey, we review the usage of NoSQL databases to the storage of large RDF graphs by rehearsing the latest surveys and expanding their findings by updating proposals and bringing light to aspects such as model mapping between RDF and NoSQL, triple indexing and partitioning, graph fragmentation and data caching. Moreover, we explain how the surveyed works extended the RDF capabilities so the datasets can benefit of the characteristics of scalability, schemaless data, and better overall performance of NoSQL databases. The survey summarizes the current state of art, discusses open problems, and proposes a Reference Architecture (RA). For the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey where the focus is solely on papers that use one or more NoSQL systems for the RDF persistence.},

  abstract={The Internet of Things (IoT) networks are vulnerable to various kinds of attacks, being the sinkhole attack one of the most destructive since it prevents communication among network devices. In general, existing solutions are not effective to provide protection and security against attacks sinkhole on IoT, and they also introduce high consumption of resources de memory, storage and processing. Further, they do not consider the impact of device mobility, which in essential in urban scenarios, like smart cities. This paper proposes an intrusion detection system, called INTI (Intrusion detection of SiNkhole attacks on 6LoWPAN for InterneT of ThIngs), to identify sinkhole attacks on the routing services in IoT. Moreover, INTI aims to mitigate adverse effects found in IDS that disturb its performance, like false positive and negative, as well as the high resource cost. The system combines watchdog, reputation and trust strategies for detection of attackers by analyzing the behavior of devices. Results show the INTI performance and its effectiveness in terms of attack detection rate, number of false positives and false negatives.},

  abstract={In the last few years, novel approaches for using blockchain to solve Internet of Things (IoT) security and dependability issues have been proposed. Currently, different solutions were applied to Smart Homes, Smart Cities, Smart Grids, Supply Chains, Industry, and Vehicular Networks scenarios. Despite of that, the main advantages on the adoption of different architectures, models and algorithms proposed in the state of art of blockchain in IoT scenarios are not yet clear. This paper presents some discussion about the usage of blockchain technology in IoT environments and proposes a layer model of blockchains for IoT. In addition, we present an overview of the latest research regarding network architectures, consensus algorithms, data management, and applications. Finally, this paper presents open issues and future trends about blockchain in IoT.},
