 abstract = {This work proposes an embedded system that opportunistically detects free on-street parking by using surveillance cameras. Intelligent boards are embedded in the cameras allowing a distributed processing and communication. The task of looking for free parking spaces demands a significant amount of drivers׳ time. This problem generally takes place in urban areas where there is a large number of vehicles and few available parking spaces (on-street or off-street). Decreasing the time spent in this task could reduce the traffic jam or, in an extreme perspective, alleviate the toxic gases emission or the fossil combustible consumption. Initially, it was evaluated three classical techniques for image processing applied to detect free on-street parking. The best one presents a success detection rate close to 100%. After that, it was evaluated the performance of the embedded system by using only the best image processing technique. This performance evaluation considers three different scenarios: centralized, hybrid, and embedded. The last one is the main proposal and contribution. The results reveal that embedded proposal had an average requisition time of 2.10s vs. 0.38s of centralized one. The hybrid one presents the worst results.},

Bots can invalidate many existing services, which makes it crucial to understand the main forms of attacks and to seek defense mechanisms. This work presents a wide characterization of the behavior of bots on Twitter. From a real data set containing 19,115 bots, several characteristics of bots were identified, extracted from behavior and writing patterns, that have discriminative power. From these features, we present an automatic detection method capable to detect 92\% of the bots while only less than 1\% of real users are misclassified.},

Urban barriers represent dangers for the blind users. The dynamism of smart cities promotes a constant change of these dangers and therefore a potentially “dangerous territory” for these users. Previous work demonstrated that redundant solutions in smart environments complemented by human computation could provide a reliable and trustful data source for a new generation of blind navigation systems. We propose and discuss a modular architecture, which interacts with environmental sensors to gather information and process the acquired data with advanced algorithms empowered by human computation. The gathered metadata should enable the creation of “happy maps” that are delivered to blind users through a previously developed navigation system. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.},

Recent improvements in multimedia over VANETs allow drivers, passengers, and rescue teams to capture, share, and access on-road multimedia services. Vehicles can cooperate with each other to transmit live flows of traffic accidents or disasters and provide drivers, passengers, and rescue teams rich visual information about a monitored area. Since humans will watch the videos, their distribution must be done by considering the provided Quality of Experience (QoE) even in multi-hop, multi-path, and dynamic environments. This article introduces an application framework to handle this kind of services and a routing protocol, the DBD (Distributed Beaconless Dissemination), that enhances the dissemination of live video flows on multimedia highway VANETs. DBD uses a backbone-based approach to create and maintain persistent and high quality routes during the video delivery in opportunistic Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) scenarios. It also improves the performance of the IEEE 802.11p MAC layer, by solving the Spurious Forwarding (SF) problem, while increasing the packet delivery ratio and reducing the forwarding delay. Performance evaluation results show the benefits of DBD compared to existing works in forwarding videos over VANETs, where main objective and subjective QoE results are measured. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Technologies based on renewable sources for power generation, such as solar and wind, have emerged as an alternative for these sectors. With the development of distributed generation technologies, such as photovoltaic cells, wind turbines, and so on, it is necessary to identify and classify the disturbances that embedded electronic systems in these technologies may cause on distributed grids. This paper presents some data collected and analyzed on the Smart City Búzios project, where were installed three small wind turbines and solar photovoltaic systems in different grid points. This work presents and discusses some data collected on these systems regarding harmonic analysis. In the remaining of this paper is discussed data related to: vertical wind turbines, photovoltaic system for charging electric vehicles, photovoltaic system feeding computerized command center and photovoltaic system powering LED lamps in public area.},

 abstract = {Once Online Social Networks became popular in the last decade, people tend to spend a fair amount of time in the virtual world. As a consequence, real encounters, especially with non-related people tend to not be encouraged or even exciting anymore. Aware that mobile devices become more popular and powerful considering pervasiveness and ubiquitousness, we strategically decided to use technology in order to support and promote people gathering in public spaces. In this paper, we present Selfie Cafe, an Urban Computing application for leveraging socialization. The application was deployed in the wild to see how people would react to it in specific places where socialization would be expected but was not happening. Results of the Selfie Cafe installation show that it helped setting a more playful mood in the place, an increase in the time spent by people in there as well as supporting interactions among locals, acquaintances and strangers.

However, it is important to manage these data in an integrated way, enabling the exchange of information between existing fields and assisting in the decision-making process. Moreover, there's no way to tell how this data will need to be processed since each application may require it to be available obeying specific processes. Thus, this paper describes the design and implementation of a platform that aims to integrate, process and make available data streams from heterogeneous sources. It also defines an extensible data processing flow, which makes the creation of new processes for existing data and the inclusion of new types of data easier. Finally, a case study was conducted, which used a parking lot as scenario and assessed some important aspects related to platform implementation. © 2015 ACM.},

 abstract = {Currently, Systems-of-Systems (SoS) have performed an important role in diverse application domains, with representative examples in airport, military, and smart-cities, including crisis/emergency management. SoS refer to complex software-intensive systems, resulted from interoperability of independent constituent systems, performing new missions that could not be performed by any constituents working separately. For these critical systems, their quality is undoubtedly essential. However, in general, there is a lack of studies that discuss how quality has been addressed in such systems. The main contribution of this paper is to present an experience of establishing a quality model (i.e., a set of quality characteristics/attributes, subcharacteristics, and metrics) for SoS, in particular, for the crisis/emergent management domain. This quality model is based on ISO/IEC 25010 and it has also proved to be an important support to evaluate a system of this domain, however their construction must be performed with caution. Experience such as presented in this work could be repeated in other domains, contributing to improve the quality of a diversity of critical, complex SoS that are currently being built.

This work presents a decentralized algorithm for detecting damage in structures by using a WSAN. As key characteristics, beyond presenting a fully decentralized (in-network) and collaborative approach for detecting damage in structures, our algorithm makes use of cooperative information fusion for calculating a damage coefficient. We conducted experiments for evaluating the algorithm in terms of its accuracy and efficient use of the constrained WSAN resources. We found that our collaborative and information fusion-based approach ensures the accuracy of our algorithm and that it can answer promptly to stimuli (1.091 s), triggering actuators. Moreover, for 100 nodes or less in the WSAN, the communication overhead of our algorithm is tolerable and the WSAN running our algorithm, operating system and protocols can last as long as 468 days. © 2015 IEEE.},

The opportunistic networks in these scenarios are composed of disconnections, network partitions, high delay and strong influence of human mobility. To cope with these challenges, social-inspired approaches have been proposed considering the structure of networks and personal user features, however, limited studies have explored temporal variations of features and influence of exogenous variables, disregarding adaptive forwarding policies recommended for dynamic scenarios. In this paper, we address these challenges while investigating both, the temperature and the season calendar, as environmental features able to model the behavior of users' mobility and peer contacts. The results showed distinct social and spatiotemporal features characterized by thermal conditions able to affect the network performance. We also identified critical points of temperature able to provide early signals about the network changes. Finally, our results indicate that environmental data are crucial information towards the design of the next generation opportunistic mobile networks. © 2016 IEEE.},

Our work explores another side of this problem: how the environment can transmit data about itself to safely-help guide blind orientation in this environment? In other words, from our view, the environment must report data on its structure as opposed to make the blind person try to extract these data from this environment. So, here we propose to use an intelligent semaphore system (traffic lights) to communicate with a mobile system carried by the blind person and by the coherent processing of the signals sent and received between the mobile device and the intelligent semaphore, to conduct the blind in the streets crossing the crosswalk safely. © 2016 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, we are in the century of cities: there are more people living in the cities than in the countryside. In general, overpopulated cities around the world have common problems in several areas, such as city administration, education, health care, public safety, transportation, utilities, etc. In the particular case of Brazil, one of the major problems of cities is the high level of violence. This paper describes how the Brazilian city of Natal is implementing technological systems in the context of public safety to transform itself into a smart city, as a cooperation between university and government secretariat. More specifically, the paper presents ROTA, a smart city platform aiming at contributing to improve public safety. We also hereby describe a robust, scalable mobile application that fulfills the communication gap between control room and field personnel, as well as a Web dashboard intended to support data analysis and statistics about occurrences. © 2016 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Smart cities initiatives have been subject of discussion in various forums throughout the world. This innovation in urban infrastructure of cities and the impacts of intensive application of technology are still being identified and mapped. A fundamental aspect under technological viewpoint to make this novelty a reality, and most comprehensive as possible is related to communication networks. Concept of Internet of Things (IoT) only materializes through a combination of technologies based on private and public networks and the Internet as the main platform. Utilities companies have already started their participation in this process in sense that they are deploying smart grids using technologies like RF Mesh and PLC, being RF Mesh the most widespread in world markets. But it is necessary to insert smart grid projects in the context of smart cities and in its converging alternatives of communications infrastructure. This work explores an emerging technology named as Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) and proposes that this is the current alternative best suited to the big scenario of IoT, in which smart grids are included, and also compares with the RF Mesh technology widely adopted for this application. © 2016 IEEE.},

 booktitle = {{IEEE International Smart Cities Conference}},

 pages = {1--6}, 
 abstract = {Bike share systems have been implemented in many cities to provide an alternative low-cost environmentally friendly and healthy public transportation. Citizens can pick up and drop off bikes among stations around the city. The system may be used for both work-related and leisure purposes including supporting last-mile transportation and tourism. In order to sustain and attract more users into the bike system, understanding demand and trip patterns is a key objective. Further, due to the asymmetric and dynamic nature of user demands, some stations tend to run out of bikes whereas other stations tend to be full (impeding returns). Rebalancing stations to provide high quality services to fit pick up and drop off demand is a major challenge in bike share systems. In this paper, we present a three-layer SMARTBIKE system to assist city administrators in Fortaleza, Brazil with bike share system decision making. This is an international cooperative effort between academia and government to aid in building a Smart City. The first layer of the proposed tool includes ¿-means clustering technology to understand the true demand of the city bike share system. We designed a novel station network analysis in the second layer to provide insights on system usage patterns and to help with the rebalancing strategy. The third layer provides rebalancing support at the facility and operation level. Finally, we discuss a dynamic visualization tool to support decision making. © 2016 IEEE.},

This requires smart transportation management that allows urban planners to evaluate the impact of their policies and design targeted interventions. This paper proposes a three-layer management system to support smart urban mobility with an emphasis on bus transportation. In Layer-1, we apply novel Big Data techniques to compute bus travel time and passenger demands in an efficient and economical way. Layer-2 contains two analytic components: network analysis of passenger transit patterns and causal relationship analysis for bus delays. The third layer provides decision support in an interactive visualization environment. The proposed system is developed and validated in cooperation with the city of Fortaleza in Brazil.

In this direction, we propose a mobile sensor network using the public transportation system. To validate the feasibility of our proposal, we start by evaluating the performance of important commercial sensors in a mobile scenario, comparing measurements of static and mobile sensors of temperature, humidity, barometric pressure and luminosity.

 abstract = {As a result of rural and suburban migration to the cities, urban life has become a significant challenge for citizens and mayors, imposing a huge concern in the sustainable use of resources like energy, water, transportation and housing. Smart cities are the biggest bet to address these challenges efficiently through a real-time monitoring approach which aims to assist in intelligent planning and sustainable urban development. However, to accomplish this monitoring efficiently and to enable the sustainable use of resources, it is necessary an integration between citizens, city devices and the platform where the data is stored and processed. In this context, we are proposing the 3LES model (3 Levels of Energy Saving for Smart Cities), a model that combines data from citizens, city devices and nodes from the processing plataform to offer a multilevel energy saving proposal. 3LES must act transparently without affecting the quality of the services already offered in the city. This paper presents the components of management and monitoring of power consumption at various levels, as well as a model that monitors the energy consumption of elastic cloud applications. The results are promising, with a model that allows the estimation of the energy consumption of elastic applications based on CPU and memory traces with an average and median precision of 97.15% and 97.72%. In addition, we obtained a reduction of more than 90% in the energy spent in public lighting in the city of Rome when analyzing the citizens' location. © 2016 IEEE.},

One key concern is that the number of vehicles continuously increases faster than the available infrastructure, as well as the traffic congestion is a difficult issue to deal with. Several solutions to Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have been proposed to identify congestion and re-route the vehicles afterwards. In this direction, this work introduces SPARTAN, a fully distributed ITS solution, which notifies drivers about congested areas through Vehicle-to-Vehicle communication and employs a real-time decision making mechanism used to reroute vehicles to avoid the congested areas. Simulation results show the effectiveness of SPARTAN in calculating new routes and disseminating them to vehicles that approaching a congestion area. As a consequence, SPARTAN reduces the travel time and the congestion time in urban scenarios when compared to existing approaches. © 2016 IEEE.},

 abstract = {The current Internet design falls short in scenarios characterized by intermittent connectivity and absence of supporting infrastructure. Pocket switched networking allows communication between portable handheld user devices in such environments through the store-carry-forward paradigm. This involves storing data in device memory, exploiting user movement to physically transport the data, and forwarding through available short-range wireless interfaces. In this regard, user devices can be leveraged as data mules for point-to-point communication in two main scenarios: (i) conveying data between major infrastructures in urban areas (e.g., transporting sensor data to gateways in smart cities); and (ii) extending wireless coverage to provide connectivity in developing regions (e.g., bridging user devices and remote Internet access points). User movement in such scenarios exhibit spatial locality, which is the preference to a geographical location than others. This feature influences the data transfer opportunities that exist between different sets of users. This paper investigates the impact of locality on routing in pocket switched networks by: (i) evaluating the performance of existing routing strategies for point-to-point communication over different degrees of locality; and (ii) providing insights towards enhancing routing performance for realizing the aforementioned application scenarios through locality awareness. © 2016 IEEE.},

Implementation of smart and adaptable public transportation is an important challenge in developing cities and newly industrialized economies where growth characteristics contribute to and can be impacted by factors like overcrowding and travel delays. In this paper, we focus on bus transportation, and present the design and implementation of a 3-layer web-based system for performance evaluation and decision support. This is part of a "Smart Cities"initiative, which is an international collaboration between academia and government. The first layer estimates fundamental indicators such as bus travel time and passenger demands by integrating heterogeneous data sources. A novel bus-stop network is then designed in the second layer, which enables the derivation of passenger patterns in public transit using network analysis. The third layer provides decision support by analyzing causal relationships between indicators. The proposed web-based system called SMARTBUS is being developed and validated with the city of Fortaleza in Brazil.

 abstract = {Modern cities are supported by many IT systems managed by distinct public and private agents. Such legacy systems are often incompatible since, in general, they use old, dependent and nonstandardised technologies. This results in an environment in which there is no interoperability among smart city systems, preventing richer and more interesting applications to be used by citizens, companies, and city administration. An alternative to solve the lack of interoperability is the adoption of a System-of- Systems (SoS) approach. A SoS is a set of independent and heterogeneous constituent systems that interoperate to accomplish a global mission. The collaboration among such constituent systems enables a SoS to offer new functionalities that cannot be provided by any of these systems working as individual entities. The goal of this paper is to propose SoS-centric middleware services to support the management and execution of SoS in Smart Cities environments in a dynamic, transparent and scalable way. The proposed services, once integrated into a smart city platform, support interoperability among different systems operating in a city. Moreover, this paper also presents a motivational case study to make it clear the issues that must be addressed when multiple independent systems are brought together to provide a new Smart City service or application. © 2016 Association for Computing Machinery.},

Such changes impact not only the urban mobility at big cities but also the urban life quality, which is directly affected by pollutant emissions and noise. In order to limit emission impacts on sensitive population (children, elderly people, for example), city managers can enforce bounds on emissions and noise pollution generated by the city traffic in specific regions defined by geographical boundaries. This paper aims to contribute to the challenge of managing urban noise by exploring and analyzing the data with a geofencing approach.

 abstract = {Smart control access to any service is at the very basis of any smart city project. Biometrics have been used as a solution for system access control, for many years now. However, the simple use of biometrics can not be considered as final and perfect solution. Most problems are related to the data transmission way between the medias, where the users require access and the servers where the biometric data, captured upon registration, are stored. In this paper, the use smart-cards is adopted as a possible effective yet efficient solution to this problem. Palm-prints have been used as a human identifier for a long time now. This biometric is considered one of the most reliable to distinguish a person from another as its unique yet stable over time. In this work, we propose an efficient implementation of palm-print verification on smart-cards. For this implementation, the matching is done on-card. Thus, the biometric characteristics are always kept in the owner’s card, guaranteeing the maximum security and privacy. In a first approach, the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) are improved using upward, downward, leftward and rightward translations of the matched palm-codes. However, after thorough analysis of the achieved results, we show that the proposed method introduces a significant increase in terms of execution time of the matching operation. In order to mitigate this impact, we augmented the proposed technique with an acceptance threshold verification, thus decreasing drastically the execution time of the matching operation, and yet achieving considerably low FAR and FRR. It is noteworthy to point out that these characteristics are at the basis of any access control successful usage. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

To that end, the study identifies and discusses important challenges that had to be tackled toward data quality, data categorization, and data integration, in order to perform this type of study in practice.

Since these systems are embedded in a critical and dynamic environment, it is really important to have an infrastructure that is capable of providing real-time environmental information. This paper discusses two research questions that arise from adaptive ubicomp systems: (i) what are the key requirements to provide a reliable WSN-based system (e.g. a river monitoring system)? and (ii) how can an adaptable and reliable WSN-based system be developed? This paper seeks to respond to the former question with the aid of the RESS standard platform. The latter question is answered by employing a generic approach for adaptation. The term “critical systems”, means that any error may result in the loss of human life. We devised the RESS standard after deploying the WSN-based river monitoring system in Brazil for five years. Our prototype underwent several trials, sometimes leading to failure or damage, before we came up with a more reliable solution, which is outlined in this article. Finally, while our RESS platform is policy-free, it is extensible/adaptable and hence can naturally be adapted to new policies.},

Due to the population growing rate, new issues are still arising, but technology can be used to address such issues and improve life quality in big cities. In that scenario, surveillance is a highly desired service and most governments are already using different types of devices to provide high levels of security. Wireless Visual Sensor Networks (WVSN) can be used to monitor every part of a city without the cost of running cables all over it. However, there must be an efficient way to gather all information collected by the sensors and cameras, with reduced energy consumption and average latency. This work proposes a new algorithm to position multiple mobile sinks in WVSN deployed along roads and streets. A relevance-based approach was designed to position sinks closer to source nodes with higher sensing relevance, since they are expected to transmit more data packets. The proposed algorithm can detect forbidden and disconnected zones, making sure sinks will be positioned in permitted areas, which makes this approach very suitable for realistic smart city applications. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

The proper deployment of these novel Internet services is imposing hard connectivity constraints, such as high transmission capacity, reliable communications, as well as an efficient control scheme capable of enabling an agile coordination of actions in large heterogeneous scenarios. In recent years, novel control schemes, such as the so-called Path Computation Element (PCE) has gained momentum in the network research community turning into real PCE implementations. Indeed, there is a wealth of studies assessing the PCE performance, clearly showing the potential benefits of decoupling routing control tasks from the forwarding nodes. Nevertheless, recognized the need for a control solution in IoT scenarios, there is not much published information analyzing PCE benefits in these loT scenarios. In this paper, we distill how the PCE may gracefully provide for service composition in an agile manner, handling the specific constraints and requirements found in loT scenarios. To this end, we propose a novel PCE strategy referred to as Service Oriented PCE (SPCE), which enables network-aware service composition. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In this regard, opportunistic networks (OppNets) present an economical means of collecting delay tolerant data from sensors to their respective gateways for providing various Smart City services. Due to the distributed nature of the network, encounter-based routing protocols achieve acceptable throughput by requiring nodes to exchange and update contact information on an encounter basis. Unfortunately, sufficient insight into the associated overhead is lacking in the literature. Hence, we contribute by modelling contact information overhead and investigating its impact on OppNet routing, particularly in terms of data exchange success and energy consumption on portable handheld devices. Our findings reveal that the expected contact information overhead in Smart City scenarios significantly reduces data exchange success and increases energy consumption on portable handheld devices, thereby threatening the feasibility of the technology. We address this issue by proposing an algorithm that can be incorporated into encounter-based routing protocols to reduce contact information overhead without compromising throughput. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm reduces the average contact information overhead, increases throughput and reduces average energy consumption. © 2017 by the authors.},

This raises concerns regarding excessive message transmission overhead and throughput degradations due to resource constraints and technological limitations associated with portable handheld user devices.

While pervasive devices such as smartphones and tablets contribute significantly to the scalability of OppNets, closely following human movement patterns and social structure introduces network characteristics that pose routing challenges. Our study on the impact of these characteristics reveals that existing routing protocols subject a key set of devices to higher resource consumption, to which their users may respond by withdrawing participation.

Based on concepts derived from the study, we suggest design guidelines for adapting applicable routing protocols to sensed data collection scenarios.

 abstract = {In apartments, houses and hotels, showers are by far the biggest consumers of water, responding to about 25% of the total volume consumed every month. When winter hits big cities and temperatures fall, the hot water consumption increases dramatically. Since end users often dispense cold water present in the pipelines until the heated water from the reservoirs is perceived in showers or other points of use, hotels and residential buildings are responsible for a considerable waste of treated water. Several solutions based on local hardware have been proposed to partially overcome this problem, but many of them try to reduce the waste of water at the expense of reducing the efficiency of the heating and recirculating systems. The age of the IoT has brought to the smart buildings new perspectives regarding to rational use of resources, providing savings and real comfort for users. This work proposes a smart water heating scheme, mediated by IoT technology, for large buildings in urban settings. The main goal is ensuring the minimal waste of water as well as energy economy in pumping and heating systems. The proposed automated solution is built from an open-source Asterisk-based IP-PBX on cloud computing technology. A complete experimental setup considering a residential building in the southeastern region of Brazil is implemented and tested.

This shift from traditional applications is possible due to the massive amount of heterogeneous devices that constitute the Internet of Things. To provide newly improved characteristics to these services, such as mobility support, high resilience, and low latency, an extension to the Cloud computing paradigm was created, called Fog computing, which brings processing and storage resources towards the edge of the network, in the vicinity of the Internet of Things environment. This scenario implies a higher complexity level needed to coordinate available resources and how applications and services use them. Although some solutions have been proposed for the Cloud, several characteristics differentiate the Cloud from the Fog, creating the need for new mechanisms for the coordination of resources, applications, and services in the Fog. This paper explains the challenges present in the Fog that call for new mechanisms to later propose an architecture to manage resources in the Fog using a hybrid approach. In the Internet of Things and South-Bound Fog Levels, a distributed management of applications and services is proposed applying choreography techniques to enable automated fast decision making. A centralized approach to orchestrate applications and services taking advantage of a global knowledge of the resources available in the network is suggested for the North-Bound Fog and Cloud Levels. © 2017 IEEE.},

We collected and characterized more than 9M tweets from the two biggest cities in Brazil, Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. We performed topic modeling using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation model to produce an unsupervised distribution of semantic topics over the stream of geo-located tweets as well as a distribution of words over those topics. We manually labeled and aggregated similar topics obtaining a total of 29 different topics across both cities. Results showed similarities in the majority of topics for both cities, reflecting similar interests and concerns among the population of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo. Nevertheless, some specific topics are more predominant in one of the cities. © 2017 IEEE.},

With the ascension of the so-called Smart Cities, many unexplored opportunities are brought up in this context. The present paper proposes a software architecture to be implemented in the context of Smart Cities. A platform for the research, simulation and implementation of route generation algorithms, that challenges the traditional models and that makes the best use of the technologies available today, such platform aims to function as an implementation of an Artificial Transportation System with the goal of suppressing the existent flaws and gaps in today's systems, be it for economic, environmental, sustainability, time-efficiency or even health related areas. The architecture's initial draft is explained and its results are presented and analysed.},

Discovering patterns and trends in this data provides improved insights for planning and decision making for smart city management, disaster management and other applications. However, exploratory analysis of spatial data is a challenge due to its huge size of spatial data. It is often unclear for the analyst what to see next during an analysis process, i.e., lack of guidance. To tackle this challenge, we develop GeoGuide, an interactive guidance approach for spatial data. GeoGuide captures the implicit feedback of analysts and exploits it to highlight potentially interesting analysis options. We discuss some real-world applications of GeoGuide.

 abstract = {Smart Cities is a world-wide initiative leading to better exploit the resources in a city in order to offer higher level services to people. In this context, urban computing is a process of acquisition, integration, and analysis of big and heterogeneous data generated by a diversity of sources in urban spaces, such as sensors, traffic devices, vehicles, buildings, and humans, to tackle the major issues that cities face, e.g. air pollution, increased energy consumption and traffic congestion. The majority of these information can be represented as graphs, such as the transportation network, in which places (nodes) are connected by some form of public transportation (edges). A vision of the "city of the future", or even the city of the present, rests on the integration of science and technology through information systems. This vision requires a re-thinking of the relationships between technology, government, city managers, business, academia and the research community. This position paper presents our views towards developing techniques for querying and evolving graph-modeled datasets based on user-defined constraints. Our focus is to show how these techniques can be applied to effectively retrieve urban data and have automated mechanisms that guarantee data consistency.},

 abstract = {The advent of future 5th Generation (5G) use cases, such as ultra-dense networking and ultra-low latency propelled by Smart Cities and IoT projects will demand revolutionary network infrastructures. The need for low latency, high bandwidth, scalability, ubiquitous access and support for IoT resource-constrained devices are some of the prominent issues that networks have to face to support future 5G use cases, which arise since current wireless and mobile infrastructures are not able to fulfill. In particular, the pervasiveness and high-density of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) at urban centers, together with their growing capacity and evolving standards, can be leveraged to support such demand. We argue that the integration of key 5G cornerstone technologies, such as Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and softwarization, fill some of the abovementioned gaps in regards to proper WLAN management and service orchestration. In this paper, we present a solution for slicing WLAN infrastructures, aiming to provide differentiated services on top of the same substrate through customized, isolated and independent digital building blocks. Through this proposal, we aim at efficiently handling ultra-dense networking 5G use cases to achieve benefits at unprecedented levels. Towards this goal, we present proof of concept realised over a real testbed and assess its feasibility. © 2017 IEEE.},

Sensors are coupled on a bicycle and connected to an Arduino and a Mobile Application. After this, the captured data are saved in a cloud database, displayed and analyzed through a Web Application. In this work, our methodology is organized in three main phases: (i) data collection of the surface in which the cyclist is traveling, and the ultrasonic distance sensor, to identify areas of risk based on the proximity of objects from bicycle, (ii) data analysis and data classification, using machine learning concepts and (iii) data visualization, using map views in a Web Application. This methodology allows the identification of injury risk situations to cyclists. The main contributions of this work are surfaces classification with data collected by the accelerometer and ultrasonic sensor generating useful information through simple data. Real experiments were conducted at Fortaleza (Ceara, Brazil) and Aracati (Ceara, Brazil). This work brings new perspectives to collaborative data collection for identification of injury risk situations to cyclists, since it can be used to suggest routes based on these risk indicators and offer a secure environment for cyclists. © 2017 IEEE.},

 pages = {49--54}, 
 abstract = {Current smart city scenarios are strongly related to the use of wireless communications for providing a ubiquitous and pervasive network. The used wireless network devices are nodes with several restrictions in terms of hardware, energy, and communication. Due to these limitations, the selection of the appropriated routing protocol represents an important task in order to seek an efficient network. Although the IPv6 Routing Protocol for Low-Power and Lossy Networks (RPL) is used in a great variety of smart city applications, recent studies have been identifying some drawbacks and limitations of this protocol. In this context, the Lightweight On-demand Ad hoc Distance-vector Routing Protocol (LOADng) can emerge as an important alternative to RPL. The LOADng is a reactive routing protocol continuously used and evaluated in various network scenarios, but its performance in a smart city network was not studied yet. Hence, this work presents a performance evaluation study considering the use of LOADng in a smart city scenario. The routing protocol was evaluated using different routing metrics aiming to define the most appropriated one for a smart city application. The LOADng and the various routing metrics described in the paper were evaluated considering the packet delivery ratio, latency, number of hops, spent energy per bit, and network energy consumption. The results express that LOADng can present an efficient performance in applications with constant periodical data messages, but it is decreased when the messages are sent sporadically. © 2017 IEEE.},

Different authors attempt to explain that phenomenon by arguing in different directions, alleging bad features, bad quality or lack investments from the cities organizing the contests, among other reasons. Evidence in academic research is mostly based on superficial research about the contests and interviews with organizers of these competitions. We wanted to gather quantitative data to measure the longevity of apps that eventually become abandoned, their perceived quality and the impact of the civic apps produced in these contests. In a case study of contests held by three big metropolitan cities in different countries, we surveyed a total of 122 apps that won prizes in 11 civic apps, from 2009 to 2015. We also interviewed organizers of the events to combine their perspective with our results.

Unlocking these networks for enhanced wireless access to select users and devices, through dynamically sharing the unused portion of hotspots bandwidth, is key to provide seamless connectivity. Far from providing just basic wireless connectivity, we argue that these WLANs can be efficiently exploited to cope with emerging applications in the context of smart cities, massive machine type communication, and cellular data offloading. We introduce an approach aimed at the efficient sharing of available WLANs resources, allowing applications of domestic or enterprise users to coexist with third-party applications. To achieve this goal, we go beyond existing solutions by proposing the virtualization of access networks to offer differentiated networking services in an isolated manner. However, commodity wireless access devices are low-cost and performance-constrained, in contrast to carrier-grade systems that are very costly by deploying high networking performance. For this paper, we focus on the suitability of our approach on the customer premises, by assessing key performance networking aspects of SDN-enabled commodity wireless access devices, to obtain a better perspective of their current limitations. © 2017 IEEE.},

In these urban centers, different methodologies are used in order to collect data and provide them to applications. These data come from several heterogeneous sources, thus there is an effort to integrate and standardize them before their use. Also, a significant amount of this data has spatio-temporal annotations, which may be used to analyze the city dynamics, such as the mobility flow. Due to these characteristics of the data generated in urban centers, and also the possibilities brought by their use and analyses, this work presents a novel approach to collect, integrate and perform some analysis tasks in mobility data from smart cities. Thus, the SMAFramework can analyze mobility patterns based on a Multi-Aspect Graph (MAG) data structure. To show the potential of the framework, it is proposed a method to analyze the saptio-temporal correlation between data from two different data sources in the same city. Real data collected from social media and a taxi system of the city of New York are used to evaluate this method. The obtained results allowed to understand some of the applicabilities of the framework and also provided some insights on how to use the framework to resolve specific problems when analyzing mobility in urban environments.},

Smart cities typically encompass several distributed systems engaged in complex relationships, including the integration and interaction with other systems towards providing new functionalities. However, these systems are highly heterogeneous, developed with different technologies and data formats, and owned by distinct organizations and agencies within the system, thereby challenging the development of value-added applications. A way of addressing these issues is by holistically viewing a smart city as a system-of-systems (SoS), a set of complex systems with their own purpose and collaborating with each other to fulfill common global missions. In this perspective, we herein discuss how smart city systems could be holistically viewed as a complex SoS. We also shed light on some challenges related to the development of this type of systems in the context of smart cities. © 2017 ACM.},

Using a model that contains the basic concepts of a smart city ensures such basic concepts will be approached during specification, besides facilitating communication among designers and allowing the evolution of a smart city to be followed. The International Cartographic Association (ICA) has developed a formal model for Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) using the Enterprise, Information, and Computation viewpoints of the Reference Model for Open Distributed Processing (RM-ODP) framework. Assuming that an SDI and volunteered geographic data (VGI) are key parts of a smart city, this study adapts ICA's formal model for SDI with basic concepts that a smart city must have. The adapted model was applied in the specification of the Enterprise viewpoint of a system to reduce traffic congestion.

Being able to simulate the execution of Smart Cities scenarios would be extremely beneficial for the advancement of the field. Such a simulator, like many others, would need to represent a large number of various agents (e.g. cars, hospitals, and gas pipelines). One possible approach for doing this in a computer system is to use the actor model as a programming paradigm so that each agent corresponds to an actor. The Erlang programming language is based on the actor model and is the most commonly used implementation of it.

Many studies in this topic focus on exploring single data sources, and, to tackle this limitation we propose the SMAFramework to collect and integrate urban mobility data from heterogeneous sources. In this work, we propose a methodology that enables the standardization of spatiotemporal annotated data from sources such as Sensor Networks, Vehicular Networks, Social Media and the Web over a single data model (i.e., a Multi-Aspect Graph) and perform different analyses, such as the identification of taxi demand. To show the potential of this framework, we built and assessed a tool to evaluate spatiotemporal correlation of urban data from different sources. Real data collected from social media and a taxi system of the city of New York are used to evaluate this method. The obtained results allowed us to understand some of the applicabilities of the SMAFramework and also provided some insights on how to use it to resolve specific problems when analyzing mobility in urban environments.

 abstract = {Smart cities is an emerging concept that allows the usage of technology to improve the quality and efficiency of services delivered to the population of a given city, considering a vast application domain. Some applications, like smart surveillance using Internet of Things sensors demand the transmission of high amounts of traffic with strict quality of service, what may not be available at all times. One solution to deal with this traffic overload is to implement the concept of resources sharing. Considering this context, in this article, a heterogeneous network scenario is considered to implement a multi-purpose real time video surveillance application which can be applied to both smart cities and military surveillance such as borderline security. The proposed solution considers three crucial aspects: the QoS requirements of the real time video application; the cost-benefit of the spectrum allocation; and the time constraints involved in a vertical handover operation to avoid interference. The main contribution of the article are: (I) inclusion of a multilevel resources broker in the Smart Cities architecture, (II) a QoS-enabled solution for video surveillance to provide borderline security, and (III) a low overhead control mechanism to avoid interfering with the legitimate network traffic. Results obtained via simulations show that after the proposed solution is implemented delay and jitter are kept below their specific thresholds and therefore the QoS is guaranteed considering the coexistence of up to 500 IoT sensors. Nearly 70% of the traffic is accommodated either in IEEE 802.11 or IEEE 802.22 networks, which offer relatively low cost resources. These results are also compared with two state of the art related works and show that the proposed solution performs better than the related work in the analyzed scenarios. Finally, with respect to the time constraints, the implementation of the proposed solution leads to fast vertical handover, attaining times up to 46% lower than the maximum allowed handover duration. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Three case-studies are presented, namely a classification of Brazilian cities in terms of their water utilities; district metered area creation to improve pressure control; and transient pressure signal analysis to identify burst pipes. In the three cases, this hybrid technique produces excellent results. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

In this paper, we examine the possibility of creating a delay-tolerant vehicular network in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, using the public transportation system as a data carrier. We evaluate the capacity of such a network by analyzing a large mobility dataset reporting GPS positions of 12,456 buses and 5,833 taxis during a 24-hour period.

On the other hand, there are open government data (OGD) that are open and free, and can be a first step from the current city evolution to SCs at a more affordable cost. However, these data are available in a decentralized way, in different formats and granularities. To date, the authors have not found any literature work that performs the centralization of OGDs on a single platform. The purpose of this paper is provide a centralized OGD platform. Design/methodology/approach: This work investigates the state-of-the-art literature from the OGD, establishes the research question, design and develop the platform for OGD and accomplish the validation of the platform. Findings: Through the validations of the platform, advantages were observed in relation to productivity gain for the development of solutions, in the SC context, using the proposed platform. Research limitations/implications: The data have been collected in a manual way but for future works, the authors will use the web-crawler for the collection of data. Practical implications: One town hall (Sorocaba) is interested in using the platform to analyze the data usage in the simple way and compare with the other nearby towns. Originality/value: It is a recent work in literature using OGD, and there is no work that centralizes the information about several town halls to provide comparison between them and improve the decision-making. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Notably, smart city applications are impaired by this policy, because they depend on cost-benefit technology to support the Internet of Things. This paper presents a method for forecasting the Internet demand based on public data obtained from the International Telecommunication Union, the World Bank, and government agencies, using Brazil as a case study. The information inputs are associated with the population growth, and with social and technological development. The prediction process uses statistic concepts and models to infer the relationship between input variables and the data bandwidth rate. The proposed methodology is not restricted to the prediction of the Internet demand and may also be used to estimate other concerns for developing countries, such as oil, energy, and water consumption. The method is compared with other time series analysis models. The results reveal that factors related to innovation and technology significantly impact the annual projection of the Internet demand. © 2013 IEEE.},

Visualizing, specifying, tracking and monitoring typical contexts involved in IoT-based applications are still challenging activities since context modeling remains a low level process that requires much human expertise. In this paper we propose a new context life cycle that involves context design and context tracking. We developed a context-aware management framework, where contexts are modeled as graphs and can be explicitly designed and their occurrences can be tracked down. We believe that this feature of designing and tracking context graphs may help developers, administrators, and end-users in harnessing the wealth of information generated by highly scalable IoT systems. © 2017 IEEE.},

In this paper, drive-by approaches are discussed as a form of mobile sensing, that offer a number of advantages over more traditional sensing approaches. It is shown that the physical properties of the urban environment that can be captured using drive-by sensing include ambient fluid, electromagnetic, urban envelope, photonic, and acoustic properties, which comprise the FEELS classification. In addition, the spatiotemporal variations of these phenomena are discussed as well as their implications on discrete-time sampling. The mobility patterns of sensor-hosting vehicles play a major role in drive-by sensing. Vehicles with scheduled trajectories, e.g., buses, and those with less predictable mobility patterns, e.g., taxis, are investigated for sensing efficacy in terms of spatial and temporal coverage. City Scanner is a drive-by approach with a modular sensing architecture, which enables cost-effective mass data acquisition on a multitude of city features. The City Scanner framework follows a centralized IoT regime to generate a near real-time visualization of sensed data. The sensing platform was mounted on top of garbage trucks and collected drive-by data for eight months in Cambridge, MA, USA. Acquired data were streamed to the cloud for processing and subsequent analyses. Based on a real-world application, we discuss and show the potential of using drive-by approaches to collect environmental data in urban areas using a variety of nondedicated land vehicles to optimize data collection in terms of spatiotemporal coverage. © 2014 IEEE.},

At the first level, sensing nodes collect and send data to the second level, consisting of fog nodes. The fog nodes pre-process and deliver data to the third level, the cloud infrastructure, which stores and makes data externally available. The fog infrastructure, on the other hand, discards defective data, compresses information, and provides secure access points between fog and cloud. To validate SensingBus, we build a prototype and perform experiments to stress the fog nodes. We verify that each one can accommodate at least 20 simultaneous sensing nodes, an adequate number to sense a city such as Rio de Janeiro. © 2014 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Big data are a key enabler for smart cities and local communities willing to offer more tailored services and resources to citizens. One of the biggest challenges in a long-running big data platform for smarter cities lies in the real capacity not only to drill into the data, but also, and most importantly, to leverage existing social and geographical ties between all main actors of local communities, which range from normal citizens and people to economy stakeholders, non-profit and social organizations, and government and administrative staff. The platform should let them use (and disclose) among themselves those pieces of information they do not want to publish globally (e.g., on Facebook and Google), but would be willing to share and interweave locally (e.g., through an easy-to-use community portal). In addition, if the advent of Web 2.0 technologies simplified both the consumption and the production of new contents (e.g., through highly interactive wiki-like pages), they considerably enable additive services. A notable example is the metering of the digital footprint and traces left by users as they interact with these platforms, useful to further enhance the user experience by providing automatically adapted mashups of local community services/data. We describe how to exploit these socio-technical aspects by integrating them in a new semantic-enabled big data platform specifically designed for the local community smart city scenario called LocalFocus. The article also reports some experimental results collected with a first in-the-field deployment of the LocalFocus in Imola, namely, the ImolaInRete community portal, which has already involved more than 800 citizens since its launch in January 2017. © 2018 IEEE.},

 abstract = {As a result of rural and suburban migration to the cities, urban life has become a significant challenge for citizens and, particularly, for city administrators who must manage the sustainable use of resources such as energy, water, and transportation. Smart cities are the biggest vision to efficiently address these challenges through a real-time monitoring, providing an intelligent planning and a sustainable urban development. However, to accomplish them we need a tightly integration among citizens, city devices, city administrators, and the data center platform where all data is stored, combined, and processed. In this context, we propose ElCity, a model that combines citizens and city devices data to enable an elastic multilevel management of energy consumption for a particular city. As design decision, this management must occur automatically without affecting the quality of already offered services. The main contribution of ElCity model concerns the exploration of the cloud elasticity concept in multiple target levels (smartphones from citizens, city devices involved in the public lightning, and data center nodes), turning on or off the resources on each level in accordance with their demands. In this way, this article presents the ElCity architecture, detailing its modules distributed along the three data sources, in addition to an experiment that uses city devices and citizens data from Rome to explore energy saving. The results are promising, with an Energy Monitor module that allows the estimation of the energy consumption of elastic applications based on CPU and memory traces with an average and median precision of 97.15 and 97.72 percent. Moreover, we proposed a reduction of more than 90 percent in the energy spent in public lightning in the city of Rome which was obtained thanks to an analysis of geolocation data from their citizens. © 2016 IEEE.},

However, easy access to these new radio technologies brings a security problem due to the fact that it is very easy for a malicious user to perform passive wireless signal scanning on these networks and use this information to launch identity-based attacks. In this paper, we propose a new machine learning based strategy to detect spoofing attacks in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). Based on detailed analytical models for the mobile radio channel, the proposed algorithm combines two classifiers to process and analyze the instant samples of received signal strength to detect attacks. The algorithm is optimized for scenarios where the legitimate node and the attacking node are at the same distance or at a very close distance from each other in relation to the landmark, what is the worst case scenario. The results show that the proposed strategy improves the performance of the attack detection in about 10% regarding a similar approach in the literature.},

Such applications have been proposed in several domains including health care, smart cities and agriculture. However, despite their increased adoption, deploying these applications in specific settings has been very challenging because of the complex static and dynamic variability of the physical devices such as sensors and actuators, the software application behavior and the environment in which the application is embedded. In this paper, we propose a modeling approach for IoT analytics based on learning embodied agents (i.e. situated agents). The approach involves: (i) a variability model of IoT embodied agents; (ii) feedback evaluative machine learning; and (iii) reconfiguration of a group of agents in accordance with environmental context. The proposed approach advances the state of the art in that it facilitates the development of Agent-based IoT applications by explicitly capturing their complex and dynamic variabilities and supporting their self-configuration based on an context-aware and machine learning-based approach. © 2018 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Efficient urban mobility proved to be a major challenge for smart cities. A better use of the urban traffic infrastructure is key in the effort of mitigating the effects of traffic congestion. Popular approaches range from classical control and optimization to multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). This paper follows the latter track. Challenges here are manifold. First, most of the literature assumes that either traffic lights learn (while drivers do not change their behaviors) or viceversa. Second, no matter what kind of class of learning agents is considered, their actions are highly coupled (thus making the learning task harder). Third, when both classes of agents co-learn, these learning tasks are of different nature (from the point of view of MARL). Finally, a microscopic modeling and simulation of the this problem is not trivial. Therefore, this paper not only proposes a co-learning approach in which agents act in a shared environment, but also argues that this task needs to be formulated asynchronously. Besides, driver agents are able to update the value of the available actions by receiving information from other drivers. Results show that the co-learning approach outperforms other policies in terms of average travel time of all vehicles. Moreover, when co-learning is used, a better distribution of the trips within the network is observed. © 2018 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Many technological areas have been affected by the appearance of the internet of Things (IoT). This phenomenon is happening because applications such as smart cities, smart grids, smart buildings, smart homes, industry, transportation, healthcare and surveillance are being adapted to a new paradigm for adaptability, modularity, heterogeneity, scalability, optimization and decentralization. In this sense, several IoT architectures are being proposed for the applications that are inserted in this new technological development, with the most recent approaches being based on the Software Defined Network (SDN). Therefore, to follow this technological development, there is a need to implement the applications of control systems in this new scenario, which imposes challenges to be overcome, such as nondeterministic networks, latency, jitter, bandwidth, packet loss and interoperability. The focus of this work is on how to combine Distributed Networked Control Systems (DNCS) and IoT to meet this new technological context. However, the first step to be taken is to define the topology of IoT-based Networked Control Systems (IoT-DNCS), then develop a suitable system architecture to make control systems via the Internet of Things possible. Therefore, this article aims to propose a problem formulation and a simple and general architecture for IoT-DNCS, specifying the function of each element of the system according to the topology of the problem, and the organization of them to implement the control loops between sensors, controllers and actuators. The architecture proposed in this paper serves as a starting point for studies on new strategies and structures for network and feedback control systems. © 2018 IEEE.},

The existing state-of-the-art schemes handling the security of EHRs have resulted in data being generally inaccessible to patients. These schemes struggle in providing the efficient balance between the data privacy, need for patients, and providers to regularly interact with data. Blockchain technology resolves the aforementioned issues because it shares the data in a decentralized and transactional fashion. This can be leveraged in the healthcare sector to maintain the balance between privacy and accessibility of EHRs. In this paper, we propose a Blockchain-based framework for efficient storage and maintenance of EHRs. This further provides the secure and efficient access to medical data by patients, providers, and third parties, while preserving the patient private information. The goals of this paper are to analyze how our proposed framework fulfills the needs of patients, providers, and third parties, and to understand how the framework maintains the privacy and security concerns in the healthcare 4.0. © 2018 IEEE.},

These applications require multimedia (mainly video) flows to be handled by the underlying network in an efficient and scalable way, as they expect to consume a massive data produced by billions of things. In view of this, we propose a dynamic multiuser session control plane which leverages 5G's support of Software-Defined Networking (SDN) substrate to advance beyond todays limited, per-flow IP-based communication systems. We handle such limitations by proposing CLASSICO, a Cross-LAyer Sdn SessIon COntrol architecture that exploits SDN to offload the flow streaming computation operations from the IoT cloud platform to the network edge, affording high timeliness and scalability for the IoT-cloudified system. CLASSICO dynamically builds Application Layer multiuser data sessions and maps them into enhanced group-enabled data paths featuring SDN replication at branching nodes. We applied our solution to multimedia-alike use case, and results show that CLASSICO outperforms typical SDN-enabled IoT systems in terms to Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) video metrics. © 2018 IEEE.},

Unlike existing TCP and UDP protocols, a new transport protocol is required to meet the specifications of a wireless sensor network. In order to guarantee the quality of service (QoS) in the communication medium, this work describes a new communication protocol, which aims to guarantee the delivery of packages. Such protocol uses a new transmission acknowledges system, providing higher reliability in peer-to-peer transmissions. With this method, it is shown that even without a network buffer, it is possible to achieve better reliability in harsh environments than others well-known methods.

Many of these transportations problems involve not only one-way deliveries, but also pickups, forming a set of routes with desired QoS such as maximum route length/time, delivery/pickup sequences and timewindows. In order to achieve all desired QoS, while minimizing routing distances, this problem can be seen as an extension of the challenging Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP), which is known to be NP-Hard. Computational intelligence strategies such as metaheuristics are often employed to find near-optimal solutions in short computational times.

However, accessing such history and finding patterns across the interrelated crime occurrences data are challenging tasks, particularly to underdevelopment countries.

 abstract = {Traffic Lights Signaling Optimization consists in optimizing traffic-light cycle using optimization algorithms. In this context, a traffic simulator can represent different road intersections and traffic lights and can calculate traffic quality measures. A solution to this problem can be encoded in a vector representing the time of each traffic light on the simulator and the objective functions are the traffic quality metrics. Since there are several metrics this problem can be defined as a many-objective optimization problem. In spite of the existence of several objective functions, the majority of the related work selects a small set, often two. This paper proposes a manyobjective optimization framework based on objective reduction to solve Traffic lights Signaling Optimization Problem. Here, twelve objective functions are used. To deal with the high number of metrics, objective reduction techniques are applied along a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. An experimental set is conducted to analyze if it possible to reduce the number of objective functions on the Traffic lights Signaling Optimization Problem and if this reduction enhances the performance of the optimization algorithm. © 2018 IEEE.},

Such devices enable the development of new applications capable of making cities more intelligent, providing improvements to society and urban infrastructure. As a result of the interaction between different applications, there is a large set of data, from which useful knowledge can be extracted. An important problem to be faced is the recurrent occurrence of arbovirus outbreaks in big cities with tropical climate. This research proposes an architecture capable of aggregating data from different types of IoT devices, and manipulating them using data analytics techniques to assist the surveillance of arbovirus outbreaks. As an example of case study, we present an exploratory analysis of climatology data and cases of arbovirus diseases in the city of Fortaleza, Ceará, Brazil, between the years of 2011 and 2017. © 2018 IEEE.},

This project did not aim at the analysis of sensor data, but only the tests with modules of radio frequency transmission working with microcontrollers.

The system covered in this article, called PetGyn, falls into this category. It is powerful enough to represent scenarios of changes in the structure of road networks and/or in the behavior of their elements (pathways, traffic lights, possible conversions, etc.) and for predicting road usage levels (volume and traffic speed). In addition, PetGyn's flexibility allows the employment of different traffic allocation models (system optimization, user equilibrium, etc.), various types of cost functions (from the classic BPR - Bureau of Public Roads - arc cost functions to non-separable and asymmetric functions) and the simulation of different behaviors for the road network components (blocking routes according to schedules/days, reversing the direction of traffic flows, allowing/forbidden parking along the lanes, among others). Since its conception, it was built in a modular way so that it can be easily adapted to the urban traffic particularities of any country. Unlike commercial systems in this area, PetGyn was developed under a free software philosophy and as a web-based system in order to favor collaborative work. Its usage allows the study of intervention projects for mediumsized metropolitan regions, contributing to identify possible improvements in urban mobility. © 2017 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Edge computing takes computation away from the Cloud closer to the physical world. Therefore, it reduces the cost of communication bandwidth between IoT devices and the Cloud. However, Edge computing imposes certain limitations in computation power because due to poor hardware capacity of the devices. This restriction may significantly affect the performance of the deployed applications, especially Smart City applications. This limitations also could be aggravated by unpredictable human behaviors wich will easily make the Edge computation node overloaded. Osmotic computing is a new IoT application programming paradigm that provides an opportunity to balance the workload between Edge and Cloud therefore to overcome the load imbalance problem of Smart City applications. To this end, we propose an Osmotic Execution Framework that leverages state-of-the-art microservices techniques to deploy and execute a Smart City application in a distributed environment including Edge and Cloud.

 abstract = {Open Government Data has been made available by public institutions in Brazil and the world, and can add value to various sectors of society. Open data is also linked to smart cities, and hence important in this context, as it is the first step towards public transparency. Despite the wide range of Open Government Data, interpreting such data sets is a non-trivial task, due to the massive amount of raw data. This stimulates the search for techniques and methodologies that allow the interpretation of implicit information and deduction of new knowledge. One of the approaches used for these tasks involves the use of data visualizations. In addition to data visualizations classically used in descriptive statistics for data analysis, such as line or bar charts, many web sites have been used map visualization techniques. This type of visualization is important, since visualization of georeferenced data combined with other types of information can aid its interpretation. However, for data visualization construction on maps, it is necessary that the objects to be visualized are georeferenced. There are standards for turning such data available, however they are diverse, which may make it difficult for a single tool to display views from different sources. This work aims to present a framework that defines data standards for constructing data visualizations on maps of various types. Based on this framework, a tool was implemented to facilitate the creation of different map views, both by developers of open data portals and by users who analyze such data. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

 abstract = {The rapid progress of urbanization creates great challenges for urban planners. These challenges include the environment, energy consumption, transport, and other areas. The massive amount of information generated everyday in urban environments allows more precise diagnostics of the problems and helps in the design of solutions. Since such sources of information are heterogeneous and involve a large amount of data, major computational challenges arise. The objective of this work is to propose techniques and methods that allow the integration and visualization of urban data from multiple heterogeneous sources, aiming to create tools for urban data analysis, focusing mainly on transportation and transit. We propose the Urban Transit Fingerprint visualization, in which the geometry, length and duration of travels within a city can be compared, and indicators of the relative eiciency between private (individual) and public (mass) transport can be assessed. Data from Belo Horizonte and São Paulo, Brazil, are analyzed using the proposed technique as case studies. Results show wide discrepancies in the efort a public transit user has to make for her mobility in various regions of each city, as compared with individual travel. These results help explaining the sharp drop in the number of transit users over the last years, thus calling on urban planners to devise public policies in the search for better solutions. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.},

 abstract = {There is increased interest in smart vehicles acting as both data consumers and producers in smart cities. Vehicles can use smart city data for decision-making, such as dynamic routing based on traffic conditions. Moreover, the multitude of embedded sensors in vehicles can collectively produce a rich data set of the urban landscape that can be used to provide a range of services. Key to the success of this vision is a scalable and private architecture for trusted data sharing. This paper proposes a framework called SpeedyChain, that leverages blockchain technology to allow smart vehicles to share their data while maintaining privacy, integrity, resilience, and non-repudiation in a decentralized and tamper-resistant manner. Differently from traditional blockchain usage (e.g., Bitcoin and Ethereum), the proposed framework uses a blockchain design that decouples the data stored in the transactions from the block header, thus allowing fast addition of data to the blocks.

 abstract = {Contemporary systems are increasingly complex, with both large codebases and constantly changing environments which make them challenging to develop, deploy and manage. We consider two recent efforts to tackle this complexity: Microservices and emergent software. Microservices have gained recent popularity in industry, in which monoliths of software are broken down into compositions of single-objective, end-to-end services running on HTTP which can be scaled out on cloud hosting systems. From the research community, the emergent systems concept demonstrates promise in using real-time learning to autonomously compose and optimise software systems from small building blocks, rapidly finding the best behavioural composition to match the current deployment conditions. We argue that emergent software and microservice architectures have strong potential for synergy in complex systems, offering mutually compatible lessons in dealing with complexity via scale-out design and real-time client-tailored behaviour. We explore self-designing microservices, built with emergent software, to demonstrate the complementary boundaries of both concepts-and how future intersections may offer novel architectures that lie at a compelling point between human- A nd machine-designed systems. We present the conceptual synergy and demonstrate a specific microservice architecture for a smart city example where scoped microservices are continually self-composed according to the demands of the applications and operating environment. For the purpose of reproducibility of the study, we make available all the code used in the evaluation of the proposed approach. © 2018 ACM.},

Data from these technologies are stored by various devices spread throughout the city and are available in open data portals, which can be used to improve essential services such as public transport and fed into platforms for visualization and analyses. Human and urban mobility analyses demonstrate that understanding movement patterns can assist governments in city’s decision-making process, as well as improve life quality of citizens. Aiming to enable mobility analysis in different cities, this work presents MODAL platform. This platform replicates mobility analyses and algorithms on databases of different cities using data obtained from open data portals. We assess the platform with a case study performing analyses of the transportation displacement within three different cities using complex network metrics. The results demonstrated the public transportation system efficiency showing regions of Chicago, Dubai and Taichung well served and regions which are key points to the transportation city interconnecting various areas. Moreover, we could evaluate how improved the transportation system would be by adding new lines or new transport system.

The task of adding, extending, or porting the smart city scenario to other cities can be very challenging due to the rigid structure of such existing systems. To address this issue, in this paper we investigate common programming constructors that can be used to leverage the construction of such dynamic, smart city systems in the mobility domain. We propose Mensageria, a framework based on both the Complex Event Processing data-streaming processing paradigm and relational database management systems, which can dynamically deploy new or extend existing smart city scenarios in near real-time and maintain an updated dataset for provenance purposes. Mensageria provides several real-time primitives, such as filter, join, and enrich, that can be used to integrate, process, and analyze the city entities data streams. We discuss the generality, performance, and limitations of the proposed constructs through a real-world case study that was used in the Olympic Games of Rio in 2016 to detect, in real-time, existing and new situations that could affect the city mobility infrastructure. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

However, it is still necessary to improve design methods so that they consider the citizens’ needs, and to integrate mobile technology with Internet of Things technology to promote the development of sustainable smart cities.

Among several strand offered by a smart city, the smart parking systems focus the transportation and parking of vehicles problems, providing intelligent solutions based on ICT technologies, and particularly artificial intelligence techniques. In this context, a cyber-physical system, based on multi-agent systems, was developed for an intelligent parking system for car and bicycles. This multi-agent based system consists of a community of distributed, intelligent and autonomous agents, representing the parking spots and drivers, which cooperate to reach their objectives. In such systems, the global system behaviour emerges from the interaction between these individual entities, being crucial the adoption of the proper cooperation protocols. This paper studies and compares possible approaches to solve consensus problems in such distributed smart parking systems, and particularly addressing the negotiation strategies. For this purpose, the Contract Net Protocol, the English auction and the Dutch auction negotiation strategies were implemented in an agent-based smart parking system using the JADE framework. The experimental results allowed to perform a comparative analysis, considering the satisfaction levels of the actors, the scalability and the negotiation time to decide which approach better fits with the smart parking problem. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

 abstract = {The software architecture community has played a crucial role in the development of mobile software. Many of the ideas used in the design of these systems came from traditional software architecture and those ideas have contributed to mobile computing becoming ubiquitous. Mobile applications in the context of smart cities are very challenging since they need to operate within the power, processor, and capacity limitations of mobile devices, the exacting demands of life critical smart city requirements, and the constantly changing and exposed environment which may not always be trusted. Since there are no widely accepted design models for this type of software, developers must resort to primitive design decisions to meet all the needs of these applications, which takes additional time and expertise. For this reason, this study aims to investigate the design process for mobile applications in the context of smart cities. In order to address the lack of verified information about designing mobile apps, we conducted a multi-case study with 9 applications from 4 different development groups to build a grounded theory. The applications were reverse engineered to expose the architecture of each application. Based on all the data, an initial grounded theory was constructed to explain how the selected design process produces an app with the desired characteristics. The resulting theory offers explanations for how software engineering teams design mobile apps for smart cities. This knowledge will serve as a basis to further understand the phenomena and advances towards more effective design and development process definitions. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

 abstract = {Wireless Sensor Networks are used to collect a large amount of data in the field and forward it to data collectors, which are also responsible to analyze such data for a particular purpose. However, the wireless communication is susceptible to noise and interference, which results in loss of information in the routes from the sensors to the data aggregators. In addition, the devices used in these networks have restrictions on their processing, storage, and communication capacity, which diminishes, even more, the reliability of the data delivery. Therefore, this work describes a new communication method named μNet, which aims to increase the delivery rate of packets in multi-hop WSN. Such approach is based on peer-to-peer control messages to ensure that the packet has been properly forwarded. Besides that, the μNet is designed to be compatible with constrained devices, reducing the size of headers of the protocols and the size of the network buffer. By comparing μNet with widely used WSN protocols, it is demonstrated that this approach results in better end-to-end reliability in networks susceptible to interference. © 2019},

This platform can improve the coverage of a sensor network and take advantage of opportunistic communication. Since this platform can be used for delay-constrained applications, we propose an algorithm to choose sensor sinks in the bus stops of a smart city that minimizes the maximum delay when delivering messages. We compare our solution with an optimal formulation and use real data, obtained in buses from Rio de Janeiro, as an input of our algorithm. Our experiments show that we can use approximately 16% of bus stops as sinks, having less than 10% of increase in the network maximum delay and no significant loss in the spatial coverage. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.},

In this work, we propose a novel control plane optimization, which leverages the support of the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) substrate so that it can advance beyond today’s IP-based communication systems, which reveals weaknesses (e.g. a limited performance and scalability) in delivering multimedia content through per-flow channels. An attempt is made to overcome these limitations by proposing CLASSICO, a Cross-LAyer Sdn SessIon COntrol approach that exploits the SDN substrate to offload the flow streaming network-computing task from the IoT cloud platform to selected SDN branching nodes, and hence ensures high timeliness and scalability for the IoT-cloud system as a whole. To achieve this, CLASSICO dynamically builds application-layer sessions, which comprise multiple participant members sharing same interested content, and connects them into optimal multiuser tree structures, whereby only selected branching nodes apply SDN replication function for quality-enhanced transport service. We applied CLASSICO to a multimedia use case, and the results show that it outperforms multicast-capable IoT systems in terms of Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Experience (QoE) video assessment metrics.},

This need becomes even more important and less obvious to supply when these data have discrepant events (i.e., outliers). Here we propose a method to explore the multiway nature of urban spaces data in outliers detection which includes three stages: (i) dimensionality reduction, where we model data as a 3rd-order tensor; from this reduction, we extract a set of latent factors to obtain the best fit for the next classification step; (ii) classification of latent factors, where the latent factors from the stage (i) are used to generate instances of similar events in monitoring smart urban spaces which result in high-quality clusters from the factorization; and (iii) combining steps (i) and (ii) to generate a refined urban space pattern identification model. We analyzed a real large-scale dataset with valuable data captured and streamed by urban sensors from 4 cities: Elda and Rois (Spain), Nuremberg (Germany), and Tallinn (Estonia). Our results allow us to conclude there is a kind of cyclic time patterns of urban sensing. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

The end goal is to leverage the use of city resources to improve the quality of life of its citizens. Achieving this goal, however, requires advanced support for the development and operation of applications in a complex and dynamic environment. Middleware platforms can provide an integrated infrastructure that enables solutions for smart cities by combining heterogeneous city devices and providing unified, high-level facilities for the development of applications and services. Although several smart city platforms have been proposed in the literature, there are still open research and development challenges related to their scalability, maintainability, interoperability, and reuse in the context of different cities, to name a few. Moreover, available platforms lack extensive scientific validation, which hinders a comparative analysis of their applicability. Aiming to close this gap, we propose InterSCity, a microservices-based, open-source, smart city platform that enables the collaborative development of large-scale systems, applications, and services for the cities of the future, contributing to turn them into truly smart cyber–physical environments. In this paper, we present the architecture of the InterSCity platform, followed by a comprehensive set of experiments that evaluate its scalability. The experiments were conducted using a smart city simulator to generate realistic workloads used to assess the platform in extreme conditions. The experimental results demonstrate that the platform can scale horizontally to handle the highly dynamic demands of a large smart city while maintaining low response times. The experiments also show the effectiveness of the technique used to generate synthetic workloads. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {Context: Emerging paradigms like Internet of Things and Smart Cities utilize advanced sensing and communication infrastructures, where heterogeneity is an inherited feature. Applications targeting such environments require adaptability and context-sensitivity to uncertain availability and failures in resources and their ad-hoc networks. Such heterogeneity is often hard to predict, making the deployment process a challenging task. Objective: This paper proposes GoalD as a goal-driven framework to support autonomous deployment of heterogeneous computational resources to fulfill requirements, seen as goals, and their correlated components on one hand, and the variability space of the hosting computing and sensing environment on the other hand. Method: GoalD comprises an offline and an online stage to fulfill autonomous deployment by leveraging the use of goals. Deployment configuration strategies arise from the variability structure of the Contextual Goal Model as an underlying structure to guide autonomous planning by selecting available as well as suitable resources at runtime. Results: We evaluate GoalD on an existing exemplar from the self-adaptive systems community, the Tele Assistance Service provided by Weyns and Calinescu [1]. Furthermore, we evaluate the scalability of GoalD on a repository consisting of 430,500 artifacts. The evaluation results demonstrate the usefulness and scalability of GoalD in planning the deployment of a system with thousands of components in a few milliseconds. Conclusion: GoalD is a framework to systematically tackle autonomous deployment in highly heterogeneous computing environments, partially unknown at design-time following a goal-oriented approach to achieve the user goals in a target environment. GoalD has demonstrated itself able to scale for deployment planning dealing with thousands of components in a few milliseconds. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

The smart cities offer strategic principles aligning to the three main dimensions integration of infrastructures and technology-mediated services, social learning for strengthening human infrastructure, and governance for institutional improvement and citizen engagement. A growing number of cities are implementing carsharing programs to increase this transportation model, and São Paulo (Brazil) is one of these cities around de world. That model provides the general public with affordable access to public car, and can promote the integration of public transport systems and carsharing programs to improve mobility, traffic and environment related problems. One of the key factors for the success of such programs is the location of car stations in relation to potential transport demand. This study proposes a GIS-based method to calculate the spatial distribution of the potential demand for trips, locate stations using location-allocation models, and determine the best location to settle car-sharing stations. The results obtained shows which are the best places for the implementation of carsharing and its possible partnerships with several types of commercial establishments in the city of São Paulo. © 2019 The Authors.

The emergence of the immense economic potential necessitates a robust authentication mechanism that needs to be lightweight and suitable for real-time applications. Moreover, the physical integrity of these devices cannot be assumed as these are designed to be deployed in an unattended environment with minimum human supervision. A user authentication mechanism for the IoT, in addition to guaranteeing user anonymity and un-traceability functionality requirements, must also be resistant to device physical capture and related misuses. In this paper, we present a novel lightweight anonymous user authentication protocol for the IoT environment by utilizing “cryptographic one-way hash function”, “physically unclonable function (PUF)” and “bitwise exclusive-OR (XOR)” operations. The broadly accepted Real-Or-Random (ROR) model-based formal security analysis, formal security verification using the automated software verification tool, namely “automated validation of internet security protocols and applications (AVISPA)” and also non-mathematical (informal) security analysis have been carried out on the proposed scheme. It is shown that the proposed scheme has the ability to resist various well-known attacks that are crucial for securing the IoT environment. Through a detailed comparative study, we show that the proposed scheme outperforms other existing related schemes in terms of computation and communication costs, and also security \& functionality features. Finally, a practical demonstration of the proposed scheme using the NS3 simulation has been provided for measuring various network performance parameters.},

 volume = {25}, 
 number = {1}, 
 year = {2019}, 
 pages = {}, 
 abstract = {Context: In contrast to traditional software systems that are mostly created from scratch, current software systems are engineered as a junction of systems already in operation. Examples can be found in domains, such as smart cities, crisis and emergency, IoT, big data, industry 4.0, and connected health systems. Most of them can be considered systems-of-systems (SoS), since they refer to alliances of operational and managerial independent software-intensive systems, which are sometimes distributed over different environments. Therefore, SoS software architectures must be dynamic, evolve over time, and support the execution of emergent behaviors to accomplish SoS missions. They must be also designed to enable the connection of heterogeneous systems, making possible their interoperation, communication, coordination, cooperation, and collaboration, most of the times, in a seamless way. Similar challenges have been addressed by using software mediators as architectural entities. However, the application of mediators in SoS has not been properly explored. Goal: This article introduces MediArch, a layered architecture that considers mediators as first-class software entities to be used in the construction of SoS architectures. Our objective is to present evidence about how MediArch’s can support the construction of SoS architectures. Methods: The following four steps were conducted to define MediArch: (1) identification of mediation requirements to allow SoS properties; (2) establishment and categorization of twelve types of mediators, for enabling capabilities of communication and control of constituent systems interactions and conversion of heterogeneous messages exchanged through a mediation infrastructure; (3) specification of duties, behaviors, assumptions, and guarantees of mediators; and (4) organization of MediArch in three layers, namely, the constituents \& consumer systems layer; the communication, conversion, \& coordination layer; and the control layer. This architecture was used as the backbone for the software architectures of two SoS in different domains, namely, flood monitoring system-of-systems (FMSoS), and health-care supportive home system-of-systems (HSH-SoS), for providing evidence on how MediArch supports the architecting process of SoS. Results: MediArch (1) supports the integration of independent constituent systems, (2) provides strategies to manage emergent behaviors, (3) defines different schemes of control authorities, (4) offers elements to support SoS evolution, and (5) promotes the resilience and adaptability of SoS architectures. Conclusions: Although MediArch contributes to the establishment of SoS architectures, some challenges related to performance, resource consumption, security, safety, and non-disruptive reconfigurations must still be overcome. © 2019, The Author(s).},

A prototype for services of security and quality of service has been implemented and its evaluation shows that virtualization of the access node does not impact the performance of virtual network functions.

 abstract = {Spatial concentrations (or spatial clusters) of moving objects, such as vehicles and humans, is a mobility pattern that is relevant to many applications. Fast detection of this pattern and its evolution, e.g., if the cluster is shrinking or growing, is useful in numerous scenarios, such as detecting the formation of traffic jams or detecting a fast dispersion of people in a music concert. On-Line detection of this pattern is a challenging task because it requires algorithms that are capable of continuously and efficiently processing the high volume of position updates in a timely manner. Currently, the majority of approaches for spatial cluster detection operate in batch mode, where moving objects location updates are recorded during time periods of a certain length and then batch-processed by an external routine, thus delaying the result of the cluster detection until the end of the time period. Further, they extensively use spatial data structures and operators, which can be troublesome to maintain or parallelize in on-line scenarios. To address these issues, in this paper we propose DG2CEP, a parallel algorithm that combines the well-known density-based clustering algorithm DBSCAN with the data stream processing paradigm Complex Event Processing (CEP) to achieve continuous and timely detection of spatial clusters. Our experiments with real-world data streams indicate that DG2CEP is able to detect the formation and dispersion of clusters with small latency while having higher similarity to DBSCAN than batch-based approaches. © 2019, The Author(s).},

This model allows the use of crowdsourcing techniques so that the management of cities resources is done by the citizens, without having to rely on an organization or public administration. To encourage participation in this resource management, this model also uses techniques of gamification. CORE-MM proposes the use of crowdsourcing integrated with gamification to manage the resources of a smart city, with two interdependent objectives: to motivate the use of the system by the users, and to encourage their participation in the sharing and management of information. The scientific contribution of this work is that CORE-MM treats the resource management considering a generic resources approach for smart cities. A prototype of CORE-MM was offered to volunteers and a questionnaire was developed to collect data and to evaluate the model, its performance and relevance. Results with volunteers indicated good perceived ease of use and good perceived utility. From the affirmations of the questionnaire that the 10 volunteers that tested the CORE-MM prototype had to answer, 91.67% agreed on the ease of use of the system and 8.33% manifested indifference in their responses. Regarding the utility of the system, 99.17% agreed and only 0.83% were indifferent. These results point to positive perspectives regarding the use of the application in possible situations and real locations. © 2019, IICM. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Historically, cities follow reactive planning models where managers make decisions as problems occur. On the other hand, the exponential growth of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) has allowed the connection of a diverse array of sensors, devices, systems, and objects. These objects can then generate data that can be transformed into information and used in a more efficient urban planning paradigm, one that allows decisions to be made before the occurrence of problems and emergencies. Therefore, this article aims to propose a platform capable of estimating the amount of carbon dioxide based on sensor readings in vehicles, indirectly contributing to a more proactive city planning based on the monitoring of vehicular pollution. Crowdsensing techniques and an On-Board Diagnostic (OBD-II) reader are used to extract data from vehicles in real time, which are then stored locally on the devices used to perform data collection. With the performed experiments, it was possible to extract information about the operation of the vehicles and their dynamics when moving in a city, providing valuable information that can support auxiliary tools for the management of urban centers. © 2019 by the author.},

 abstract = {LoRa Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN) has become popular as an Internet of Things (IoT) enabler. The low cost, ease of installation and the capacity of fine-tuning the parameters make this network a suitable candidate for the deployment of smart cities. In northern Sweden, in the smart region of Skellefteå, we have deployed a LoRaWAN to enable IoT applications to assist the lives of citizens. As Skellefteå has a subarctic climate, we investigate how the extreme changes in the weather happening during a year affect a real LoRaWAN deployment in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), Received Signal Strength Indication (RSSI) and the use of Spreading Factors (SFs) when Adaptive Data Rate (ADR) is enabled. Additionally, we evaluate two propagation models (Okumura-Hata and Irregular Terrain Model (ITM)) and verify if any of those models fit the measurements obtained from our real-life network. Our results regarding the weather impact show that cold weather improves the SNR while warm weather makes the sensors select lower SFs, to minimize the time-on-air. Regarding the tested propagation models, Okumura-Hata has the best fit to our data, while ITM tends to overestimate the RSSI values. © 2018 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

We used real data gathered and streamed by urban sensors from three cities in Finland, chosen during a continuous time interval: Helsinki, Tuusula, and Lohja. The results showed greater efficiency for the online method of detection of outliers when compared to the offline approach, in terms of accuracy between a range of 8.5% to 10% gain. We observed that online detection of outliers from real-time monitoring through the sliding window becomes a more adequate approach once it achieves better accuracy. © 2019 by the authors.

The recently published Bluetooth mesh profile specification addresses the most relevant challenges on that paradigm, adding secure multicast communications capabilities. A framework to create Smart Cities services was proposed and a traffic light service was used to demonstrate specification applicability for smart cities’ services.

In this context, this article proposes a public general-purpose platform for acquisition and visualization of vehicular speeds, which can then be exploited by any additional application. For that, a crowdsensing-based mobile software application was developed to collect instantaneous speeds provided by smartphone GPS, formatting and distributing this information to a database system. Such historical data can then be exported or visualized through a web-based comprehensive interface, which provides valuable data when planning traffic mobility in cities; for example, indicating areas with heavier traffic over a certain time period. Therefore, allowing the use of many different search filters and supporting data delivery in the JSON format, the CitySpeed platform can provide services not supported by popular applications, such as Waze and Google Maps, and potentially assist smart city initiatives in this area. © 2019 by the authors.},

Such a Knowledge Organization System would allow us to map in detail the complex interactions of the many processes, objects, and factors in the interdependent ecosystem. It would facilitate the application of artificial intelligence (AI). It would allow us to relate key human needs to available resources and to work towards a sustainable planet.

 abstract = {Applications for intelligent transportation systems are springing up to bring many benefits to users during their journey through the use of vehicle traffic monitoring. However, testing and experimenting with real-world environments still poses a challenge for these applications since a realistic scenario of mobility is required. Typically, simulation tools use mobility trails to construct the network topology based on the mathematical formulation of a city mobility model, which attempts to emulate the real mobility of a given city. Another strategy is to use the real route of vehicles traveling to generate the model of mobility of a certain city; however, many studies available in the literature do not use the entire flow of vehicles that circulate in the city, acquiring data only of a small group of vehicles. Thus, in this work we intend to develop an infrastructure that would allow the extraction of the information of mobility from the vehicles of the countryside cities, in real time. This enables not only real-time vehicle monitoring but also the generation of traceability of real-time mobility. The results showed low battery consumption, as well as a low amount of mobile data usage. © 2019 IEEE.},

 abstract = {With the development of smart cities, the demand for artificial intelligence (AI) based services grows exponentially. The existing works just focus on cloud- edge or edge-device cooperative AI which suffers low learning efficiency of AI, while edge-to-edge cooperative AI is still an unresolved issue. Moreover, the existing researches concentrate on the computation offloading of the AI-based task, ignoring that it is a brain-like task performing sophisticated processing to raw data, which leads to the high latency and low quality of the learning services. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an on-demand learning offloading mechanism for edge-to-edge cooperative AI. Firstly, the principle of the learning capability and its offloading are proposed for the formal description of the learning resources migration. Secondly, the proposed mechanism realizes the bilateral learning offloading utilizing edge-to-edge and cloud-edge collaborations to handle AI-based tasks with high learning efficiency and resource utilization rate. Moreover, we model the edge-to-edge learning offloading allocation based on the concatenation of deep neural network (DNN) subtasks and their heterogeneous requirement of learning resources. Simulation results indicate the rationality and efficiency of the proposed mechanism. © 2019 IEEE.},

 abstract = {The maturation of Wireless Visual Sensor Networks (WVSN) in the last years, with new communication technologies and continuous releasing of embedded hardware development platforms, has significantly enlarged the number and relevance of visual monitoring applications, better supporting smart city and Internet of Things initiatives. However, there are still several challenges to be addressed, especially when visual sensors are used for critical monitoring. When availability issues are addressed in WVSN, different metrics and algorithms can be employed, but such approaches are usually focused on a single coverage goal. Actually, some monitoring applications may want to simultaneously optimize coverage over targets and areas alike, which requires an appropriate perception of the level of availability of the application at any given time. In this context, this article proposes a new availability metric for WVSN, considering that all targets and areas should be optimally and simultaneously covered by the cameras. In addition, optimization algorithms are proposed and compared, aiming at improving the availability of applications when rotatable visual sensors are employed. © 2019 IEEE.},

 abstract = {The constant increase in the number of vehicles, the lack of road traffic management and the technological limitations of traffic light control devices, contribute to increasing congestion, environmental and noise pollution. The applications involving the Internet of Things (IoT) concept have been growing around the world. Concerning the problems found in cities with large populations, the IoT applications aim technological solutions that improve the population living conditions. Most traffic light controller systems are locally programmed. In this case, to control all traffic lights in a city, besides to be a slow task, it is not possible to determine the traffic light's operating state. In some cases a centralized control is used, allowing information exchange with all traffic lights on the network. This paper seeks to study and develop a traffic light controller electronic circuit, with centralized control topology, able to communicate with other wireless network traffic lights. All characteristics of the designed circuit were evaluated by practical system control and monitoring tests. Finally, the electronic circuit proved to be viable in terms of smart cities applications. © 2019 IEEE.},

 abstract = {The increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is among the main problems faced by the growth of road transportation in Sao Paulo, the Brazilian city with the highest concentration of vehicles accounting for 28,000 vehicles per 100,000 inhabitants. Electric mobility has the potential to catalyze the development of transport, contributing to mitigate climate change, and support incipient smart cities projects with an adequate electric vehicle charging station (EVCS) network. This study comes up with the mapping of well-suited locations for EVCS by using geographic information system (GIS) analysis in combination with knowledge from a survey conducted with local electric vehicle (EV) experts. The method was tested to meet the increasing demand for EVs in the municipality of Sao Paulo by 2025, assuming the need for around 3,300 EVCS stations to support a penetration of 1 percent of EVs in urban private cars. EVCS is ideally situated in one third of the municipal districts of Sao Paulo, namely the Center, South Center, West and Southeast areas. Attributes such as unsafe non-urbanized areas and risk places subject to floods were highlighted as new findings to consider in Sao Paulo, with similar characteristics as others in Latin America areas, providing some insights about the challenges on the way to smart cities.},

The vast majority focuses on specific domains, typically presenting a sensor-acquisition architecture for processing in Cloud Computing. Most recent initiatives try to include Cloud Computing and Edge Computing, while few of them use the three computing levels (Cloud, Fog, and Edge). Besides, many of these platforms do not define the services that should be deployed at each level, nor how the developer can better use each feature. This work fulfills this gap presenting an architecture for applications classifying services implemented by a typical Computing Environment of Smart Cities. Our architecture uses all the computational levels (Cloud, Fog, Edge) of a city infrastructure, and it defines how to deploy each type of service at each level.

 abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is pushing the Internet to the next level, bringing the number of connected devices to an unprecedented amount, creating new services and improving old services like the metering system. The advanced meter infrastructure (AMI) measures, collects and analyzes the distribution and consumption of utilities such as water, electricity, and gas, which are of vital importance for the implementation of smart cities. In this paper, we employ LoRa, which is a low power wide area network technology (LPWAN), for the communication of meter devices and network server, and we study the coexistence of two kinds of messages: regular and alarm events. Our focus is on the analysis of the alarm events, which can be characterized by emergency situations and require ultra-reliability. We investigated the feasibility of the alarms for a smart metering scenario through simulation campaigns and a mathematical model. By assigning a different spreading factor (SF) to the device depending on whether the event is regular or alarm, we assessed the system performance. We evaluate the availability, reliability, and quantity of alarms that satisfy the restricted requirements of alarms events and do not compromise the performance of regular events. The best performance for regular events at SF-7 was obtained when alarm events are allocated to SF-8, whereas the other combinations are affected for a stronger interference. © 2019 IEEE.},

Examples of smart city services are traffic efficiency, security, surveillance, localization, healthcare services, infrastructure support among others. Any of these services will be able to get information from their users and from the network through our model, once an important issue in smart city is the challenge to collect or deliver useful and processed data to stakeholders. In this proposal, the evaluation of the model was conducted through emulations on Mininet and POX controllers.

 abstract = {With mobile data growth and rapid urbanization trends, there will be an extremely high density of wireless communication links in cities, therefore users expect an environment where they can access the Internet to their devices anytime, anywhere. Due to CAPEX/OPEX problems, a small cell deployment is not an economic strategy in scenarios of intense data traffic, so the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to improve network coverage and performance becomes feasible. In order to improve the Quality of Service of the network, a computational system was proposed to perform decision making that receives as input network information such as network throughput, packet loss rate, and delay, and returns the network quality for a specific type of network application. The system as a whole verifies the necessity or not of using UAVs to improve the quality of the network and the coverage of the area of highest demand. If UAVs are required, they are shifted to these areas. Otherwise, the UAVs remain in the base station. Through the proposed method there were significant improvements in the Quality of Service (QoS) of the network, allowing a reduction in packet loss ratio and delay, and an increase in the network throughput rate. © 2019 IEEE.},

 pages = {303--311}, 
 abstract = {Recently, Network Slicing in Radio Access Technologies (RATs) has been proposed as an approach to divide the wireless network infrastructure into isolated logical slices which are defined following their requirements and features in a service-driven way. To the best of our knowledge, the application of Network Slicing has not been explored in IEEE 802.11ah Networks. In this work, we propose a Virtual Network Slicing Broker (VNSB), a Virtual Network Function (VNF) instantiated inside a Software Defined Network (SDN) controller which communicates with an IEEE 802.11ah network Access Point (AP) via a southbound Application Program Interface (API). Based on information obtained by the northbound API, the slicing broker gets the information contained in the slicing templates, which describes the services features and respective Quality of Service (QoS) restrictions. With these data, the slicing broker makes logical slices in the context of the Restricted Access Windows (RAW) which are periodically sent by the AP to the stations (STA) via the Raw Parameter Set (RPS). Since there is no hardware with the IEEE 802.11ah standard available on the market, we validate the proposed solution through extensive simulations in a typical smart city scenario. Results showed the broker capacity to build and manage logical slices per service, respecting the QoS restrictions of each offered service. Moreover, the proposed slicing broker makes use of available resources of neighbor slices reducing delay, packet loss, and efficiently maximizing throughput per slice. © 2019 IEEE.},

Aiming at tackling challenges related to data heterogeneity while considering georeferenced information, this work introduces LGeoSIM, a semantic-based information model for smart cities as means of fostering interoperability and powerful automated reasoning upon unambiguous information. LGeoSIM relies on the recent NGSI-LD Specification, thereby encompassing the principles of Linked Data to allow semantically defining information through ontologies and their interconnection.

 abstract = {Automated license plate recognition (ALPR) technology is a powerful technology enabling more efficient and effective law enforcement, security, payment collection, and research. A common license plate standard was adopted by the member states of the Mercosur trading bloc (Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay) and consequently requires an upgrade to the ALPR software used by law enforcement and industry. Due to the scarcity of real license plate images, training state-of-the-art supervised detectors is unfeasible unless data augmentation techniques and synthetic training data are used. This paper presents an accurate and efficient automated Mercosur license plate detector using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained exclusively with synthetic imagery. In order to obtain the synthetic training data, Mercosur license plates were faithfully reproduced. Digital image processing techniques were employed to reduce the domain gap and a CNN with basic image manipulation was used to embed the artificial licensed plates in to realistic contexts. The trained model was then validated on real images captured from a parking lot and a publicly available traffic monitoring video stream. The results of experiments suggest detection accuracy of about 95% and an average running time of 40 milliseconds. © 2019 IEEE.},

In an emergency situation, mobile units such as police cars, fire trucks, and ambulances should move to the emergency location, thus performing an adequate care. A key question for achieving high performance in the service is to define and apply criteria to select and activate mobile units for each emergency situation. This paper presents an event-based protocol with event filtering by subscriber’s fitness, named Event to Most Suitable Subscribers (EMSS), by which the most appropriate mobile units are activated. A publish-subscribe middleware that implements the EMSS protocol was also developed. An application of the middleware to the police and the firefighter services is presented. The results show that, in the case where the most suitable mobile units are chosen, the service response time can be reduced. Therefore, the emergencies are more quickly attended, what is crucial for saving lives. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Thus, low-cost devices emerge as a cheap alternative that provides farmers with information on indoor air quality in its facilities. However, it is important that these devices make precise and accurate measurements, providing reliable concentration readings. Therefore, the objective of this study is the construction and validation of a low-cost system capable of measuring, storing and sending, via the mobile network, the concentrations of hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, carbon dioxide, PM2.5, PM10, temperature, and relative humidity. Preliminary inter-comparison tests showed that the built system had a reliable behavior in relation to all variables, even though the CO2 sensor was the one with the highest determination coefficient.

Since new types of sociotechnical relations can be established to increase gains and productivity in this context, considering technical, business and social dimensions, Software Ecosystems (SECO) emerge as a theoretical lens to study SoIS. We claim that the software ecosystem perspective can foster the comprehension about SoIS by exploring the existing relations among constituent ISs within a SoIS as well as the nature of such relations. The main contribution of this work is to offer a conceptual model to support SoIS analysis under a SECO perspective, rising the idea of EcoSoIS. Coding analysis was applied to extract the main concepts of SoIS and SECO from experts and to link these concepts to compose the conceptual model. Smart city was used as an example to illustrate how the model could be instantiated. Once the model enables a conformant representation of the smart city SoIS under a SECO lens, we believe that the model can be used for other SoIS. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Citizens and managers are also important stakeholders in these systems, as they provide data, provide and retrieve information and also manage the many systems that control the city infrastructures’. UML has been often considered for designing these types of systems, mostly with focus only on designing the software elements of the system. However, these infrastructures systems are composed of many more elements than software, including processes, constraints, sensors, networks, laws and further documents. SysML is a UML profile that has gained attention in past years, as SysML also models systems elements that are not software. In this paper, the main idea is to describe a SysML profile for modeling smart cities applications, which is useful as it specifies common elements of a city as native elements of system design. The profile, named SmartCitySysML, extended from SysML Requirements, Sequence and Block Definition diagrams in order to model system and software elements for smart cities. Design of a road traffic control system regarding a group of intersections is used as a case study. As a result, SmartCitySysML facilitates the use of common elements in smart city infrastructures and provides a visual representation to assess quality of diagrams from a practical point of view. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Since parking issues affect most of the citizens, it is hard to imagine future smart cities with efficient parking solutions. With the introduction of the Internet of things (IoT), objects are able to connect to the Internet and may collect data in real time. The potential of these data is enormous and may allow cities to move from estimates to concrete data, which enable precise predictive models to be created and improves urban area planning and scaling. For this reason, parking solutions would benefit from the introduction of the IoT concept of connecting everything. The paper overviews the most common parking solutions, analyzing their pros and cons. Then, it introduces an IoT-oriented smart parking system that can be deployed indoor and/or outdoor. With the proposed solution, drivers can remotely monitor the vacancy status of parking spots in real time through a mobile app (or even Web). Furthermore, the solution acts as a repeater, extending the wireless signal to parking slots that are distant from the primary access point. This solution is evaluated, demonstrated, and validated through a prototype, and it is ready for use. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.},

Considering the particularities of each, the approach embraces two concepts known as social machines and data artifacts. On the one hand, social machines act as wrappers over applications (e.g., social media) that allow citizens and things to have an active role in their cities by reporting events of common interest to the population, for example. On the other hand, data artifacts abstract citizens’ and things’ contributions in terms of who has done what, when, where, and why. For successful smart cities, the approach relies on the willingness and engagement of both citizens and things. Smart cities’ initiatives are embraced and not imposed. A case study along with a testbed that uses a real dataset about car-traffic accident in a state in Brazil demonstrate the technical doability and scalability of the approach. The evaluation consists of assessing the time to drill into the different generated data artifacts prior to generating useful details for decision makers. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.},

Despite increasing efforts to maximize the vehicle flow in large cities, to provide greater accuracy to estimate the traffic jam and to maximize the flow of vehicles in the transport infrastructure, without increasing the overhead of information on the control-related network, still consist in issues to be investigated. Therefore, using artificial intelligence method, we propose a solution of inter-vehicle communication for estimating the congestion level to maximize the vehicle traffic flow in the transport system, called TRAFFIC. For this, we modeled an ensemble of classifiers to estimate the congestion level using TRAFFIC. Hence, the ensemble classification is used as an input to the proposed dissemination mechanism, through which information is propagated between the vehicles. By comparing TRAFFIC with other studies in the literature, our solution has advanced the state of the art with new contributions as follows: (i) increase in the success rate for estimating the traffic congestion level; (ii) reduction in travel time, fuel consumption and CO2 emission of the vehicle; and (iii) high coverage rate with higher propagation of the message, maintaining a low packet transmission rate. © 2020},

Nevertheless, multiple concurrent sensing applications may have different levels of criticality according to the impact of the performed tasks for the protection of people’s integrity and thus they should be treated in different ways. This article then proposes a prioritization approach to guide the development of sensors-based applications in smart city scenarios, which will be differentiated based on their monitoring objectives, some contextual prioritization parameters and the detection of critical events. This approach will also define security mechanisms to ensure that all sensor nodes will follow the defined prioritization policies for the considered smart cities. Besides simulation results, the proposed definitions and mechanisms were completely implemented for additional validation, resulting in a set of codes to facilitate the construction of practical sensor applications based on the proposed approach.},

 abstract = {A Smart City can be defined as a high-tech city with several public and private services capable to strategically solve (or mitigate) problems normally generated by rapid urbanization. Different models of indicators have been developed to follow cities’ evolution to become a Smart City. An example of such model is the standard 37120 from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) that proposes a set of dimensions and indicators (e.g. Transportation, Recreation, Solid Waste) for services and quality of life for sustainable cities and communities. It has been common to find official social network profiles of organizations and governmental entities related to the services they provide or are responsible for (water, waste, transportation, cultural events, etc.) and that are used by citizens as a gateway to directly interact and communicate their complains and problems about those services. The present paper proposes to apply machine learning algorithms over the urban data generated by social networks in order to create classifiers to automatically categorize citizens messages according to the different cities services dimensions. For that, two distinct text datasets in Portuguese were collected from two social networks: Twitter (1,950 tweets) and Colab.re (65,066 posts). The texts were mapped according to the different ISO 37120 categories, preprocessed and mined through the use of 8 algorithms implemented in Scikit-Learn. Initial results pointed out the feasibility of the proposal with models achieving average F1-measures around 55% for F1-macro and 78% for F1-micro when using Linear Vector Classification, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree and Complement Naive Bayes. However, as the datasets were highly unbalanced, the performances of the models vary significantly for each ISO category, with the best results occurring for Wastewater, Water \& Sanitation, Energy and Transportation. The classifiers generated here can be integrated on a number of different city services and systems such as: governmental support decision systems, customer complain systems, communities dashboards, police offices, transportation’s companies, cultural producers, environmental agencies, and recyclers’ companies.},

In this paper, we discuss the need for fine-grained user access control for IoT smart devices. The inherently distributed nature of IoT environment necessitates the support of multi-authority attribute-based encryption (ABE) for the implementation of fine-grained access control. Therefore, we present a secure fine-grained user access control scheme for data usage in the IoT environment. The proposed scheme is a three-factor user access control scheme, which supports multi-authority ABE and it is highly scalable as both the ABE key size stored in the user’s smart card and ciphertext size needed for authentication request are constant with respect to the number of attributes. Through the formal and informal security analysis, we show that the proposed scheme is secure and robust against several potential attacks required in an IoT environment. Moreover, we demonstrate that the proposed scheme performs at par or better than existing schemes while providing greater functionality features.},

 abstract = {Currently, Internet applications running on mobile devices generate a massive amount of data that can be transmitted to a Cloud for processing. However, one fundamental limitation of a Cloud is the connectivity with end devices. Fog computing overcomes this limitation and supports the requirements of time-sensitive applications by distributing computation, communication, and storage services along the Cloud to Things (C2T) continuum, empowering potential new applications, such as smart cities, augmented reality (AR), and virtual reality (VR). However, the adoption of Fog-based computational resources and their integration with the Cloud introduces new challenges in resource management, which requires the implementation of new strategies to guarantee compliance with the quality of service (QoS) requirements of applications. In this context, one major question is how to map the QoS requirements of applications on Fog and Cloud resources. One possible approach is to discriminate the applications arriving at the Fog into Classes of Service (CoS). This paper thus introduces a set of CoS for Fog applications which includes, the QoS requirements that best characterize these Fog applications. Moreover, this paper proposes the implementation of a typical machine learning classification methodology to discriminate Fog computing applications as a function of their QoS requirements. Furthermore, the application of this methodology is illustrated in the assessment of classifiers in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and robustness to noise. The adoption of a methodology for machine learning-based classification constitutes a first step towards the definition of QoS provisioning mechanisms in Fog computing. Moreover, classifying Fog computing applications can facilitate the decision-making process for Fog scheduler. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

This increase is mainly due to the emergence of new technologies such as Big Data and Internet of Things (IoT). Some of the biggest challenges in applying these systems, relate to the processing, visualization, and analysis of the generated data, since most systems tend to work connected, thus generating a large mass of data that deviates from the standard of previously used systems. For data visualization, one of the main devices used is the reduction of dimensionality, in an attempt to bring data from one dimension N to two or three dimensions and thus be noticeable to human eyes. There are several algorithms used for dimensionality reduction, the linear ones that as the name implies, solve linearly separable problems and so these are very limited and the nonlinear ones, that solve more complex problems, but usually have an excessive runtime, making them or often inappropriate to apply. This article presents the parallel implementation of the nonlinear dimension reduction algorithm t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), showing better results than its conventional version in terms of runtime, thus showing that parallelism can make the problem of dimensionality reduction treatable, bringing greater scalability and delivering results within an acceptable time frame. © 2013 IEEE.},

VANETs support many applications related to safety, infotainment, and accident detection. The routing protocols are using for data communication in the presence of high mobility nodes and dynamic topologies. Due to high mobility and unpredictable topologies, the data communication becomes unreliable which causes data loss, delay, and link disconnections among vehicle nodes. To address these routing limitations, various types of routing protocols have developed. In all existing routing protocols types, geographic routing protocols are one of the efficient types due to its low overhead processes. Geographical routing protocols are able to handle vehicular environment constraints. However, with many advantages, geographic routing protocols are not considering many constraints of the vehicular environment. Geographical routing protocols should have well-defined routing metrics to deal with high mobility and other data loss and link disconnection issues. This research designs a Beaconless Traffic-Aware Geographical Routing Protocol (BTA-GRP) by considering traffic density, distance and direction for next forwarder node and route selection. The protocol is feasible for urban dense and sparse traffic conditions and addresses delay, disconnection and packet dropping issues. The proposed protocol has simulated with state of the art routing protocols. The simulation results indicated that the proposed protocol has higher performance in VANETs. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Smart city environments, when applied to healthcare, improve the quality of people's lives, enabling, for instance, disease prediction and treatment monitoring. In medical settings, case prioritization is of great importance, with beneficial outcomes both in terms of patient health and physicians' daily work. Recommender systems are an alternative to automatically integrate the data generated in such environments with predictive models and recommend actions, content, or services. The data produced by smart devices are accurate and reliable for predictive and decision-making contexts. This study main purpose is to assist patients and doctors in the early detection of disease or prediction of postoperative worsening through constant monitoring. To achieve this objective, this study proposes an architecture for recommender systems applied to healthcare, which can prioritize emergency cases. The architecture brings an ensemble approach for prediction, which adopts multiple Machine Learning algorithms. The methodology used to carry out the study followed three steps. First, a systematic literature mapping, second, the construction and development of the architecture, and third, the evaluation through two case studies. The results demonstrated the feasibility of the proposal. The predictions are promising and adherent to the application context for accurate datasets with a low amount of noises or missing values.},

Questions such as “How telecommunication operators will efficiently provide network infrastructure”, “When and where the quality of service parameters are degraded or below expected” are to be considered. In this context, the use of base stations carried by Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) acting as flying cells to compensate areas where telecommunications systems are challenged by abnormal conditions during their operation has attracted attention. In this paper, we propose an intelligent solution based on a novel multilayered cellular automata for positioning flying cells and improvement of network capacity in context heavy traffic situations as congested cars in avenues in some hours of the day, crowded events, disaster or hot spot traffic. In our distributed approach, all UAV base stations operate in parallel. The self-organisation arises from an emergent pattern based on applying simple rules in a defined neighbourhood. The proposed scheme considers both backhaul and radio access network constraints, and user requirements in terms of downlink throughput. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm performs favourably compared with other schemes in terms of all metrics considered. Therefore, we provide a solution for rapid and efficient positioning of multiple UAV base stations to respond in real time to urgent network changes.},

 abstract = {Large cities are increasingly investing in efficient mobility and sustainable transportation as an alternative to expensive and pollutant traditional vehicles. In parallel, people are also seeking cleaner and healthier options for short and last-mile distances. In order to cope with this trend, which has boosted the adoption of bikes in urban areas, a major concern of the governments has been to build bike paths and tracks that allow cyclists to move safely and through shorter distances. However, such initiatives may result in bicycles infrastructure built alongside traditional vehicular roads or on inadequate regions. Therefore, there should be a flexible way to assess the quality of bike paths and tracks, combining variables that indicate adverse conditions for the health and safety of cyclists, such as statistical risk of accidents, air and noise pollution, excessive sunlight exposure, dangerous UV radiation, among others. This article then proposes a new comprehensive quality metric that combines sensed environmental data and historical reported incidents related to bike paths and tracks, which may be employed for traditional physical signaling or to support computer-assisted solutions for cycling monitoring and alerting. Such new metric exploits fuzzy logic to model a group of variables to ultimately provide a unified safety and health quality level, referred as BikeWay. Doing so, we expect to allow dynamic and historical perceptions of how healthy and safe the bike paths and tracks are for cyclists in modern cities. © 2013 IEEE.},

Saliency detection is a fundamental step in surveillance data analysis for providing help to the subsequent tasks, but unsuitable to IoT applications owing to the neglect of image similarity and difference from diverse IoT devices. To solve this problem, we enable the co-saliency detection in IoT, which detects the common and salient foreground regions in the group surveillance images. The main contributions include: 1) enable a multistage context perception scheme to efficiently extract the contextual information corresponding to different-size receptive fields in the single image; 2) construct a two-path information propagation to extract the interimage similarity and difference from the high-level image feature representations of the group images; and 3) propose the stage-wise refinement to allocate the label information to different parts of the network for helping the network to learn the enriched semantically common knowledge. The extensive experiments performed on three public data sets can demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its superiority to four state-of-the-art co-saliency detection methods. © 2014 IEEE.},

We describe the main types of mobility data highlighting their strengths and weaknesses. We classify the primary methods for obtaining knowledge from mobility data. Also, we exemplify how these mobility traces and methods can be applied to vehicular networks by reviewing recent contributions. Furthermore, we illustrate through a case study how to obtain knowledge from a specific type of mobility trace.

These networks are an essential component of intelligent transportation systems and have the potential to ease traffic management, lower accident rates, and offer other solutions to smart cities. One of the most challenging aspects in the design of a vehicular network is the distribution of its infrastructure units, which are called roadside units (RSUs). In this work, we tackle the gamma deployment problem that consists of deploying the minimum number of RSUs in a vehicular network in accordance with a quality of service metric called gamma deployment. This metric defines a vehicle as covered if it connects to some RSUs at least once in a given time interval during its whole trip. Then, the metric parameterizes the minimum percentage of covered vehicles necessary to make a deployment acceptable or feasible. In this paper, we prove that the decision version of the gamma deployment problem in grids is NP-complete. Moreover, we correct the multiflow integer linear programming formulation present in the literature and introduce a new formulation based on set covering that is at least as strong as the multiflow formulation. In experiments with a commercial solver, the set covering formulation widely outperforms the multiflow formulation with respect to running time and linear programming relaxation gap. © 2019 The Authors.

Opportunistic network, a successor of mobile ad hoc networks and a budding technology of network, is a best-suited technology for implementing Smart Spaces due to its wide range of applications in real-life scenarios ranging from building smart cities to interplanetary communication. There are numerous routing protocols which are available in opportunistic network, each having their pros and cons; however, no research till the time of listing has been done which can quantitatively demonstrate the maximum performance of these protocols and standardize the comparison of opportunistic routing protocols which has been a major cause of ambiguous performance evaluation studies. The work here presents a categorical view of the opportunistic routing protocol family and thereby compares and contrasts the various simulators suited for their simulation. Thereafter, the most popular protocols (selecting at least one protocol from each category) are compared based on node density on as many as 8 standard performance metrics using ONE simulator to observe their scalability, realism, and comparability. The work concludes by presenting the merits and demerits of each of the protocols discussed as well as specifying the best routing protocol among all the available protocols for Smart Spaces with maximum output. It is believed that the results achieved by the implemented methodology will help future researchers to choose appropriate routing protocol to delve into their research under different scenarios. © 2020 Puneet Garg et al.},

We thus devise a smart garbage collection management system, coined SmartGC, whose architecture is detailed and explained. Abstracting out garbage collection from a smart mobility perspective, the underlying methodology supporting the proposed architecture relies on the concept of artificial transportation systems. For the sake of demonstration we have implemented a routing strategy to generate improved itineraries accounting for the content of garbage containers, which are continuously monitored through IoT-based smart meters. Also, we discuss on how the architecture is instantiated and integrated into the smart city agenda of Natal, a medium-size capital in Northeastern Brazil.

IoV architecture is seen as a big player in different areas such as the automobile industry, research organizations, smart cities and intelligent transportation for various commercial and scientific applications. However, as VANET is vulnerable to various types of security attacks, the IoV structure should ensure security and efficient performance for vehicular communications. To address these issues, in this article, an authentication-based protocol (A-MAC) for smart vehicular communication is proposed along with a novel framework towards an IoV architecture model. The scheme requires hash operations and uses cryptographic concepts to transfer messages between vehicles to maintain the required security. Performance evaluation helps analyzing its strength in withstanding various types of security attacks. Simulation results demonstrate that A-MAC outshines other protocols in terms of communication cost, execution time, storage cost, and overhead. © 2020 by the authors.},

In the IoT, the system’s functionalities are distributed among devices that (i) collect, (ii) transmit and (iii) apply algorithms to process and analyze data. A widely adopted technique for increasing the lifetime of an IoT system is using data fusion on the devices that process and analyze data. There are already several works proposing data fusion algorithms for the context of wireless sensor networks and IoT. However, most of them consider that application requirements (such as the data sampling rate and the data range of the events of interest) are previously known, and the solutions are tailored for a single target application. In the context of a smart city, we envision that the IoT will provide a sensing and communication infrastructure to be shared by multiple applications, that will make use of this infrastructure in an opportunistic and dynamic way, with no previous knowledge about its requirements. In this work, we present Heracles, a new data fusion algorithm tailored to meet the demands of the IoT for smart cities. Heracles considers the context of the application, adapting to the features of the dataset to perform the data analysis. Heracles aims at minimizing data transmission to save energy while generating value-added information, which will serve as input for decision-making processes. Results of the performed evaluation show that Heracles is feasible, enhances the performance of decision methods and extends the system lifetime. © 2020 by the authors.

These are inherently distributed, spanning from devices installed in the field up to a cloud datacenter and further to a user smartphone, passing by intermediary stages at different levels of fog computing infrastructure. However, IoT architectures provide almost no hints on where components should be deployed. IoT Software Platforms derived from the layered architectures are expected to adapt to scenarios with different characteristics, requirements, and constraints from stakeholders and applications. In such a complex environment, a one-size-fits-all approach does not adapt well to varying demands and may hinder the adoption of IoT Smart Applications. In this paper, we propose a 5-layer IoT Architecture and a 5-stage IoT Computing Continuum, as well as provide insights on the mapping of software components of the former into physical locations of the latter. Also, we conduct a performance analysis study with six configurations where components are deployed into different stages. Our results show that different deployment configurations of layered components into staged locations generate bottlenecks that affect system performance and scalability. Based on that, policies for static deployment and dynamic migration of layered components into staged locations can be identified. © 2019 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

Many company leaders are investing more effort and money in transforming their services to capitalize on the benefits provided by the IoT. Thereby, the decision makers in public waste management do not want to be outdone, and it is challenging to provide an efficient and real-time waste management system. This paper proposes a solution (hardware, software, and communications) that aims to optimize waste management and include a citizen in the process. The system follows an IoT-based approach where the discarded waste from the smart bin is continuously monitored by sensors that inform the filling level of each compartment, in real-time. These data are stored and processed in an IoT middleware providing information for collection with optimized routes and generating important statistical data for monitoring the waste collection accurately in terms of resource management and the provided services for the community. Citizens can easily access information about the public waste bins through the Web or a mobile application. The creation of the real prototype of the smart container, the development of the waste management application and a real-scale experiment use case for evaluation, demonstration, and validation show that the proposed system can efficiently change the way people deal with their garbage and optimize economic and material resources. © 2020 by the authors.

 abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has attracted much attention from the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) community in recent years. One of the main reasons for this is the availability of techniques provided by this paradigm, such as environmental monitoring employing user data and everyday objects. The facilities provided by the IoT infrastructure allow the development of a wide range of new business models and applications (e.g., smart homes, smart cities, or e-health). However, there are still concerns over the security measures which need to be addressed to ensure a suitable deployment. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks are among the most severe virtual threats at present and occur prominently in this scenario, which can be mainly owed to their ease of execution. In light of this, several research studies have been conducted to find new strategies as well as improve existing techniques and solutions. The use of emerging technologies such as those based on the Software-Defined Networking (SDN) paradigm has proved to be a promising alternative as a means of mitigating DDoS attacks. However, the high granularity that characterizes the IoT scenarios and the wide range of techniques explored during the DDoS attacks make the task of finding and implementing new solutions quite challenging. This problem is exacerbated by the lack of benchmarks that can assist developers when designing new solutions for mitigating DDoS attacks for increasingly complex IoT scenarios. To fill this knowledge gap, in this study we carry out an in-depth investigation of the state-of-the-art and create a taxonomy that describes and characterizes existing solutions and highlights their main limitations. Our taxonomy provides a comprehensive view of the reasons for the deployment of the solutions, and the scenario in which they operate. The results of this study demonstrate the main benefits and drawbacks of each solution set when applied to specific scenarios by examining current trends and future perspectives, for example, the adoption of emerging technologies based on Cloud and Edge (or Fog) Computing. © 2020 by the authors.

 abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) is evolving to multi-application scenarios in smart cities, which demand specific traffic patterns and requirements. Multi-applications share resources from a single multi-hop wireless networks, where smart devices collaborate to send collected data over a Low-Power and Lossy Networks (LLNs). Routing Protocol for LLNs (RPL) emerged as a routing protocol to be used in IoT scenarios where the devices have limited resources. Instances are RPL mechanisms that play a key role in order to support the IoT scenarios with multiple applications, but it is not standardized yet. Although there are related works proposing multiple instances in RPL on the same IoT network, those works still have limitations to support multiple applications. For instance, there is a lack of flexibility and dynamism in management of multiple instances and service differentiation for applications. In this context, the goal of this work is to develop a solution called DYNAmic multiple RPL instanceS for multiple ioT applicatIons (DYNASTI), which provides more dynamism and flexibility by managing multiple instances of RPL. As a result of this, the traffic performance of multiple applications is enhanced through the routing, taking into consideration the distinct requirements of the applications. In addition, DYNASTI enables the support of sporadic applications as well as the coexistence between regular and sporadic applications. DYNASTI achieved results that demonstrate a significant improvement in reducing the number of control messages, which resulted in increased packet received, decreased end-to-end delay, reduced energy consumption, and an improvement in service differentiation to multiple applications. © 2020 by the authors.},

 abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a paradigm that aims at making people's life easier, e.g., through highly automated production processes in Smart Factories. In the IoT, heterogeneous interconnected devices communicate through standardized internet protocols to reach common goals. Well known applications of the IoT are Smart Homes, Smart Factories, or Smart Cities. However, setting up new IoT environments can be cumbersome, since this oftentimes requires many complex manual steps, such as setting up devices, configuring sensors, or writing scripts. The heterogeneity and high distribution in the IoT makes this task even more complex and time consuming. To ease the setup of IoT environments, we propose a new approach composed of (i) a toolbox with common building blocks of the IoT, and (ii) a business process based approach to orchestrate the setup of these building blocks. Through our approach, domain experts can select the building blocks they require for their IoT application and generate a step-by-step manual for their setup.

 abstract = {This paper posits a smart ecosystem as a complex system with several interdependent components or subsystems: Smart city (or larger area), smart buildings, smart office, smart manufacturing, smart life. Understanding, design, and operation of such a system should be supported by a comprehensive ontology. The paper gives a short introduction to the structure of ontologies as consisting of a schema-level ontology - an elaborated entity-relationship model - and many entity-value-level ontologies - for each entity type a list or taxonomy of entity values or a specification how entity values should be formatted (such as the XML format for date and time). The paper outlines a process of developing a comprehensive ontology by collecting and integrating specifications from many sources and illustrates this process by building a very preliminary taxonomy of (smart) ecosystem functions from seven sources.

Compound by management software, Drones and specific IoT devices, both referred to as sensors, the sensors collect the data of the interest areas in real time, creating a specified database. Based on the data collected from the interest areas, SIGI software has the ability to show real-time situational analysis of these areas and allows that the administrator can optimize resources (material and human) improving the efficiency of resource allocation in these areas. In addition to the development of the management software, the development of sensors to collect the information in the field and update these information to the database of the management software, are considered. The sensors will be recognized as IoT devices for the collection of meteorological data, images and command / control Drones. Initially the system will be customized, using an Artificial Intelligence tool, to collect data and identify the outbreaks of the dengue mosquito, zika and Chikungunya, nominee by risk areas. After the definition of the potential risk areas, in a complementary way, a totally customized Drone will be used to map these areas of interest, generating aerial photographs, identifying and geotagging the potential “targets”, which will allow the agents to identify potential mosquito breeding sites. After the identification of breeding areas, the next step will be the effective combat of the vectors, using the Drones to fly over the areas of interest, where biological defenses will be “dropped” over the targets to combat mosquitoes. Due some Drone flight restrictions over the cities, the whole process will be monitored by a situation room, that will be able to control the Drone remotely, access the air space controller, reads the sensors installed in the city (field), that will measure, for example, rainfall through weather stations installed in risk areas and subsequently processed by Intelligent System Integrated Management (SIGI), which will result to the information public official reflecting the situational analysis of the areas, which will enable a better management of available resources, helping the public agent, preventively in the decision making.},

 abstract = {Blockchain technology has been applied to various applications (e.g., smart buildings and smart cities) that typically run in an environment of smart devices, known as Internet-of-Things (IoT). To support these applications, different blockchain architectures, data structures and consensus algorithms have been proposed, tailored to IoT. One such proposal, appendable-block blockchain, is a promising blockchain framework for use in IoT environments. It provides a scalable data structure that allows parallel insertions between independent nodes. However, it has some limitations, in particular related to the possible eclipse attack by malicious gateways and the lack of consensus for transactions insertion. To solve these issues, we propose a new consensus mechanism for appendable-block blockchains, called context-based consensus. Using context-based consensus, information can be inserted in parallel across devices (called context) while ensuring that light-weight consensus is performed to guarantee that a transaction is well-formed and it is placed in the correct order. We implemented context-based consensus and show that using multiple contexts reduces latency and increases the throughput of transaction insertions when compared to consensus without contexts or using single transaction consensus.  © 2020 IEEE.},

Therefore, aiming to minimize these impacts, we present ALIVE, a distributed and Vanet-based solution that reduces congestion caused by different sources and, especially, from accident sources, contributing to efficient urban mobility in smart cities. The solution performs the detection of accidents and the dissemination of warning messages in multiple hops. Besides, the system can share the road traffic information with the nearby streets to improve traffic efficiency. We evaluated the proposed solution with PANDORA and NRR Traffic Management solutions.

In this paper, we propose a clustering method to analyze textual data employing the unsupervised machine learning algorithms k-means and hierarchical clustering. We assess different vector representation methods for text, similarity metrics, and the number of clusters that best matches the data. We evaluate the methods using a real database of a public record service of security occurrences.

This paper proposes and investigates the performance of a new ENS framework which allows the sending of events to a subset of subscribers with the best conditions to handle it. The event model implemented by the ENS framework is derived from the publish-subscribe approach. It allows the best subscribers to receive the event based on a specific fitness function. An application of the ENS to the transport service is presented. The results show that when the best subscribers are chosen according to a specific desired metric, the travel time can be reduced or the best drivers can be selected.

With the emergence of smart cities, which is a remarkable example of SoS, there is also an emerging need that almost any type of system should be prepared to join the smart city system and become a constituent of that SoS, even temporarily. However, several attempts to build a real SoS have stumbled on the limitations of single systems, also known as Constituent System (CS), to fully interoperate in the context of a SoS. The majority of the existing systems were not designed to be part of a SoS, interoperate in a instantaneous way, or maintain their operational independence despite their participation in one or more SoS. Based on this context, the main contribution of this paper is to exploit how to design a software architecture for systems that are intended to become part of a SoS in the future. We conducted a software architecture design process to conceive a constituent architecture for Urban Mobility domain as CS. We evaluated the architecture by means of simulation. Preliminary results reveal that our proposal comply with the requirements raised during the architectural design process and can increase the possibility of a system to be a constituent of SoS. © 2020 IEEE.},

In less than four months, TdO reached more than 20,000 users with several user roles, functionalities and a strictly defined privacy policy. Location data allows TdO to notify users when they have possible suspicious contact with an infected person or have gone through virus hot zones. The platform also helps city health officials to select people for infectious testing, according to user information on symptoms, comorbid diseases, contact with infected people, risk status and QR health code. Our integration with private institutions enables employers to know which employees have tested positive to protect work environments. We discuss the partnerships involved with TdO's deployment and compare our context with related apps around the world, suggesting that public scrutiny, government investments and integration with active applications in the city are essential to achieving massive use. Further, we evaluate the feedback of active users (N=175), analyzing the positive points and advising improvements for future work on participatory applications during an epidemic.},

 pages = {1--8}, 
 abstract = {Large cities seek to incorporate intelligent systems into their infrastructure, industrial, educational, and social activities to improve the quality of service provided to citizens and make all processes more efficient. To this end, these cities use technologies that involve the areas of the Internet of Things, Big Data, and Governance to make decisions by governments and authorities. In the field of Urban Computing, it is possible to use open data in the GTFS format to solve the problems of the urban transport system using complex network metrics that make it possible to model complex interactions between objects in high dimensionality. Stops and routes are modeled as a graph, characterized by complex network metrics. According to the literature, if there is an interruption of the urban transport system, we make an evaluation of the degree of vulnerability of the system in the search for solutions. The main goal of this paper is to propose an approach to analyze the vulnerability of the urban transport system using complex network metrics along with GTFS data in scenarios targeted failures. As a contribution, the proposed approach uses the concept of skewness in the methodology established in the literature. The skewness enables a better understanding and differential the failure conditions from the evaluation of the vulnerability the urban transport system, through a quantitative indication of which local metrics most influence the decay of network metrics. The analysis of the results obtained in the proposed approach serves as a subsidy for studies in the search for solutions to the problems of the urban transport system, providing a tool to the set of technological options for the planning of urban transport systems of smart cities available to governments and authorities. The proposed approach can be applied in different cities, regardless of their size and location, as long as you have access to open geographic data in the GTFS format.  © 2020 IEEE.},

In this context, we propose a dynamic algorithm to automatically assign emergency vehicles in smart city scenarios, exploiting for that a sensors-based emergency detection system to provide emergency alerts.

 abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic imposes a whole new way for cities to deal with crises. More than ever, in order to protect the citizens, cities need to rely on data to address such a public health emergency. In this sense, the Urban Control and Command Centers (CCCs) are an important governance organism to help the monitoring and the management of the complex dynamic of contemporary cities. These centralized and integrated management structures in the form of a governmental agency can aid the decision makers into a more coordinated, systemic, strategic, and data-driven intervention. In Rio de Janeiro's case, the city Urban CCC-called Rio de Janeiro Operations Center (COR in the Portuguese abbreviation)-is mostly designed to monitor the daily routine of the different systems and infrastructures that compose the city's dynamic, to plan and integrate operations for big events like Rio 2016 Olympic Games and to manage emergency situations. With the monitoring center, Rio is able to identify abnormalities and make sure that any interference in the city can be resolved in a timely manner, in order to ensure that the city comes back to normal in the face of a disruption and runs as smoothly as possible. Regarding the context of the pandemic of the COVID-19, Urban CCCs can also be an important tool to manage health emergencies. In this paper, the case of the COR is presented, showing how this Brazilian city is using its Urban CCC to monitor and assist the authorities with real time data intelligence to respond to this unprecedented emergency.  © 2020 IEEE.},

Our methodology aimed on finding whether people would be willing to share their location, as well as their health issues related to COVID-19. It is composed by a survey for verifying the interest of the proposed application; the prototype of the application; and the use of Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). We can see that the vast majority of respondents to the first survey were interested in using a contact tracking application, even though they need to share their location and report when they become infected.

 abstract = {The widespread adoption of 5G cellular technology is becoming the major driver for the growth of IoT-based applications. In this paper we consider a Mobile Service Provider (MSP) that launches a smart city service based on IoT data readings. In order to serve IoT data collected across different locations, the MSP dynamically negotiates and rescales bandwidth and service functions. 5G network slicing functions are key to lease appropriate amount of resources over heterogeneous access technologies and different site types. Also, different infrastructure providers will charge slicing service depending on specific access technology supported across regional sites and IoT data collection patterns.We introduce a pricing mechanism based on Age of Information (AoI) to reduce the cost of MSPs. It provides incentives for devices to smooth traffic by shifting part of the traffic load from highly congested and more expensive locations to lesser charged ones, while meeting QoS requirements of the IoT service. The proposed optimal pricing scheme comprises a two-stage decision process, where the MSP determines the pricing of each location and devices schedule uploads of collected data based on the optimal uploading policy. Simulations show that the MSP attains consistent cost reductions tuning the trade-off between slicing costs and the AoI of uploaded IoT data. © 2020 ITC Press.},

IoT is the basis for smart cities, e-health, precision agriculture, among others. With this growth, the number of cyber-attacks against these types of devices and services has also increased. Each type of attack has its specific characteristics that allow its identification and prevention through machine learning techniques. However, classic machine learning techniques may have their performance compromised due to the non-stationary characteristics of these environments, together with the search for different types of vulnerabilities by attackers, attacks can suffer different types of mutations, in addition to the great possibility of new types of attacks arising over time. In this article, we propose an algorithm called Fuzzy Intrusion Detection System for IoT Networks (FROST) to identify cyber-attacks on IoT networks. FROST uses the concepts of fuzzy set theory to make the learning task more flexible, seeking to improve the performance in the classification of inaccurate data. In addition, FROST has a mechanism for identifying new types of intrusion online, during the classification of new instances. To evaluate our approach, we used the UNSW-NB15 data set and compared our method with another approach, very consolidated in the literature, which performs the same type of task. The results showed that FROST has a good performance in the classification of different types of attacks and that the fuzzy technique used helped to reduce errors and identify anomalies.  © 2020 IEEE.},

Many researchers have been developing algorithms to predict crime occurrences to tackle this problem. The smart cities' environment can provide us enough ubiquitous data, e.g., traffic flow, human mobility, and Points of Interest (POI) information, to feed those predictive policing algorithms and reflect city dynamics. POIs data provide essential information such as geographical location, category, customer reviews, and busy hours. Recent studies have shown that POI geographical locations are useful for predictive policing. In this paper, we aim at predicting crimes in a delimited region around the POIs of a city with new environmental features. We investigate the relevance of POIs location and the semantic and the temporal features from POIs data in our problem. We also propose and analyze different machine learning approaches to train prediction functions based on these features and conduct experiments on real crime data over multiple years. The experiments demonstrate that the popular time feature is more relevant than the historical information about the number of crimes around a POI, but both information is much less critical than the spatio-temporal information. This work is the first that studies the popular time feature extracted from POIs data and historical criminal information for predictive policing from the authors' knowledge. © 2020 ACM.},

Consequently, the analysis of smart city data is often domain-specific, thus limiting the capabilities of the offered services and hampering decision-making that relies on isolated domain information. To support a suitable analysis across multiple domains, it is necessary having a unified data model able to handle the inherent heterogeneity of smart city data and take into account both geographic and citizen information. This paper presents an ontology-based information model to support multi-domain analysis in smart cities to foster interoperability and powerful automated reasoning upon unambiguous information. The proposed information model follows Linked Data principles and takes advantage of ontologies to define information semantically. The semantic relationships and properties defined in the model also allow inferring new pieces of information that improve accuracy when analyzing multiple city domains.

The increase in the volume of produced data makes the processing and the aggregation of information at a single remote data center unfeasible or too expensive, while latency-critical applications cannot cope with the high network delays of a remote data center. Fog computing is a preferred solution as latency-sensitive tasks can be moved closer to the sensors. Furthermore, the same fog nodes can perform data aggregation and filtering to reduce the volume of data that is forwarded to the cloud data centers, reducing the risk of network overload. In this paper, we focus on the problem of designing a fog infrastructure considering both the location of how many fog nodes are required, which nodes should be considered (from a list of potential candidates), and how to allocate data flows from sensors to fog nodes and from there to cloud data centers. To this aim, we propose and evaluate a formal model based on a multi-objective optimization problem. We thoroughly test our proposal for a wide range of parameters and exploiting a reference scenario setup taken from a realistic smart city application. We compare the performance of our proposal with other approaches to the problem available in literature, taking into account two objective functions. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed model is viable for the design of fog infrastructure and can outperform the alternative models, with results that in several cases are close to an ideal solution. © Copyright 2020 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

 abstract = {The evolution and development of new technological solutions for smart cities has significantly grown in recent years. The smart city scenario encompasses larges amount of data from several devices and applications. This raises challenges related to data interoperability, including information sharing, receiving data from multiple sources (Web services, files, systems, etc.), and making them available at underlying smart city application development platforms. This paper presents Aquedücte, a service that converts data from external sources and files to the NGSI-LD protocol, enabling their use by applications relying on an NGSI-LD-based middleware. This paper describes the Aquedücte methodology used to: (i) extract data from heterogeneous data sources, (ii) enrich them according to the NGSI-LD data format using Linked Data along with ontologies, and (iii) publish them into an NSGI-LD-based middleware. The use of Aquedücte is also described in a real-world smart city scenario. Copyright © 2020 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {The technological development and dissemination of IoT equipment have led to large volumes of environmental data which, in some cases, are incomplete, follow different formats of representation, and even have different semantic approaches. All such aspects and the heterogeneity of different IoT components (e.g., network interfaces, communication protocols, data structure, and data semantics) have caused interoperability issues which might hamper the effectiveness of support decision systems for smart cities, where the use of big data and machine learning techniques has been considered, in addition to the exploration of smart city data. This article proposes an environment IoT-based platform for smart cities that grants interoperability from data capture to knowledge extraction and visualization through the use of Semantic Web Technologies and the definition of an ontology for environment indicators. The components of the platform include IoT devices, gateways, cloud, and fog computing, which are used for a better application of big data techniques. A real environment quality monitoring use case was considered for the validation of the platform. Metrics, such as latency and resources consumption, were analyzed for three communication protocols, namely, MQTT, CoAP, and REST. CoAP adapter provided the best results regarding latency, RAM, and CPU consumption. © 2020 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

According to the Corruption Perceptions Index 2017, for 180 countries/territories studied, most of them are making little or no progress in ending corruption in the public sector. The public money laundered affects direct investments in infrastructure to improve the city’s performance. The corruption encourages directly the illicit activities formation and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) estimates that hundreds of billions of dollars of revenue from illicit activities are handled globally every year and was identified in the context of National Risk Assessments as part of the major risks that could affect countries in development. These practices have generated negative effects in society and the cities are the context in which all these issues occur. Then, this paper has aimed to conduct a qualitative reflection of how smart cities, which represent efficiency and effectiveness places, can contribute through your intelligent environment to mitigate the corruption process and illicit market operations. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Zoos visual information is an example of well-designed signals for providing data associated with the species in the exhibition, but all this information is colorful and with different signals, such as the colors of the species, their habitat including their food and geographical distribution, which it means that is not the must inclusive information for people that cannot perceive colors or that has some kind of condition that difficulties metal associations. Thus, any child who has a condition associated with the identification of colors, or certain mental condition will have difficulties to understand the zoo signals. Down syndrome is the most frequent cause of mental disability, presenting similar difficulties among people who suffer from it; a short-term memory capacity, exhausting attention and language delay are some of its most frequent characteristics. In Mexico, only 3% of children with Down Syndrome receive education. However, there are several technological alternatives that has been implemented around the world, and the use of robots is gradually becoming a good alternative for assisting and performing therapy to people that suffers this disability. NAO is an Aldebaran humanoid robot with several sensors, actuators and tools, that can be programmed with python, which has helped to popularize this friendly robot in the assisting of people. In this paper, we propose the use of a humanoid robot for future applications in therapy for children with Down Syndrome.

 abstract = {The current trend of the modern smart cities applications towards a continuous increase in the volume of produced data and the concurrent need for low and predictable latency in the response time has motivated the shift from a cloud to a fog computing approach. A fog computing architecture is likely to represent a preferable solution to reduce the application latency and the risk of network congestion by decreasing the volume of data transferred to cloud data centers. However, the design of a fog infrastructure opens new issues concerning not only how to allocate the data flow coming from sensors to fog nodes and from there to cloud data centers, but also the choice of the number and the location of the fog nodes to be activated among a list of potential candidates. We model this facility location issue through a multi-objective optimization problem. We propose a heuristic based on the variable neighborhood search, where neighborhood structures are based on swap and move operations. The proposed method is tested in a wide range of scenarios, considering a smart city application’s realistic setup with geographically distributed sensors. The experimental evaluation shows that our method can achieve stable and better performance concerning other literature approaches, supporting the given application. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

 abstract = {In day-to-day life, all could witness the odor of scattered garbage and unkempt garbage bins because there is no proper time interval schedules and routines, which results in garbage overflow. It also creates hygienic problems, land pollution, and landscape unpleasantness. This scenario demands a system that observes the garbage bin status and provides evidence to the authorities administrating the collection intervals for emptying the bins. The so-called Digital Garbage Bin Monitoring System (DGBMS) is a smart garbage management system relying on the Internet of Things (IoT) technology that can solve this problem. This system monitors the garbage excess and the moisture in the garbage bin. In this project, a sensor network detects the garbage level and the garbage moisture in the dustbin via an Infrared (IR) sensor and then sends evidence to the decision-making party through an IP address. The UNO ARDUINO board interfaces the sensors with the IP address and handles the actuators. An RFID channel constantly monitors the necessary garbage information regarding the different locations of the wastebaskets. Developing countries, especially the rural areas, are severely concerned with these issues that can cause severe health problems among the population. Implementing this solution could contribute to addressing many health-related issues in these countries. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

 abstract = {The growing aging of the world’s population along with several environmental, social and economic factors, end up posing major challenges for public health. One challenge is the detection and treatment of high cost patients, i.e., a small percentage of patients associated with majority of expenditures in healthcare. The early detection of patients who may become high cost in the future can be used to better target interventions focusing on preventing their transition or, in the case of those who are already in such condition, to allow appropriate approaches, rather than generic ones. In both cases, the detection of such patients can be beneficial, reducing avoidable costs and improving patients’ condition. In order to make such detection, this work has focused on using deep learning techniques, specifically, Neural Networks, along with a dataset composed of survey answers applied by the United States government, called Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) and attributes gathered from the literature. For the purposes of this work, 11 years of the MEPS dataset were considered, including the years from 2006 to 2016.

License plate detection (LPD) is a critical process in automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) that reduces complexity by delimiting the search space for subsequent ALPR stages. It is complicated by unfavourable factors including environmental conditions, occlusion, and license plate variation. As such, it requires training models on substantial volumes of relevant images per use case. In 2018, the new Mercosur standard came in to effect in four South American countries. Access to large volumes of actual Mercosur license plates with sufficient presentation variety is a significant challenge for training supervised models for LPD, thereby adversely impacting the efficacy of ALPR in Mercosur countries. This paper presents a novel license plate embedding methodology for generating large volumes of accurate Mercosur license plate images sufficient for training supervised LPD. We validate this methodology with a deep learning-based ALPR using a convolutional neural network trained exclusively with synthetic data and tested with real parking lot and traffic camera images.

 abstract = {Nowadays, the Internet of Things (IoT) allows monitoring and automation in diverse contexts, such as hospitals, homes, or even smart cities, just to name a few examples. IoT data processing may occur, at the edge of the network or in the cloud, but frequently the processing must be divided between the two layers. Aiming to guarantee that the IoT systems works efficiently, it is essential to evaluate the system even in initial design stages. However, evaluating hybrid systems composed by multiple layers is not an easy task as a myriad of parameters are involved in the process. Thus, this paper presents two SPN models (one base and extended one) that can represent an abstract distributed system composed of IoT, edge and cloud layers. The models are highly configurable to be used in diverse simulation scenarios. Besides a sensitivity analysis evidenced the most impacting components in the studied architecture and made it possible to optimize the base SPN model. Finally a case study explores multiple metrics of interest concurrently and works as a guide of the model utilization. Ultimately, the proposed approach can assist system designers to avoid unnecessary investment in original equipment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Performance analysis through a proof-of-concept implementation presents average energy savings of up to 61.51% when augmenting with a scheduling system and variable long sleep cycles (LS), and potential for 75.9% savings in specific conditions. We also concluded that there is no linear relation between increasing LS time and additional savings.

 abstract = {Smart cities are nowadays equipped with pervasive networks of sensors that monitor traffic in real-time and record huge volumes of traffic data. These datasets constitute a rich source of information that can be used to extract knowledge useful for municipalities and citizens. In this paper we are interested in exploiting such data to estimate future speed in traffic sensor networks, as accurate predictions have the potential to enhance decision making capabilities of traffic management systems. Building effective speed prediction models in large cities poses important challenges that stem from the complexity of traffic patterns, the number of traffic sensors typically deployed, and the evolving nature of sensor networks. Indeed, sensors are frequently added to monitor new road segments or replaced/removed due to different reasons (e.g., maintenance). Exploiting a large number of sensors for effective speed prediction thus requires smart solutions to collect vast volumes of data and train effective prediction models. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of real-world sensor networks calls for solutions that are resilient not only to changes in traffic behavior, but also to changes in the network structure, where the cold start problem represents an important challenge. We study three different approaches in the context of large and dynamic sensor networks: local, global, and cluster-based. The local approach builds a specific prediction model for each sensor of the network. Conversely, the global approach builds a single prediction model for the whole sensor network. Finally, the cluster-based approach groups sensors into homogeneous clusters and generates a model for each cluster. We provide a large dataset, generated from ∼1.3 billion records collected by up to 272 sensors deployed in Fortaleza, Brazil, and use it to experimentally assess the effectiveness and resilience of prediction models built according to the three aforementioned approaches. The results show that the global and cluster-based approaches provide very accurate prediction models that prove to be robust to changes in traffic behavior and in the structure of sensor networks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

 abstract = {The popularization of the Internet of Things has opened opportunities for applications in various economic sectors, allowing them to monitor and control various types of environments. However, with the increasing number of data sent by devices, applications have come to demand increased availability and Internet bandwidth, but these demands are still a bottleneck in regions farther from large urban centers and with less economic development. In this work, we examine how bandwidth limitations can affect cloud-based applications and propose a Fog Computing-based Control-as-a-Service architecture to dynamically process events in the context of Internet of Things and Smart Environments. The architecture is composed of a Rules Engine and a Complex Event Processor based on Supervisory Control techniques for Discrete Event Systems. The Rules Engine allows defining dynamic rules conditioning control from different types of input data. The Complex Event Processor with automatic synthesis and reconfiguration capability allows performing control actions to established rules. Finally, we present scenarios where this solution can be applied, such as Smart Farm, Smart Home, Smart City, and Smart Healthcare. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.},

The system consists of a network of arterial roads with exclusive lanes for autonomous vehicles where they can travel in platoons.

However, vehicles using this technology need to share space with vehicles not connected or with other automation levels. Among the bottlenecks in scenarios like this, Platoons formation and splits stand out, as these maneuvers involve costs and risk. Therefore, our contribution is developing a new strategy for Platoons formationin a mixed universe of vehicles to bring some of these desired benefits. The results show that the proposed solution achieved an accuracy of 89% of the entire amount of platoons in the datasets.

However, with the increasing number of public (bus) and private vehicles (car, motorcycle, and truck), urban centers are becoming more and more populous. Such phenomenon leads to traffic congestion and increases environmental and noise pollution. In order to stem the rise of such problems, large cities are adopting technological solutions, materializing the concept of smart cities. While observing traffic management systems themselves, several hardware and software solutions have been studied and implemented around the world. This article aims to contribute to traffic signals improvement by developing a centralized traffic light control system, using a unique wireless communication network. In order to prove the system's effectiveness, the most common types of urban intersections were analyzed. Direct control routines were implemented for network traffic lights, providing a complete control system for extraordinary events, such as closing roads due to accidents or public events. Finally, safety routines were formulated to report the operating status of the traffic light system lamps to a central management. With the aid of a logic analyzer connected to the outputs for each focal group, it was possible to set up an operating stages timing diagram of each traffic light. Thus, the system validation was achieved based on theoretical and practical timing diagrams similarities. © 2014 IEEE.},

Our algorithm identifies the sensor data behavior through the Causality Complexity-Entropy Plane and performs data reduction by removing redundant data without losing the system’s properties. For this, we recognize the systems’ dynamic changes in real-time through a delimiter, named Maximum Complexity Point (MCP). Thus, we determine when to update the sampling period to maximize the system’s information content, i.e., the statistical complexity quantifier. To confirm the sampling adaptability, we apply our method in three different chaotic attractors: Rossler, Lorenz, and  ${B}_{7}$ . We compared our solution with two other sampling algorithms: (i) random histogram-based sampling and the  ${L}$  algorithm. We use the K-S test, the average Data Error, and the Causality Complexity-Entropy Plane to compare the results. Using our sampling approach, we observed K-S test distances less than 3% for chaotic maps and 1% for natural environments data. The best results were in the Data Error, showing an average error rate up to 13.4% lower when evaluating chaotic data and 15.7% lower when evaluating natural environments. Regarding the dispersion of points in the Causality Complexity-Entropy Plane, the sampled time-series reached regions of higher statistical complexity, indicating that they preserved information content, hence the original data’s dynamics.},

 abstract = {Vision sensors in Internet of Things (IoT)-connected smart cities play a vital role in the exponential growth of video data, thereby making its analysis and storage comparatively tough and challenging. Those sensors continuously generate data for 24 hours, which requires huge storage resources, dedicated networks for sharing with data centers, and most importantly, it makes browsing, retrieval, and event searching a difficult and time-consuming job. Video summarization (VS) is a promising direction toward a solution to these problems by analyzing the visual contents acquired from a vision sensor and prioritizing them based on events, saliency, person's appearance, and so on. However, the current VS literature still lacks focus on resource-constrained devices that can summarize data over the edge and upload it to data repositories efficiently for instant analysis. Therefore, in this article, we carry out a survey of functional VS methods to understand their pros and cons for resource-constrained devices, with the ambition to provide a compact tutorial to the community of researchers in the field. Further, we present a novel saliency-aware VS framework, incorporating 5G-enabled IoT devices, which keeps only important data, thereby saving storage resources and providing representative data for immediate exploration. Keeping privacy of data as a second priority, we intelligently encrypt the salient frames over resource-constrained devices before transmission over the 5G network. The reported experimental results show that our proposed framework has additional benefits of faster transmission (1.813.77 percent frames of a lengthy video are considered for transmission), reduced bandwidth, and real-time processing compared to state-of-the-art methods in the field.  © 1986-2012 IEEE.},

Thus, effieicnt optimization of the link with proper monitoring of the high speed of vehicles in ITS is very vital to promote the error-free and trustable platform. Key issues related to reliability, connectivity and stability optimization for vehicular networks are addressed. Thus, this study proposes a novel reliable connectivity framework by developing a stable, and scalable link optimization (SSLO) algorithm, state-of-the-art system model. In addition, a Use-case of smart city with stable and reliable connectivity is proposed by examining the importance of vehicular networks. The numerical experimental results are extracted from software defined-Internet of Vehicle (SD-IoV) platform which shows high stability and reliability of the proposed SSLO under different test scenarios, such as vehicle to vehicle (V2V), vehicle to infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle to anything (V2X). The proposed SSLO and Baseline algorithms are compared in terms of performance metrics e.g. packet loss ratio, transmission power (i.e., stability), average throughput, and average delay transfer. Finally, the validated results reveal that SSLO algorithm optimizes connectivity (95%), energy efficiency (67%), throughput (4Kbps) and delay (3 sec). © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

To attend to these needs, the electromagnetic spectrum must be made available, but the static spectrum allocation policy has caused a spectrum shortage and impaired the employment/expansion of the wireless systems. To overcome this issue, the dynamic spectrum access (DSA) has been promoted in 5G/6G networks, which is enabled by the cognitive radio (CR) technology. Although diverse mechanisms have been developed to tackle the challenges that emerge in different CR layers/functionalities, a standardized testing methodology and system for CR is still immature. Existing standards or methodologies and systems for CR only focus on the definition of network technologies (e.g., IEEE 802.22 and IEEE 802.11af), performance evaluation of CR algorithms/mechanisms, or definition of the device cognition level via performance results or psychometric approaches, not covering systems/methodologies to verify if the device meets the CR capabilities and regulatory policies, neglecting the conformance testing. In this respect, this paper proposes a flexible methodology and system for CR conformance testing under two perspectives, functionalities and limits. We instantiate it by using the Universal Software Radio Peripheral (USRP) software-defined radio platform and present a proof-of-concept with a conformance metric.

As Internet of Things devices are increasingly connected to smart cities, security and privacy have gradually become important issues. Recently, research works on mitigating security challenges of Internet of Things devices in smart cities mainly focused on authentication. However, in most of the existing authentication protocols, the trustworthiness evaluation of Internet of Things devices in smart cities is ignored. Considering the trustworthiness evaluation of Internet of Things devices is an important constituent of data source authentication, in this article, a cloud-aided trustworthiness evaluation mechanism is first designed to improve the credibility of the Internet of Things devices in smart cities. Furthermore, aiming at the problem that the user’s privacy is easy to leak in the process of authentication, an anonymous authentication and key agreement scheme based on non-interactive zero knowledge argument is proposed. The proposed scheme can ensure the privacy preservation and data security of Internet of Things devices in smart cities. The security analysis demonstrates that the proposed scheme is secure under q-SDH problem. The experimental simulation indicates that the performance of the proposal is greatly improved compared with other similar schemes. © The Author(s) 2021.},

However, it is challenging to visualize huge amounts of data from mobility datasets. Plotting raw trajectories on a map often causes data occlusion, impairing the visual analysis. Displaying the multiple attributes that these trajectories come with is an even larger challenge. One approach to solve this problem is trail bundling, which groups motion trails that are spatially close in a simplified representation. In this paper, we augment a recent bundling technique to support multi-attribute trail datasets for the visual analysis of urban mobility. Our case study is based on the travel survey from the São Paulo Metropolitan Area, which is one of the most intense traffic areas in the world.

In this context, one of the applications under development intends to track the recyclable garbage collector trucks in real time over the Internet. Actually, fleet vehicle tracking is one of the main applications for smart cities. LoRaWAN stands out among network technologies for smart cities due to operating in an open frequency range, covering long distances with low power consumption and low equipment cost. However, the coverage and performance of LoRaWAN is directly affected by both the environment and configuration parameters. In addition, tracking devices must be able to send its coordinates to the Internet even when the vehicle goes through zones where there are obstacles for electromagnetic waves such as elevated buildings or valleys. In this paper we perform experimental investigations to evaluate four LoRaWAN tracking devices, two available out of the box and two assembled and programmed. The behavior of each tracking device is analyzed when moving at a constant speed through three representative urban areas totaling 10.71 km2. The two most efficient tracking devices are analyzed in a stretch of 3.5 km with speeds ranging from 0 to 30 km/h, 0 to 50 km/h and 0 to 100 km/h. Results include a quantitative and qualitative aspects, including the received signal strength indication (RSSI), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), packet delivery ratio (PDR), and spreading factor (SF) for the received geographic coordinates.

These services can improve life quality, minimize environmental impacts, improve health service, improve security, and bear the increasing number of people in the cities. Life quality encompasses many subjects, and accessibility for People with Disabilities (PwD) is one. In this article, smart cities focused on helping PwD are called Assistive Smart Cities (ASCs). In this sense, the article proposes a Model for Assistive Smart Cities called MASC. Related works do not cover geographically broad areas, such as cities and metropolitan regions. Moreover, they are not generic in terms of disabilities and are usually intended only for one type of disability. Given this scenario, the MASC covers large regions and supports various disabilities, such as hearing, visual impairment, and limitation of lower limb movements. Unlike the related works, MASC uses the interactions of PwD to compose histories of contexts offered as services. MASC proposes an ontology-based on ubiquitous accessibility concepts. The model evaluation focused on performance, functionality, and usability. Performance and functionality evaluations were performed using data generated by a context simulator called Siafu and data from the Open Street Maps (OSM) platform. Usability was evaluated using a smart wheelchair prototype. The results of usability show 96% acceptance regarding ease of use and 98% regarding system utility. The results indicate that the model supports massive applications, managing information to generate trails. Besides, MASC provides services for different types of users, namely PwD, healthcare professionals, and public administration.  © 2021-IOS Press. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Since the early 2000s, life in cities has changed significantly due to the Internet of Things (IoT). This concept enables developers to integrate different devices collecting, storing, and processing a large amount of data, enabling new services to improve various professional and personal activities. However, privacy issues arise with a large amount of data generated, and solutions based on blockchain technology and smart contract have been developed to address these issues. Nevertheless, several issues must still be taken into account when developing blockchain architectures aimed at the IoT scenario because security flaws still exist in smart contracts, mainly due to the lack of ease when building the code. This article presents a blockchain storage architecture focused on license plate recognition (LPR) systems for smart cities focusing on privacy, performance, and security. The proposed architecture relies on the Ethereum platform. Each smart contract matches the privacy preferences of a license plate to be anonymized through public encryption. The storage of data captured by the LPR system can only be done if the smart contract enables it. However, in the case of motivation foreseen by the legislation, a competent user can change the smart contract and enable the storage of the data captured by the LPR system. Experimental results show that the performance of the proposed architecture is satisfactory, regarding the scalability of the built private network. Furthermore, tests on our smart contract using security and structure analysis tools on the developed script demonstrate that our solution is fraud-proof. The results obtained in all experiments bring evidence that our architecture is feasible to be used in real scenarios. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

 abstract = {Surveillance monitoring systems are highly necessary, aiming to prevent many social problems in smart cities. The internet of things (IoT) nowadays offers a variety of technologies to capture and process massive and heterogeneous data. Due to the fact that (i) advanced analyses of video streams are performed on powerful recording devices; while (ii) surveillance monitoring services require high availability levels in the way that the service must remain connected, for example, to a connection network that offers higher speed than conventional connections; and that (iii) the trustworthy dependability of a surveillance system depends on various factors, it is not easy to identify which components/devices in a system architecture have the most impact on the dependability for a specific surveillance system in smart cities. In this paper, we developed stochastic Petri net models for a surveillance monitoring system with regard to varying several parameters to obtain the highest dependability. Two main metrics of interest in the dependability of a surveillance system including reliability and availability were analyzed in a comprehensive manner. The analysis results show that the variation in the number of long-term evolution (LTE)-based stations contributes to a number of nines (#9s) increase in availability. The obtained results show that the variation of the mean time to failure (MTTF) of surveillance cameras exposes a high impact on the reliability of the system. The findings of this work have the potential of assisting system architects in planning more optimized systems in this field based on the proposed models. © 2021 by the authors.

 abstract = {In smart city scenarios, the huge proliferation of monitoring cameras scattered in public spaces has posed many challenges to network and processing infrastructure. A few dozen cameras are enough to saturate the city’s backbone. In addition, most smart city applications require a real-time response from the system in charge of processing such large-scale video streams. Finding a missing person using facial recognition technology is one of these applications that require immediate action on the place where that person is. In this paper, we tackle these challenges presenting a distributed system for video analytics designed to leverage edge computing capabilities. Our approach encompasses architecture, methods, and algorithms for: (i) dividing the burdensome processing of large-scale video streams into various machine learning tasks; and (ii) deploying these tasks as a workflow of data processing in edge devices equipped with hardware accelerators for neural networks. We also propose the reuse of nodes running tasks shared by multiple applications, e.g., facial recognition, thus improving the system’s processing throughput. Simulations showed that, with our algorithm to distribute the workload, the time to process a workflow is about 33% faster than a naive approach.},

 abstract = {Urban traffic congestion has a significant detrimental impact on the environment, public health and the economy, with at a high cost to society worldwide. Moreover, it is not possible to continually modify urban road infrastructure in order to mitigate increasing traffic demand. Therefore, it is important to develop traffic control models that can handle high-volume traffic data and synchronize traffic lights in an urban network in real time, without interfering with other initiatives. Within this context, this study proposes a model, based on deep reinforcement learning, for synchronizing the traffic signals of an urban traffic network composed of two intersections. The calibration of this model, including training of its neural network, was performed using real traffic data collected at the approach to each intersection. The results achieved through simulations were very promising, yielding significant improvements in indicators measured in relation to the pre-existing conditions in the network. The model was able to deal with a broad spectrum of traffic flows and, in peak demand periods, reduced delays and queue lengths by more than 28% and 42%, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

Still, UAVs usually operate within unlicensed spectrum bands, competing against the increasing number of mobile devices and other wireless networks. Combining UAVs with Cognitive Radio (CR) may increase their general communication performance, thus allowing them to execute missions where the conventional UAVs face limitations. CR provides a smart wireless communication which, instead of using a transmission frequency defined in the hardware, uses software transmission. CR smartly uses free transmission channels and/or chooses them according to application's requirements. Moreover, CR is considered a key enabler for deploying technologies that require high connectivity, such as Smart Cities, 5G, Internet of Things (IoT), and the Internet of Flying Things (IoFT). This paper presents an overview on the field of CR for UAV communications and its state-of-the-art, testbed alternatives for real data experiments, as well as specifications to build a simple and low-cost testbed, and indicates key opportunities and future challenges in the field.},

 abstract = {The advent of 5G will bring a massive adoption of IoT devices across our society. IoT Applications (IoT Apps) will be the primary data collection base. This scenario leads to unprecedented scalability and security challenges, with one of the first areas for these applications being Smart Cities (SC). IoT devices in new network paradigms, such as Edge Computing and Fog Computing, will collect data from urban environments, providing real-time management information. One of these challenges is ensuring that the data sent from Edge Computing are reliable. Blockchain has been a technology that has gained the spotlight in recent years, due to its robust security in fintech and cryptocurrencies. Its strong encryption and distributed and decentralized network make it potential for this challenge. Using Blockchain with IoT makes it possible for SC applications to have security information distributed, which makes it possible to shield against Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS). IoT devices in an SC can have a long life, which increases the chance of having security holes caused by outdated firmware. Adding a layer of identification and verification of attributes and signature of messages coming from IoT devices by Smart Contracts can bring confidence in the content. SC Apps that extract data from legacy and outdated appliances, installed in inaccessible, unknown, and often untrusted urban environments can benefit from this work. Our work’s main contribution is the development of API Gateways to be used in IoT devices and network gateway to sign, identify, and authorize messages. For this, keys and essential characteristics of the devices previously registered in Blockchain are used. We will discuss the importance of this implementation while considering the SC and present a testbed that is composed of Blockchain Ethereum and real IoT devices. We analyze the transfer time, memory, and CPU impacts during the sending and processing of these messages. The messages are signed, identified, and validated by our API Gateways and only then collected for an IoT data management application. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

 abstract = {The effective deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) applications such as smart cities, smart farming and smart transport systems must ensure the network robustness, scalability and longevity. Therefore, guaranteeing the successful delivery of information and extending the lifetime of the nodes that make up a wireless sensor network (WSN) are two essential aspects for IoT applications. This work evaluates the performance of a cooperative WSN by adopting two multiantenna schemes: antenna selection (AS) and beamforming transmission using the singular value decomposition (SVD) technique. In addition, cooperation is established according to an ON–OFF probability, so that the RF receiving circuits of the relays are activated in a probabilistic way, aiming at reducing the energy consumption of the sensors, extending their useful lifetime. Our main goal is to increase the amount of information effectively transmitted by the network, keeping an outage probability constraint. The results show that, when both techniques are used, there is a significant gain in the amount of information effectively transmitted by the network, with emphasis on the AS scheme at short transmission distances. By increasing the number of antennas, it was found that a lower ON–OFF probability is required, i.e., a trade-off is established between the nodes’ hardware complexity and their need for cooperation. © 2021 by the authors.

 abstract = {Digital societies could be characterized by their increasing desire to express themselves and interact with others. This is being realized through digital platforms such as social media that have increasingly become convenient and inexpensive sensors compared to physical sensors in many sectors of smart societies. One such major sector is road transportation, which is the backbone of modern economies and costs globally 1.25 million deaths and 50 million human injuries annually. The cutting-edge on big data-enabled social media analytics for transportation-related studies is limited. This paper brings a range of technologies together to detect road traffic-related events using big data and distributed machine learning. The most specific contribution of this research is an automatic labelling method for machine learning-based traffic-related event detection from Twitter data in the Arabic language. The proposed method has been implemented in a software tool called Iktishaf+ (an Arabic word meaning discovery) that is able to detect traffic events automatically from tweets in the Arabic language using distributed machine learning over Apache Spark. The tool is built using nine components and a range of technologies including Apache Spark, Parquet, and MongoDB. Iktishaf+ uses a light stemmer for the Arabic language developed by us. We also use in this work a location extractor developed by us that allows us to extract and visualize spatio-tem-poral information about the detected events. The specific data used in this work comprises 33.5 million tweets collected from Saudi Arabia using the Twitter API. Using support vector machines, naïve Bayes, and logistic regression-based classifiers, we are able to detect and validate several real events in Saudi Arabia without prior knowledge, including a fire in Jeddah, rains in Makkah, and an accident in Riyadh. The findings show the effectiveness of Twitter media in detecting important events with no prior knowledge about them. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

To make this feasible, it is necessary to establish an IIoT-to-cloud continuum distributing federated brokers across the infrastructure and providing scalability and interoperability.

We tested device-to-device communication across edge and core layers and also interconnected the infrastructure with one in São Paulo, Brazil, replicating the use of a global industry. The successful deployment validates the use of a Helix Multi-layered IoT platform as a suitable backend platform for IIoT applications capable of establishing the IIoT-to-cloud continuum.

This resulted scenario is expected to favor adopting cleaner and flexible modal solutions centered on bicycles and scooters, especially as last-mile options. However, as the use of bicycles has rapidly increased, cyclists have been subject to adverse conditions that may affect their health and safety when cycling in urban areas. Therefore, whereas cities should implement mechanisms to monitor and evaluate adverse conditions in cycling paths, cyclists should have some effective mechanism to visualize the indirect quality of cycling paths, eventually supporting choosing more appropriate routes. Therefore, this article proposes a comprehensive multi-parameter system based on multiple independent subsystems, covering all phases of data collecting, formatting, transmission, and processing related to the monitoring, evaluating, and visualizing the quality of cycling paths in the perspective of adverse conditions that affect cyclist. The formal interactions of all modules are carefully described, as well as implementation and deployment details.

Besides this, as smart cities are underpinned by our ability to engage with our environments, analyze them, and make efficient, sustainable and equitable decisions, the need for a green AI approach is intensified. This perspective paper, reflecting authors’ opinions and interpretations, concentrates on the “green AI” concept as an enabler of the smart city trans-formation, as it offers the opportunity to move away from purely technocentric efficiency solutions towards efficient, sustainable and equitable solutions capable of realizing the desired urban fu-tures.

In those scenarios, alternative transportation has been leveraged as viable solutions for the complex challenges of urban mobility, bringing cycling to a new setting. Actually, when assessing the quality of cycling paths, safety and quality parameters can be retrieved from distributed sensor nodes attached to bikes, allowing better perceptions of the adverse conditions faced by cyclists in modern cities. However, such IoT-based procedures require proper modelling of cycling paths, since quality parameters are expected to have spatiotemporal significance. Therefore, this paper discusses and proposes solutions for some important modelling and visualization issues related to the quality monitoring of cycle paths. Such solutions are concerned with the mathematical modelling of this problem, as well as the proposal of a generic computer-assisted solution to handle environmental parameters retrieved by sensors attached to bikes. Doing so, it is defined a uniform representation model and an expected data flow that can be exploited by any monitoring application in urban areas. As an important step in that direction, a reference implementation is described, allowing formal representation, structured processing and graphical visualization of bike-centric monitoring parameters, potentially supporting new developments in the area of smart cycling. © 2021 IEEE.},

 abstract = {The Internet of Drones (IoD) refers to a robust mobile network with well-defined airways where drones perform interoperable services, enhancing the deployment of Smart Cities. Automatic Drone Identification (ADI) is a protection mechanism to detect and avoid malicious drones, where different techniques have been used, such as acoustic signals. In this field, the sound generated by propellers and motors has particular characteristics, being a potential aspect to explore; however, this investigation is still missing. This study examines the use of rhythm-based descriptors as input features to ADI, based on the hypothesis that the acoustic signal generated by different drones has different rhythmic properties. Aiming to explore and validate our approach, we formulate an ADI methodology using rhythm-based features. We use a freely available drone audio dataset, comparing our results with a baseline study. As a result, our classification model improves 3.47% the baseline binary classification and 2.97% the multiclass classification, reaching accuracy rates of 0.9985 and 0.9591, respectively. Although the improvements are narrow, they point out that acoustic features have a great potential to enhance ADI mainly in dense drone-based environments, where drone identification is an essential task.  © 2021 IEEE.},

Therefore, this article will present the application of the Brazilian Standard ABNT NBR ISO 37122: 2020 of Smart Cities Indicators at the UFPA Headquarters Campus, with the objective of verifying which Smart City indicators are already present on the Campus due to the development of an electric mobility R&D. In addition to being the first time this standard has been applied on Campus, this work is also the first to carry out such a survey. As a result, a checklist was generated, where it was possible to count 4 categories and 17 indicators present within the Campus. Thus, demonstrating that UFPA is starting its process of insertion in the concept of Smart Cities.},

In this context, the classification of Macrocauses can help governments better understand some aspects of public security related to the analysis of violent crimes in a state.

It is a time-consuming task, and different experts may have different views on the same case. With this in mind, in this work, we intend to assist these criminal experts by providing a predictive model that classifies the Macrocauses of crimes into a set of pre-defined types to guide the work of the experts and, as a consequence, to speed up the analysis and management processes. Thus, a feature preprocessing was performed in which three different classification techniques are analyzed.

 abstract = {The use of mobile devices while driving is one of the major causes of accidents. Thus, this paper aims to create a real-time system to alert drivers of inattention moments, and thus reduce the number of traffic accidents. For this, we use computer vision algorithms to determine the driver's gaze direction which, together with vehicle data such as speed and acceleration, infer whether the driver is distracted. The key idea is to calibrate the drive's head rotation thresholds as a function of vehicle speed and acceleration. If the vehicle is at low speed or low acceleration, the head rotation can be more pronounced. In addition to head rotation, we also use blind eye detection as a criterion for determining distraction. The system uses a temporal sliding window procedure to prevent oscillations between inattention and attention states. The implementation is based on hardware and software architectures composed of cost-effective and open source libraries. Experimental results in controlled and real environments show accurate results and quick detection time.  © 2021 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Emergency vehicles have been employed in rescue operations and supportive services, attending victims and managing critical situations in smart cities.

When such emergency vehicles are not equipped with GPS receivers, cameras can be used to view emergency signs printed on them, allowing indirect identification of emergency vehicles, although many complexities have to be considered when performing visual sensors-based tracking and monitoring. In this context, this paper proposes a mathematical model focused on the evaluation of the coverage efficiency of a group of visual sensors over moving vehicles, aimed at visual coverage of emergency signs. For that, vehicles, emergency signs and visual sensors are mathematically modelled in this paper, with coverage interactions among these elements being computed based on proposed geometry equations and algorithms. Doing so, the effectiveness of the positioning and configurations of visual sensors can be evaluated without requiring actual deployment, potentially reducing costs when assessing visual monitoring systems in this scenario.  © 2021 IEEE.},

 booktitle = {{International Conference on Model-Driven Engineering Languages and Systems}},

 pages = {672--677}, 
 abstract = {In Smart Cities, the city's IT infrastructure must facilitate the development, deployment and operation of smart city applications for a number of different application domains that need to access a variety of heterogeneous resources. Building these applications becomes a great challenge since: they are used on large scale systems, have dynamic behavior, must access heterogeneous resources, can share resources from different domains, and must deal with the semantics of different domains. In this sense, platforms are commonly used to support application development, but they do not reduce complexity, are generic and deal with resource abstractions, while applications deal with domain abstractions. To overcome this semantic gap, this work proposes the use of domain specific middleware (DSM) with support for the development of model-driven applications defined in terms of a domain specific modeling language (DSML). To facilitate the definition of languages in different domains and, consequently, the execution of applications built according to these languages, a meta-meta language was defined that wraps the generic concepts used for the management of several domains. Furthermore, operational semantics are represented by models that describe domain-specific operations. The set of these elements associated with a middleware built according to the model-driven approach is defined as Model-Driven Domain-Specific Middleware (MDDSM). Therefore, this work proposes an integrated architecture that combines the use of MD-DSM and a smart cities platform to provide a flexible, robust and complete approach to facilitating the creation and execution of applications for different smart city domains. Thus, in the context of Smart Cities, middleware must deal with both application domain-related abstractions and platform-related abstractions (resources). Furthermore, the use of the model-driven approach allows representing such abstractions and relating domain semantics to generic resources. As a result, we have the construction of middleware and related elements in different domains and associated with a smart cities platform, demonstrating the expressiveness of the proposed approach. © 2021 IEEE.},

 abstract = {The adoption of sensors-based monitoring approaches has opened up a range of possibilities for data recovery, distributed processing, and quality evaluations in urban scenarios. In this evolving scenario, efficient emergency management systems provides a fundamental service for modern cities, exploiting different sensing and processing technologies for the real-time handling of critical situations. Actually, such systems are expected to implement emergency detection, alerting and mitigation services in order to avoid or relieve the negative impacts of critical events on the inhabitants’ perceived quality of life. In this sense, after a critical event is properly detected, emergency vehicles may be dispatched as quickly as possible to respond to such detected situations, potentially reducing the probability of deaths and injuries. Therefore, this paper proposes a selection algorithm to dispatch emergency vehicles in smart cities, assuming that emergency alerts are dynamically released exploiting any support system. Then, dispatched vehicles are prioritized as they move on a city, by optimizing the operation of traffic lights. Such an optimization approach is implemented and evaluated using different simulation tools and programming libraries, providing important contributions to emergency management in smart cities.},

 abstract = {Assuring an efficient Quality of Service (QoS) for heterogeneous Internet of Things services is a challenge, mainly due to spectrum scarcity and bandwidth limitations on the radio access network. To solve these problems, efficient management of airtime per station (STA) is necessary. In this work, we propose a scheduler to perform dynamic network slicing in IEEE 802.11ah Networks. The proposed scheduler is based on virtualization technologies to assure QoS restrictions per slice and can be deployed in the Access Point (AP) or in a virtual machine connected to the AP. Network metrics are used to verify QoS violations per slice over time. Once a QoS restriction is detected, the scheduler performs a reallocation of resources re-configuring the Restricted Access Windows parameters that compose a slice, adjusting airtime per STA. To evaluate the proposed scheduler, we consider a dynamic policy. Simulation results in a smart city scenario show that the dynamic policy is able to scale the network and satisfies QoS slice requirements.},

One reason is that cities in the country are different in geography, development, economics, education, and technology environments. In the context of digital transformation, cities are promoting innovative trends by adopting smart cities initiatives, in which Information and Communication Technology (ICT) represents a transversal enabler. Studies and frameworks were applied worldwide to characterize cities' smartness, but few focused on ICT governance, especially in subnational governments. From this perspective, this research, based on the fundamentals of digital government, ICT governance, and smart cities, analyzed ICT governance requisites and practices in fifteen Brazilian municipalities best ranked in the Smart City Connected index. The methodology procedures encompassed cities' official websites and transparency portals searches and information requests based on Brazilian Access Information Law. The results evidenced that most Brazilian cities lack a smart city program approach, several cities did not implement ICT governance mechanisms and were not compliant with the Information Access Law, and ICT governance was not conceived as active transparency in some cities portals. Future studies should focus on developing an ICT governance catalog practices for Brazilian's smart cities and a methodology for ICT governance open database as a smart city approach. © 2021 ACM.},

With the evolution of Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) communication is becoming more prominent for safety and non-safety related applications. The V2V communication facilitates vehicles to interconnect with each other to support numerous applications that will be highly helpful for drivers and passenger's welfare. However, due to the extreme dynamic nature of transportation, the Vehicular Ad hoc Network (VANET) faces many challenges for transferring information among vehicles. Therefore, efficient clustering and dynamic routing are becoming a supreme area of improvement to increase the Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) and reduce the End-to-End delay for data transfer. In order to overcome the major obstacle, in this paper, we propose an intelligent self-learning approach-based hybrid clustering by integrating Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and dynamic Dijkstra routing for packet transfer between vehicles. Also, experiments were carried out to support the data transfer with the help of drones to provide higher coverage in high dynamic vehicle mobility scenarios. The proposed algorithm is modeled, trained, and tested for performance evaluations metrics such as Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR), End to End delay, CH selection delay.  © 2021 ACM.},

Cities will be composed by autonomous parts that communicate and provide services to each other. For instance, cars (autonomous or not) may be seen as a service that transports people from one point to another. Interactions between users and these kinds of services will grow, making it necessary to have digitization of all these parts of the Smart City. The Digital Twin (DT) concept proposes that real-world assets have a virtual representation connecting the physical world with the cyber world. This allows to track the whole life-cycle of this object as well as perform simulations with current or previously stored data. In this context, this work proposes the use of Digital Twin for enabling and supporting car-as-a-service (CaaS).

Therefore, these new modern centers’ administrators should apply smart governance techniques to manage the physical and data infrastructure and seek alignment with the global open data initiative. As a point of intersection between physical and data infrastructure, 3D models of cities have been playing an important role in people’s daily lives, being a fundamental element for several applications. In this context, CityGML, a semantic model for 3D data representation adopted by several cities, appears as a possible solution for modeling. This paper presents an approach of integrating open data in the semi-automatic generation of 3D models based on CityGML, “enriching” semantic information about the instances with the association with the OpenStreetMaps database. A case study was performed using data provided by the Municipality of Porto Alegre, BR. The model generated in CityGML goes through semantic, geometric, and schema level validations, proving the proposed approach’s feasibility.

This approach is important to make possible to execute applications, where low latency requirements are present. Thus, several works were dedicated to the study on how to search, index, and rank sensors to overcome these challenges. A method, called GoAT, is presented in this paper to rank sensors based on the theory of active perception. The solution was evaluated using four real datasets. Our results successfully demonstrate that the proposal solution can provide an interesting level of reliability of the utilization of sensor data. Furthermore, GoAT requires a low computational resource, and at the same time, reduces latency in the sensor selection process.

Over the years, the growth of data sources from distinct online social networks has enabled new perspectives to applications that provide mechanisms to aid in comprehension of how people displaces between different regions within a city. To support enterprises and governments better understand and compare distinct regions of a city, this work proposes a web application called PlaceProfile to perform visual profiling of city areas based on iconographic visualization and to label areas based on clustering algorithms. The visualization results are overlayered on Google Maps to enrich the map layout and aid analyst in understanding region profiling at a glance. Besides, PlaceProfile coordinates a radar chart with areas selected by the user to enable detailed inspection of the frequency of categories of points of interest (POIs). This linked views approach also supports clustering algorithms’ explainability by providing inspections of the attributes used to compute similarities.

 abstract = {Emerging Web applications based on distributed IoT sensor systems and machine intelligence, such as in smart city scenarios, have posed many challenges to network and processing infrastructures. For example, environment monitoring cameras generate massive data streams to event-based applications that require fast processing for immediate actions. Finding a missing person in public spaces is an example of these applications, since his/her location is a piece of perishable information. Recently, the integration of edge computing with machine intelligence has been explored as a promising strategy to interpret such massive data near the sensor and reduce the end-to-end latency of processing events. However, due to the limited capacity and heterogeneity of edge resources, the placement of task processing is not trivial, especially when applications have different quality of service (QoS) requirements. In this paper, we develop an algorithm to solve the optimization problem of allocating a set of nodes with sufficient processing capacity to execute a pipeline of tasks while minimizing the operational cost related to latency and energy and maximizing availability. We compare our algorithm with the resource allocation algorithms (first-fit, best-fit, and worst-fit), achieving a lower cost in scenarios with different nodes' heterogeneity. We also demonstrate that distributing processing across multiple edge nodes reduces latency and energy consumption and still improves availability compared to processing only in the cloud. © 2021 by SCITEPRESS Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

 abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) based applications have recently experienced a remarkable diffusion in many different contexts, such as automotive, e-health, public security, industrial applications, energy, and waste management. These kinds of applications are characterized by geographically distributed sensors that collect data to be processed through algorithms of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Due to the vast amount of data to be processed by AI algorithms and the severe latency requirements of some applications, the emerging Edge Computing paradigm may represent the preferable choice for the supporting infrastructure. However, the design of edge computing infrastructures opens several new issues concerning the allocation of data flows coming from sensors over the edge nodes, and the choice of the number and the location of the edge nodes to be activated. The service placement issue can be modeled through a multi-objective optimization aiming at minimizing two aspects: the response time for data transmission and processing in the sensors-edge-cloud path; the (energy or monetary) cost related to the number of turned on edge nodes. Two heuristics, based on Variable Neighborhood Search and on Genetic Algorithms, are proposed and evaluated over a wide range of scenarios, considering a realistic smart city application with 100 sensors and up to 10 edge nodes. Both heuristics can return practical solutions for the given application. The results indicate a suitable topology for a network-bound scenario requires less enabled edge nodes comparatively with a CPU-bound scenario. In terms of performance gain, the VNS outperformed in almost every condition the GA approach, reaching a performance gain up to almost 40% when the network delay plays a significant role and when the load is higher. Hence, the experimental tests demonstrate that the proposed heuristics are useful to support the design of edge computing infrastructures for modern AI-based applications relying on data collected by geographically distributed IoT sensors. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

In order to do that, sensors are displayed in a grid, taking into consideration limits of the technology and the area of the urban forest. Besides, an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is used to collect the data generated by the sensors and the UAV battery is also considered for making feasible solutions closer to the real scenario, as the urban forests usually have big areas. An integer programming formulation is proposed, along side with a metaheuristic. The proposed metaheuristic framework is used for finding solutions for the proposed optimization problem. Experiments show that the integer programming formulation failed to obtain feasible solution in the given timelimit, while the GRASP methodology was able obtained solution in at most, 20 s.

Recently, improved efficiency in WLAN-based dense scenarios has become widespread through Wi-Fi 6, a license-free spectrum technology that can complement the cellular-based infrastructure for IoV. In addition, Named Data Networking (NDN) is a promising Internet architecture to accomplish content distribution in dynamic IoV scenarios. However, NDN deployments, i.e., native (clean-slate) and overlay (running on top of IP stack), require further investigation of their performance over wireless networks, particularly regarding the IoV scenario. This paper performs a comparative simulation-based study of these NDN deployments over Wi-Fi 6 for IoV using real vehicular traces. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort that extends ndnSIM 2 with an overlay-based NDN implementation and that compares it with the native approach. Results show that the overlay-based NDN consistently outperforms the native one, reaching around 99% of requests satisfied, against only 42.35% in the best case of native deployment. © 2022, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.},

The purpose of this article is to identify and map the existing relationships between the indicators of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) for smart cities with the Multivariate Linear Regression through scripts written in Python language. To achieve the functions that describe such relationships, data from the 5,570 Brazilian cities were collected, concerning their population and 24 maturity indicators for smart cities. A previous analysis was carried out for identifying, among all the collected indicators, those with stronger relevance in Brazilian scenario to improve the cities’ maturity, resulting in four indicators that were further examined. Thus, the current work aimed to collect and analyze data related to the development of cities to explore a methodology that make possible a more assertive direction for the use of the available resources in order to reach the predetermined goals. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

 abstract = {Urban traffic simulations are of great importance for smart cities research. However, city-scale simulators can be both process and memory-intensive, and hard to scale. To speed up these simulations and to allow the execution of larger scenarios, this work presents a set of optimizations based on two complementary approaches. The first is an approach inspired by SimPoint to estimate the results of new simulations using previous simulations. This technique consists of identifying and clustering recurring patterns during a simulation, and then using a representative (the centroid of the cluster) of the recurring patterns to reconstruct the remaining ones. On a dataset with 216 time series, our technique was able to estimate the original series (of the same simulation) with an average error of 6.38 × 10- 6. Using only the trips which include the centroids (50% of the total simulation), estimation of metrics such as average speed and percentage of street occupancy rate, presented errors of 1.2% and 30% respectively, with a speedup of 1.95 in execution time. The second approach works on a lower level. In this approach we explore alternative implementations to Erlang’s ETS tables, a central data structure used by the InterSCity simulator, and a current performance bottleneck. These optimizations yielded a speedup of approximately 1.28 when compared to the current version of the simulator. © 2022, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

This issue gets worse when there are priority vehicles, such as ambulances, trying to move through the traffic. Given the current situation, with the COVID-19 pandemic, and the trends of smart cities, in this work, we propose and simulate a traffic control system that prioritizes ambulances within large urban centers, using Fuzzy logic and IoT devices. The simulation of our proposed model was performed on the software Dojot, which is an open platform for IoT modeling. It addressed a real situation, in a path that is usually used by ambulances to get to a reference hospital in the city of Campinas, Brazil.

 abstract = {Art graffiti can be considered as a type of urban street art which is actually present in most cities worldwide. Many artists who began as street artists have successfully moved to mainstream art, including art galleries. In consequence, the artistic graffiti produced by these authors became valuable works which are part of the cultural heritage in cities. When understanding the economic value of these public art initiatives within the smart cities context, the preservation of artistic graffiti (mainly, against vandalism) becomes essential. This fact will make it possible for municipal governments and urban planners to implement such graffiti maintenance initiatives in the future. In this context, this paper describes a deep learning-based methodology to accurately detect urban graffiti in complex images. The different graffiti varieties (i.e., 3D, stencil or wildstyle, among others) and the multiple variabilities present in these artistic elements on street scenes (such as partial occlusions or their reduced size) make this object detection problem challenging. Our experimental results using different datasets endorse the effectiveness of this proposal. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

 abstract = {Smart Cities use a variety of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and databases to improve the efficiency and efficacy of city services. Security is one of the main topics of interest in this context. The increase in crime rates demands the development of new solutions for detecting possible violent situations. Video surveillance (CCTV) cameras can provide a large amount of valuable information contained in images which can be difficult to be analyzed by humans in an efficient form. Identifying and classifying weapons in such images is a challenging problem that can be driven by the application of Deep Learning techniques. Object detection algorithms, especially advanced Machine Learning ones, have demonstrated impressive results in a wide range of applications. However, they can fail in certain application scenarios. This work describes a novel proposal for knife detection in complex images. This is a challenging problem due to the multiple variabilities of these objects in scenes (i.e., changing shapes, sizes and illumination conditions, among others), which can negatively impact the performance of mentioned algorithms. Our approach analyzed the combination two super-resolution techniques (as a preprocessing stage) with one object detection network to effectively solve the considered problem. The results of our experiments show that the proposed methodology can produce better results when detecting small objects having reflecting surfaces (i.e., knives) in scenes. Moreover, the approach could be adapted for surveillance applications that need real-time detection of knives in places monitored by cameras. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

 abstract = {Pedestrian detection is a critical problem in many areas, such as smart cities, surveillance, monitoring, autonomous driving, and robotics. AI-based methods have made tremendous progress in the field in the last few years, but good performance is limited to data that match the training datasets. We present a multi-camera 3D pedestrian detection method that does not need to be trained using data from the target scene. The core idea of our approach consists in formulating consistency in multiple views as a graph clique cover problem. We estimate pedestrian ground location on the image plane using a novel method based on human body poses and person’s bounding boxes from an off-the-shelf monocular detector. We then project these locations onto the ground plane and fuse them with a new formulation of a clique cover problem from graph theory. We propose a new vertex ordering strategy to define fusion priority based on both detection distance and vertex degree. We also propose an optional step for exploiting pedestrian appearance during fusion by using a domain-generalizable person re-identification model. Finally, we compute the final 3D ground coordinates of each detected pedestrian with a method based on keypoint triangulation. We evaluated the proposed approach on the challenging WILDTRACK and MultiviewX datasets. Our proposed method significantly outperformed state of the art in terms of generalizability. It obtained a MODA that was approximately 15% and 2% better than the best existing generalizable detection technique on WILDTRACK and MultiviewX, respectively. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

A significant amount of IoT devices is expected to join the network as IoT has allowed interconnection and transmission among global devices which has resulted in generation of enormous diverse data. There is a requirement for a real-time, latency-specific, and network efficient computing paradigm in 5G-enabled smart city infrastructure. Fog computing presents trustworthy solutions to tackle these issues by combining edge users. They store, control, communicate, configure, measure, and manage big data produced by IoT devices. In this survey, the authors have performed a comprehensive study on fog computing and have classified various such paradigms. The authors have performed an extensive evaluation of features, along with the algorithmic and architectural packages deployed in the framework. This survey covers various 5G-enabled Industrial IoT (I-IoT) application settings and unleashes various fog framework-based solutions for numerous real-world application challenges in sustainable smart city infrastructures. Numerous contributions of fog computing towards latency-sensitive applications like healthcare 4.0, smart conveyance, smart waste management, smart energy handling, etc. has also been discussed. Fog computing framework apart from the abilities, also inherits various security flaws from cloud computing paradigm, and these flaws needs to be rectified in the interest of the end user.

IoT management approaches focus on devices and connectivity, thus lacking a comprehensive understanding of the different software, hardware, and communication components that comprise an IoT-based solution. This paper proposes a novel four-layer IoT Management Architecture (IoTManA) that encompasses various aspects of a distributed infrastructure for managing, controlling, and monitoring software, hardware, and communication components, as well as dataflows and data quality. Our architecture provides a cross-layer graph-based view of the end-to-end path between devices and the cloud. IoTManA has been implemented in a set of software components named IoT management system (IoTManS) and tested in two scenarios—Smart Agriculture and Smart Cities—showing that it can significantly contribute to harnessing the complexity of managing IoT solutions. The cross-layer graph-based modeling of IoTManA facilitates the implemented management system (IoTManS) to detect and identify root causes of typically distributed failures occurring in IoT solutions. We conducted a performance analysis of IoTManS focusing on two aspects—failure detection time and scalability—to demonstrate application scenarios and capabilities. The results show that IoTManS can detect and identify the root cause of failures in 806ms to 90,036ms depending on its operation mode, adapting to different IoT needs. Also, the IoTManS scalability is directly proportional to the scalability of the underlying IoT Platform, managing up to 5,000 components simultaneously. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

 abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) has been a hot topic in both academia and industry for the last few years. There are many possible applications, in fields as smart cities, home automation, smart buildings, agriculture, automated metering, logistic, industrial automation, among others. Such a wide range of applications resulted in various technological solutions in order to enable Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications, in which we highlight those for wide area networks. In that sense, two widely used sub-GHz protocols for Low Power Wide Area (LPWA) communications are: Long Range (LoRa), using the upper layers defined by Long Range Wide Area Network (LoRaWAN); and IEEE 802.15.4g, using the upper layers defined by IPv6 over the Time-Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH) mode of IEEE 802.15.4e (6TiSCH). While LoRaWAN is a well-known and widespread protocol, 6TiSCH offers IPv6 connectivity to LPWA networks and is used in important standards such as Wireless Smart Ubiquitous Network (Wi-SUN). This paper aims at determining how well each protocol scales, analyzing different aspects such as packet loss, delay, and the maximum number of nodes per square area. In order to achieve such results, computer simulations are performed using open-source simulators. The obtained results demonstrate that the best scalability depends on which scenarios are considered. For scenarios with multiple gateways requiring low latency or low packet transmission rates, LoRaWAN demonstrates better results. However, in scenarios with high packet transmission rates and where the latency is not a major concern, 6TiSCH is more appropriate. Moreover, even in the best case, the latency associated with the LoRaWAN technology may be considerably smaller than associated with 6TiSCH. Such novelty results are obtained in a fair and realistic way and, noting that both technologies could be used to build LPWA networks, it can help system designers to decide between the two technologies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {In the last few years, visual sensors are deployed almost everywhere, generating a massive amount of surveillance video data in smart cities that can be inspected intelligently to recognize anomalous events. In this work, we present an efficient and robust framework to recognize anomalies from surveillance Big Video Data (BVD) using Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). Smart surveillance is an important application of AIoT and we propose a two-stream neural network in this direction. The first stream comprises instant anomaly detection that is functional over resource-constrained IoT devices, whereas second phase is a two-stream deep neural network allowing for detailed anomaly analysis, suited to be deployed as a cloud computing service. Firstly, a self-pruned fine-tuned lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) classifies the ongoing events as normal or anomalous in an AIoT environment. Upon anomaly detection, the edge device alerts the concerned departments and transmits the anomalous frames to cloud analysis center for their detailed evaluation in the second phase. The cloud analysis center resorts to the proposed two-stream network, modeled from the integration of spatiotemporal and optical flow features through the sequential frames. Fused features flow through a bi-directional long short-term memory (BD-LSTM) layer, which classifies them into their respective anomaly classes, e.g., assault and abuse. We perform extensive experiments over benchmarks built on top of the UCF-Crime and RWF-2000 datasets to test the effectiveness of our framework. We report a 9.88% and 4.01% increase in accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art methods evaluated over the aforementioned datasets. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques present powerful frameworks for optimizing traffic signal controllers that learn to respond to real-time traffic changes. Multiagent RL (MARL) techniques have been showing better results over centralized techniques (RL-based or not), where local intersection agents have partial observation of and control over the environment. Since in TSC the best decision does not depend only on local information, in the present paper we aim at increasing agents’ views by using a hierarchical approach, where information is passed upwards, is then aggregated forming recommendations that are sent downwards. We divide the transportation network into regions, each controlled by a region agent; this is done at different hierarchical levels. The traffic signal controllers, located at the intersections, are the local agents at the hierarchy’s bottom. Region agents can supervise intersection agents or other region agents. Evaluation of this approach in a synthetic traffic grid shows that the proposed hierarchical organization outperforms a fixed-time approach and an RL-based approach without hierarchy.},

 abstract = {With the breakthroughs in capabilities of mobile and embedded devices which allows them to become part of our everyday lives, and the subsequent advent of fields such as Internet of Things, Smart Cities and Ambient Intelligence, the process of exploiting individual device functionalities to create complex services, known as service composition, gains more traction. However, to perform service composition in such dynamic environments, where availability of resources is far from uncertain, there are many challenges that must be overcome. The way the human brain works allows it to configure itself to perform specific tasks, just like a service composition arranges a set of services to achieve a goal, and is capable to adapt to changes in its environment, providing us with a great degree of resilience, something very valuable for dealing with dynamic environments. In this work, we propose a model whereby the various modules of the Cuāyōllōtl Biologically Inspired Cognitive Architecture (BICA), which will be in charge of managing the different devices of a pervasive system, are to be configured to create a workflow that employs only the required modules to achieve an objective, in a similar fashion to how conventional service composition approaches produce composite services. © 2022 Elsevier B.V..

Findings: In this case study, the robustness of the objective function is above 99.99%. The robustness for the number of covered demand points is 88.93%, and the frequency associated with every candidate is between 11.71% and 69.49%.

The extensive use of GNSSs in a wide range of applications has caused their migration from the professional segment to the mass-market segment in terms of both technology and performance. This presents new and more stringent requirements in terms of accuracy, robustness, ubiquity, and continuity for the original “open sky” GNSS design.

This evolution is considered in this paper with the aim of providing a unified reference for current GNSS receiver technologies and solutions and its expected evolution in the next decade.

 abstract = {In the industry 4.0 era, the visualization and real-time automatic monitoring of smart cities supported by the Internet of Things is becoming increasingly important. The use of filtering algorithms in smart city monitoring is a feasible method for this purpose. However, maintaining fast and accurate monitoring in complex surveillance environments with restricted resources remains a major challenge. Since the cognitive theory in visual monitoring is difficult to realize in practice, efficient monitoring of complex environments is accordingly hard to be achieved. Moreover, current monitoring methods do not consider the particularities of the human cognitive system, so the remonitoring ability of the process/target is weak in case of monitoring failure by the monitoring system. To overcome these issues, this article proposes a novel human short-long cognitive memory mechanism for video surveillance in smart cities. In this mechanism, a memory with a high reliability target is used as a “long-term memory,” whereas a memory with a low reliability target is used as a “short-term memory.” During the monitoring process, the “short-term memory” and “long-term memory” alternation strategy is combined with the stored target appearance characteristics, ensuring that the original model in the memory will not be contaminated or mislaid by changes in the external environment (occlusion, fast motion, motion blur, and background clutter). Extensive simulations showcase that the algorithm proposed in this article not only improves the monitoring speed without hindering its real-time operation but also monitors and traces the monitored target accurately, ultimately improving the robustness of the detection in complex scenery, and enabling its application to IoT-assisted smart cities.},

 abstract = {We consider the design of distributed algorithms that govern the manner in which agents contribute to a social sensing platform. Specifically, we are interested in situations, where fairness among the agents contributing to the platform is needed. A notable example is the platforms operated by public bodies, where fairness is a legal requirement. The design of such distributed systems is challenging due to the fact that we wish to simultaneously realize an efficient social sensing platform but also deliver a predefined quality of service to the agents (for example, a fair opportunity to contribute to the platform). In this article, we introduce iterated function systems (IFSs) as a tool for the design and analysis of systems of this kind. We show how the IFS framework can be used to realize systems that deliver a predictable quality of service to agents, can be used to underpin contracts governing the interaction of agents with the social sensing platform, and which are efficient. To illustrate our design via a use case, we consider a large, high-density network of participating parked vehicles. When awoken by an administrative center, this network proceeds to search for moving missing entities of interest using RFID-based techniques. We regulate which vehicles are actively searching for the moving entity of interest at any point in time. In doing so, we seek to equalize vehicular energy consumption across the network. This is illustrated through simulations of a search for a missing Alzheimer’s patient in Melbourne, Australia. The experimental results are presented to illustrate the efficacy of our system and the predictability of access of agents to the platform independent of initial conditions.},

 abstract = {People use smart transportation systems to move around in smart cities, producing a massive amount of valuable mobility data. Although this characteristic enables the development of many intelligent applications, it can expose users to privacy threats. Location privacy is an issue addressed in many mobility contexts, in which there is a privacy concern. Currently, there are some proposals to tackle this problem, and some questions naturally arise: Are these proposals suitable for a dynamic environment, such as smart mobility? What are the impacts of mobility on privacy? In this article, we answer these questions to explore location privacy in smart mobility considering open and online data, one of the fundamental pillars of smart city platforms. We have evidenced the hypothesis that mobility can impact privacy approaches of anonymization (mix zones) and obfuscation (GEO-I) in the context of smart mobility. For this, we performed experiments to characterize and find similarities in the statistical distributions extracted from two stay points metrics, which operate as substrates to build location privacy protection mechanisms. We use an accuracy metric to quantify the datasets’ distributions that matched each other. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of seven real datasets of mono or multimodal mobility. The results showed that the stay point count metric reached 100% and 83.3% accuracy for coarse-grained (person and vehicle) and fine-grained (bus, taxi, and person) data. Additionally, we show a similarity between distributions for the same vehicle type for mono and multimodal datasets. Results suggest that privacy has a high dependence on mobility in different granularity levels.},

Digitalization of the real world enables new business models, transforming traditional products into services, as for instance, the Car-as-a-Service (CaaS). To integrate all components that will be part of systems like CaaS or Smart Cities, it is necessary to have well-defined standards for modeling and defining an architecture especially taking into consideration the granularity level of the system.

Overwhelming growth in computer vision fields has been made to automate the surveillance system in terms of human activity recognition, such as behavior analysis and violence detection (VD). However, it is challenging to detect and analyze the violent scenes intelligently to fulfill the notion of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)-based surveillance buoyed by constrained resources to reduce computational power. To tackle this challenge, in this article, an artificial intelligence enabled IIoT-based framework with VD-Network (VD-Net) is proposed. First, the input video frames are passed to light-weight convolutional neural network model for important information collection including humans or suspicious objects such as knives/guns. Upon suspicious object detection, an alert is generated as an earlier VD in IIoT network while the information is shared with concern departments. Only the frames with objects are forwarded to cloud for detail investigation where features are extracted using convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM). The latter from ConvLSTM is propagated to gated recurrent unit for final VD. The conducted experiments and ablation study on the existing surveillance and nonsurveillance datasets empirically validate the effectiveness of the proposed VD-Net by improving 3.9% increase in the accuracy compared with the state-of-the-art VD methods.  © 2005-2012 IEEE.},

We describe our user community identification framework in detail including how mobility features can be extracted from real mobility traces (as examples of unlabelled data) and synthetic mobility records (as examples of labeled data). We present results obtained when using our approach in four distinct mobility scenarios represented by both unlabeled and labeled datasets. We also introduce a new validation methodology that uses image-based similarity metrics in order to assess the quality of identified communities. Our results show that the proposed approach significantly increases similarity between users within the same community as well as dissimilarity between users in different communities.

An urban area is divided into multiple regions, and each region is sub-divided into a finite number of zones. At each zone an optimal number of RSUs are installed along with the edge computing devices. The MAS deployed at each RSU collects a huge volume of data from the various sensors, devices, and infrastructures. The edge computing device uses the collected raw data from the MAS to process, analyze, and predict. The predicted information will be shared with the neighborhood RSUs, vehicles, and cloud by using MAS with the help of IoT. The predicted information can be used by freight vehicles to maintain smooth and steady movement, which results in reduction in GHG emissions and energy consumption, and finally improves the freight vehicles’ mileage by reducing traffic congestion in the urban areas.

For this reason, offload tasks or data to other layers such as fog or cloud is regularly adopted to smooth out this issue.

Therefore, we propose OffFog - an approach to guide the definition of data offloading policies in the context of fog computing. In order to evaluate OffFog, we extended the well-known simulator iFogSim and conducted an experimental study based on an urban surveillance system. The results demonstrated the benefits of implementing data offloading based on OffFog recommended policies. Furthermore, we identified the best configuration involving design decisions such as data compression, data criticality, and storage thresholds. The best configuration produced at least 76% improvement in network latency and 5% in the average execution time compared to the iFogSim default strategy. We believe these results represent a significant step towards establishing a systematic decision framework for data offloading policies in the context of fog computing.  © 2022 Sávio Melo et al.},

Although visual data may be central for a considerable set of applications in areas such as Smart Cities, Industry 4.0, and Vehicular Networks, the actual visual data quality may be not easily determined since it may be associated with many factors that depend on the characteristics of the considered application scenario. This entails several aspects from the quality of captured images (sharpness, definition, resolution) to the characteristics of the networks such as employed hardware, power consumption, and networking efficiency. In order to better support quality analysis and performance comparisons among different wireless visual sensor networks, which could be valuable in many monitoring scenarios, this article surveys this area with special concern on assessment mechanisms and quality metrics. In this context, a novel classification approach is proposed to better categorize the diverse applicable metrics for quality assessment of visual monitoring procedures. Hence, this article yields a practical guide for analyzing different visual sensor network implementations, allowing fairer evaluations and comparisons among a variety of research works. Critical analysis are also performed regarding the relevance and usage of the proposed categories and identified quality metrics. Finally, promising open issues and research directions are discussed in order to guide new developments in this research field. © 2022 by the authors.},

 abstract = {Data obtained from sensors connected to wireless sensor networks must be stored and processed to enable environments such as smart cities. However, with the exponential growth in the number of devices at the edge of the network, it is necessary to implement robust techniques, capable of selecting reliable data sources and meeting low latency requirements, in order to serve critical applications. Thus, to overcome these challenges, this research work presents FOCUSeR, a method for ranking sensors. The method uses the evaluation of data as a criterion for the ranking, allowing us to identify occurrences of failures in sensors and anomalies in environments. In order to meet the requirements inherent to WSNs, the proposed method was developed to run in a fog computing environment, using online learning and constant updating over time to avoid effects such as time drift. The generated ranking lists are managed through distributed hash tables. To provide reliability to the experimental results, a real experimental environment was developed. Moreover, using this developed testbed, a dataset with labels was created, to support the evaluation of the method. In addition, four other real datasets were used, three of which were labeled through artificial fault injection. These datasets were labeled in a related work that focused on injecting artificial faults. The experimental results obtained demonstrate that the proposed approach can provide reliability in the use of sensor data, using low computational resources and reducing latency in the sensor selection process. Precision rates are approximately 98% and Accuracy rates are greater than 94% across all datasets. In addition, the analyses carried out show that the Accuracy has an increasing rate as the number of samples also increases. Results obtained in the failure data recovery also demonstrate the feasibility of the proposal in this resource. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

The IoT infrastructure is often used to collect a large amount of data to meet the business demands of Smart Cities, Industry 4.0, and Smart Home, but there is a opportunity to use these data to intrinsically monitor an IoT system in an autonomous way. A Test Driven Development (TDD) approach for automatic module assessment for ESP32 and ESP8266 IoT development devices based on unsupervised Machine Learning (ML) is proposed to monitor IoT device status. A framework consisting of business drivers, non-functional requirements, engineering view, dynamic system evaluation, and recommendations phases is proposed to be used with the TDD development tool. The proposal is evaluated in academic and smart home study cases with 25 devices, consisting of 15 different firmware versions collected in one week, with a total of over 550,000 IoT status readings. The K-Means algorithm was applied to free memory available, internal temperature, and Wi-Fi level metrics to automatically monitor the IoT devices under development to identify device constraints violation and provide insights for monitoring frequency configuration of different firmware versions. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, it is the first TDD approach for IoT module automatic assessment which uses machine learning based on the real testbed data. The IoT status monitoring and the Python scripts for model training and inference with K-Means algorithm are available under a Creative Commons license. © 2022 by the authors.},

In this scope the aerial platform has embedded a set of cameras able to collect the image of the electrical asset, e.g., power line poles, lightning rod, rust/corrosion, damaged bolts and others, using thermal or regular cameras. The power line inspection process considers the Drone scanning the field, to identify the targets, doing the pattern recognition and other automatic procedures according to each operational scope and I.A. procedures, in order to increase the power lines maintenance process effectiveness.

However, integrating new protocols and applications can impose additional overhead, hindering the platform’s overall performance and scalability. This study provides an insight into the trade-off between interoperability and performance of IoT platforms. First, we present a qualitative analysis of three open-source platforms - FIWARE, ThingsBoard, and Konker - analyzing their interoperability features. Second, we conduct a performance evaluation emulating two IoT-based environments, smart cities and smart health, to understand each platform’s scalability, response time, and computer resource usage. Finally, we analyze the possible trade-offs between interoperability features and scalability based on the qualitative and quantitative analysis.

Despite all the progress already made, the vast majority of solutions have not met the requirements of Applications’ Runtime, Development, and Deployment when related to Scalability. Some studies point out that just 1 of 97 (1%) reported platforms reach this all this set of requirements at same time. This small number of platforms may be explained by some reasons: i) Big Data: The huge amount of processed and stored data with various data sources and data types, ii) Multi-domains: many domains involved (Economy, Traffic, Health, Security, Agronomy, etc.), iii) Multiple processing methods like Data Flow, Batch Processing, Services, and Microservices, and 4) High Distributed Degree: The use of multiple IoT and BigData tools combined with execution at various computational levels (Edge, Fog, Cloud) leads applications to present a high level of distribution. Aware of those great challenges, we propose Sapparchi, an integrated architectural model for Smart Cities applications that defines multi-processing levels (Edge, Fog, and Cloud). Also, it presents the Sapparchi middleware platform for developing, deploying, and running applications in the smart city environment with an osmotic multi-processing approach that scales applications from Cloud to Edge.

 abstract = {Internet of Drones (IoD) is an architecture that aims to enable different drones to share the same airspace. This architecture can help coordinate drone access to airspace in urban environments. Considering that the IoD is a dynamic network, it is possible to have scenarios in which drone traffic is sparse when, for instance, the network has isolated drones. In this case, the drones’ communication range does not reach any other drone. Thus, store-carry-forward protocols may be suitable for maintaining network communication. Moreover, different networks can collaborate to fill these communication gaps. In this study, we explore the collaboration between IoD and Bus Networks. Our analysis shows that maintaining a hybrid communication between drones and buses can fill the gaps in the communication between drones. The main goal of this work is to present the IoDSCF, a store-carry-forward routing protocol for joint Bus Networks and the Internet of Drones (IoD). IoDSCF takes advantage of both networks to extend the communication reachability. Our results reveal that IoDSCF presents better results in the number of delivered packets and end-to-end delay than a solution based only on communication between drones. This is a promising strategy for data communication, mainly in smart cities.},

 abstract = {Among the innovative services provided by smart cities initiatives, emergencies management systems have stood out as a mean to prevent the occurrence of disasters in urban areas, detecting emergencies as soon as possible and triggering response actions. For that, such systems may rely on multiple emergencies detection units spread over a city, which will be used to detect abnormal situations and report them for further processing. Although the use of multi-sensors hardware units seems to be reasonable to detect a lot of emergency-related variables such as temperature, humidity, smoke, and toxic gases, cities may have different geographical zones concerning the potential negative impacts (risk) that an emergency may have until it is properly mitigated. Therefore, such risk associated to those zones should guide the deployment of emergencies detection units, but their computation is not straightforward and it may depend on different parameters. In this context, this paper proposes a mathematical model to compute mitigation zones in any city, taking as reference the availability of response centers retrieved from open geospatial databases, notably hospitals, fire departments, and police stations. An algorithm is defined to compute a critical index to each zone, which will be exploited to indicate the proportional number of detection units that should be allocated according to the total number of available units. Initial results for the city of Porto, Portugal, are presented, which are discussed when concerning the construction of practical emergencies management systems.  © 2022 IEEE.},

 abstract = {The use of a mobile sink in wireless sensor networks has been a game changing to enable the development of smart cities applications. The mobility feature allows more effective data gathering and energy saving in the network, since the sink can be closer to source nodes, which could activate their radios only when the sink approximates. Doing so, more efficient settings can be achieved when configuring and deploying sensor nodes for a myriad of applications. However, this mobility-centric strategy can generate applications scenarios with large delays when sensor networks are monitoring the environment, which may result in considerable data losses in critical applications. To cope with that, this paper proposes an algorithm to dynamically plan the repositioning of a single mobile sink within distributed sensing applications. The algorithm considers dependability requirements associated with network connectivity, operability, and energy consumption, implicitly minimizing the energy-hole problem and connectivity issues. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate how the can be applied to move the sink through the network meeting dependability requirements.  © 2022 IEEE.},

Despite the recent evolution of HetVNETs, points related to security, data integrity and privacy are still open issues, since there is no standard to achieve trust among the network nodes. A promising approach to achieve trust is the usage of a reputation system, that monitors the behavior of network nodes to determine its trustworthiness. However, this de-termination is complex, because the uncertainty coming from the HetVNETs features, such as fast mobile nodes, self-organization, unstable communication links and frequently changing topology. Within this context, this paper presents a reputation system for HetVNETs, called TrustV, to perform a faster and reliable determination of network nodes trustworthiness based on game theory, as well as the long-term and short-term communication technologies of HetVNETs. The game theory approach allows TrustV to overcome the uncertain issues of HetVNETs, since the modeling of the cooperation as a game can identify selfish and malicious nodes during the time. The results suggest that the TrustV achieves a very high cooperation rate between vehicles at Het VNETs, even as it is capable to detect selfish and malicious nodes as well as black hole and grey hole attacks.  © 2022 IEEE.},

 abstract = {To make cities smarter has become a worldwide purpose as predicted in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. In modern power systems, reliability and self-sustainability are crucial requirements. This paper assesses the ability of a real microgrid to operate in islanded mode when a failure of any nature takes place. The circuit analyzed belongs to the satellite city of Taguatinga, located in the suburban area of Brasilia, the Brazilian Capital City. The city electrical data make Taguatinga similar to large cities in the Brazilian context. This work presents the electricity data, as voltage levels, consumption and, local distributed generations. The purpose is to propose solutions for technical, regulatory, and social issues needed to make the city, at least, four days electrically self-sustainable. It was concluded that a tremendous global effort, including government, regulators, and society, will be necessary to make any Brazilian city a smart city, electrically leastwise.},

 abstract = {In surveillance systems, vast amounts of data are collected from different sources to monitor ongoing video activities. Usually, video data is passively captured by visual sensors and forwarded to the command center, without intelligent Edge functionalities to select essential video information and locally detect abnormal events therein. These shortcomings often seen in practical surveillance scenarios lead to a wastage of storage resources and make data management, retrieval, and informed decision complex and time-consuming. Therefore, endowing visual sensors with video summarization capabilities is of utmost importance for smarter surveillance systems. This study departs from this rationale to propose an efficient neural networks-based video summarization method for surveillance systems. The proposed approach learns how to optimally segment a video by measuring informative features from the data flow, followed by memorability and entropy to maintain the relevance and diversity of the video summary produced on the Edge. Experimental results over benchmark datasets reveal that the proposed scheme outperforms other state-of-the-art counterparts and proves the effectiveness of our method for video summarization in smart cities. © 2022 IEEE.},

However, these services yield massive and unrestricted mobility data of citizens that pose privacy concerns, among them recovering the identity of citizens with linking attacks. Although several privacy mechanisms have been proposed to solve anonymization problems, there are few studies about their behavior and analysis of the data quality anonymized by these techniques. In this paper, we introduce the anonymization quality. For this, we propose analyzing the mix-zones metrics Amount of Cars on Mix-zone (ACM), Interval of Arrival Time between Cars on Mix-zones (ITM), and Activation Time of the Mix-zone (ATM) for characterizing and evaluating the impacts of anonymization quality over time and space in mobility data. The results showed that mix-zone metrics reflect anonymization behavior and can measure the anonymization quality over time. This insight can contribute significantly to building privacy proposes based on anonymization more effectively than based only on traffic flow. To our knowledge, this is the first work that uses mix-zones metrics analysis to observe the anonymization behavior in quality terms.  © 2022 ACM.},

Vendors are developing low-power, efficient, and low-cost dedicated accelerators to allow the execution of the computational-demanding CNNs even in embedded applications with strict power and cost budgets.Google's Coral Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) is one of the latest low power accelerators for CNNs. In this paper we investigate the reliability of TPUs to atmospheric neutrons, reporting experimental data equivalent to more than 30 million years of natural irradiation. We analyze the behavior of TPUs executing atomic operations (standard or depthwise convolutions) with increasing input sizes as well as eight CNN designs typical of embedded applications, including transfer learning and reduced data-set configurations. We found that, despite the high error rate, most neutrons-induced errors only slightly modify the convolution output and do not change the CNNs detection or classification. By reporting details about the fault model and error rate, we provide valuable information on how to evaluate and improve the reliability of CNNs executed on a TPU.},

 abstract = {Nowadays, drones or Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are employed for several purposes such as delivering products, spreading pesticides on crops, providing internet access to remote areas, and taking videos and photos for entertainment. In the context of smart cities it is not different. Some cities have adopted drones for a number of important tasks, such as surveillance, traffic monitoring, and disaster management. Indeed, their ability of reaching difficult places and the possibility of carrying different sensors and actuators make those devices very flexible tools that can adapt to several use cases. Nevertheless, there are still obstacles — technical, regulatory or even social — that can hinder the applicability of drones to certain tasks. In this work, we report and analyze the use of drones by the Civil Defense Office of the city of Niterói, Brazil, as a case study. In recent years, the office has been increasingly adopting drones for automatizing or simplifying a number of processes with varying degrees of success, and intend to adopt information and knowledge management systems to support and optimize their use. We present a list of the current drone-aided tasks performed by the office, as well some potential applications that are not yet feasible for one reason or another. We further analyze those obstacles and discuss what can be done to address them. Copyright © 2022 by SCITEPRESS Science and Technology Publications, Lda. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {There is no consensus on what it means to be a Smart City. Nonetheless, many cities around the world are adopting Smart City initiatives; Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) seem to be the common denominator of all these initiatives. But smart cities should evolve not only in technology but also in sustainable development that supports life quality. Sustainability can be measured by goals provided by the UN and also by indexes such as ISO 37.120:2014. Life quality can be defined by indexes as well, such as the Human Development Index (HDI) or any of several Urban Quality of Life (UQoL) indexes. So an index that measures "smartness"of a city is by necessity quite complex. To get a better sense of the indicators (or themes) such an index should include, we analyzed five indexes: one index of sustainability, one of life quality and three indexes for smart cities. We compared these in terms of the indicators or themes they addressed and then we surveyed the websites of 35 smart city initiatives to see for each indicator / theme we identified how many smart city initiatives considered it. We found that the themes that appeared in the highest number of indexes were also most frequent in smart city initiatives of the cities studied, and also that cities are convergent with tackling the same problems of society nowadays. © by the International Institute of Informatics and Systemics.},

Smart Cities emerge from joining two development urban streams: (i) the cities’ redefinition from Information Technology and communications perspective; and (ii) from understanding the city as a space for creativity and innovation. It is known that applications developed for Smart Cities can highly facilitate urban management, in addition to increasing the population’s quality of life. However, to achieve a maturity stage, many technical and scientific challenges have to be met before those applications can be widely used.

Methods and architectures for the scenario of smart homes have also been researched as smart homes become more popular. Since IoTDs generate sensitive data about the smart home environment, data security and privacy are key points for smart homes to continue getting popular. Blockchain is a technology that offers security and privacy naturally due to its decentralized aspects and the high level of interaction between the blockchain’s members and the manner that data is stored in hashed blocks. A smart contract is a computer code that runs inside the blockchain to provide authentication for the blockchain’s members. The combination of blockchain and smart contracts provides the management of smart devices in a manner that their data is handled securely and protected from unauthorized parties.

The errors caused by manual entry of vehicle registration information are absolutely eliminated. The process is made absolutely smooth and safe by the Smart Parking System. This not only stores reliable vehicle registration data in the database, but it also verifies the vehicle at exit points automatically. The Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system is a crucial component of smart cities as it uses image processing and optical character recognition (OCR) technology to read vehicle number plates. ANPR enables traffic control and law enforcement through an automated, fast, reliable, and robust vehicle plate recognition system. This paper proposes an enhanced OCR-based plate detection approach that utilizes YOLOv3 deep learning model and an object-based dataset trained by convolutional neural network (CNN) to detect alphanumeric data from the identified license plate. The project will produce a Dataframe containing vehicle’s registration details, entry time, exit time, and fees for the total duration of parking. To boost accuracy, a blended algorithm for license plate detection and recognition is proposed and compared to current methodologies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

For this reason, smart city systems can benefit from using Blockchain to integrate their data and services. These smart solutions also demand consistency and standardization across the industry.

FIWARE, a framework of an open-source platform for smart solutions, adopts NGSI Standards (Context Information Management (CIM); NGSI-LD API: Tech.

Unfortunately, FIWARE does not support any integration with Blockchain technology. Hence, this paper proposes a set of new components to allow FIWARE to be integrated with Blockchain technology. With these proposed components, it is possible to support Blockchain technology with smart city applications via the FIWARE platform. For instance, we have designed and implemented a FIWARE Blockchain adapter to submit/listen to transactions from/to FIWARE Context Broker to/from any Blockchain implementation without human intervention. In addition, we present a global post-pandemic vaccination case study to evaluate the proposed approach in the Smart City context. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

 abstract = {A citizen-centric view is key to channeling technological affordances into the development of future cities in which improvements are made with the quality of citizens’ life in mind. This paper proposes City 5.0 as a new citizen-centric design paradigm for future cities, in which cities can be seen as markets connecting service providers with citizens as consumers. City 5.0 is dedicated to eliminating restrictions that citizens face when utilizing city services. Our design paradigm focuses on smart consumption and extends the technology-centric concept of smart city with a stronger view on citizens’ roadblocks to service usage. Through a series of design workshops, we conceptualized the City 5.0 paradigm and formalized it in a semi-formal model. The applicability of the model is demonstrated using the case of a telemedical service offered by a Spanish public healthcare service provider. The usefulness of the model is validated by qualitative interviews with public organizations involved in the development of technology-based city solutions. Our contribution lies in the advancement of citizen-centric analysis and the development of city solutions for both academic and professional communities. © 2023, The Author(s).},

 abstract = {Localization techniques play a fundamental role in various applications like in the development of smart cities, making the improvement of such technologies indispensable. In this context, radio frequency (RF) fingerprinting (FP)-based localization methods are attractive due to their lower implementation cost, lower energy consumption, and better performance in non-line-of-sight conditions compared to GPS. With this in mind, we propose an RF FP-based localization method using an irregular grid map generation strategy. The grid map segmentation procedure is based on the assumption that the RF measurements collected in a region carry information on how users are often spatially distributed. The algorithms employed in the irregular grid map generation are the farthest-first traversal and low-discrepancy R-sequence. Different irregular grid map generators are compared with each other and with the regular grid map. We evaluate the generators in two different scenarios: with measurements obtained through simulation with ns-3 and via a driving-test procedure in an urban area. Numerical results indicate that our proposed irregular generator presents a lower localization error in both scenarios and is the only one capable of meeting one of the accuracy requirements stated by the Federal Communications Commission that demands a localization error of up to 50m in 80% of the emergency calls.},

This paper presents an anonymization quality framework for mix-zones enabling characterizing and evaluating the impacts of anonymization over time and space in mobility data. We conducted experiments with a cab mobility dataset and two positioning algorithms to explore one of the potentialities of the anonymization quality: elect mix-zones that do not consider the traffic but its operating requirements too. The results showed that the anonymization quality enabled the selection of mix-zones that yield data anonymization considering the quality, privacy, and utility analysis.

The presented CSOTL-VDCRS technique employs the mask-region based Convolutional Neural Network (Mask RCNN) technique for the detection of the vehicles. Once the vehicles in the RSIs are detected, the next step is to classify them using the Fuzzy Wavelet Neural Network (FWNN) model.

This topic has been discussed with greater emphasis in conjunction with environmental issues, driven by changes in the most diverse fields provided by the recent post-pandemic scenario. However, due to traditional or inefficient waste management approaches, most trash bins placed in cities can be seen as overflowing. Therefore, a remote monitoring system is needed to alert the level of garbage in bins to the relevant authority for waste clearance. In this scenario, the Internet of Things (IoT) paradigm plays a vital role in improving smart city applications by tracking and managing city processes.

 abstract = {CityZones is an online tool to support when computing risk zones in a city, which is performed by mathematically evaluating the emergency response capability of an urban area using real data. The tool allows users to define polygonal Areas of Interest (AoI) on a map, which are categorised into low, medium, and high-risk levels. As urban emergencies in general will typically demand the assistance of hospitals (to attend victims), firefighters (for rescue operations and damages reduction), policemen (to control and manage critical situations), and even metro stations (for evacuation), the risk zones within an AoI will be computed according to the distances to such existing infrastructure, which is extracted from the OpenStreetMap database. The coordinates of an AoI are defined at the client-side and submitted to a server as a regular or irregular polygon, which is then stored in a GeoJSON file along with the computed classifications for further processing according to a multi-tier pipeline. Adopting a configurable square-based mathematical model to compute distances and relative risk levels, the risk zones are computed on-demand and exported to CSV files to be used by any application, with an additional representation for web-based visualisation. Moreover, as a practical exploitation of the computed maps, the CityZones tool also suggests ideal positions for sensors-based Emergency Detection Units (EDUs) within an AoI according to the chosen positioning algorithm, assuming that the computed risk zones indicate how severe an undetected emergency would be. While the CityZones tool is not intended to provide a mitigation approach at all, since it does not have knowledge about current emergency situations, it stands as a valuable pre-mitigation tool to be used in the planning phase of emergency management in smart cities, bringing an important contribution for practical applications in this area. © 2023 The Author(s)},

 abstract = {Computer vision has always been a hot field of research by contemporary scholars due to its wide range of applications. As an important branch of this field, the visual monitoring technology has shown superior vitality in the actual monitoring environment of the Internet of Things (IoT). However, when the monitoring environment is complex, once the target monitoring fails, the important information related to the target also disappears. At this time, if the existing monitoring method is used, the target cannot be monitored again. Moreover, the current filtering monitoring algorithm also has the problem of poor interpretability. Therefore, this article combines the relevant characteristics of human inertial thinking when dealing with such problems. First, our method screens the movement information of the target and introduces a fuzzy reasoning mechanism to infer the location area of the target through fuzzy thinking. Then, an alternative selection strategy based on the thinking set is applied, which alternates between the location of thinking reasoning and the location of memory to further obtain the effective visual monitoring of the target. The filtering and monitoring algorithm fused with the new mechanism in the OTB-2015 data set, the UVA123 data set, and the TC128 data set all show that the proposed fuzzy inference mechanism has good robustness and universality. Furthermore, our results confirm that it can not only ensure the monitoring speed and overall accuracy but also improve the stability of monitoring in the IoT-assisted monitoring environment, showing its effectiveness compared to state-of-the-art methods. In addition, our results confirm that the integration of the proposed edge learning method with the IoT can be well applied to the construction of smart cities and future generation systems.  © 2022 IEEE.},

The Internet of Things (IoT)-based interconnected vision sensors in smart cities are considered essential elements of a CPS, and contribute significantly to urban security. However, the reidentification of targeted persons using emerging edge AI techniques still faces certain challenges. To improve efficiency at the edge and overcome the traditional sensing of video cameras, we employed an AI-based P-ReID framework for CPS that is functional in IoT environments. In addition, we present dual attention dilated network (DADNet), which integrates an energy-efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) with a self-attention module to substantially improve the person matching probability. Furthermore, we applied dual feature fusion to intelligently integrate discriminative and robust features using early and late fusion strategies that allow DADNet to significantly consider the foreground and marginally utilize the background information. Furthermore, we impose diversity orthogonality regularization over several CNN layers, which boosts the performance of DADNet, resulting in an appropriate usage over IoT networks. A comprehensive set of ablation studies, comparison with other state-of-the-art approaches, and a time complexity analysis confirm the strength of our DADNet for reidentification tasks in AI-enabled IoT settings that are well suited for a CPS.},

Such events commonly have a severe impact on major cities. Especially in Brazilian cities, the combination of climate change and unplanned urban growth on steep slopes has led to floods and landslides that killed thousands of people over the past decade. Once an extreme event impacts a city, a series of emergency events (henceforth named e-events) are registered by the citizens (by calling the local emergency telephone number). These e-events may vary from a small flood to a large-scale landslide. Thus, it is a top priority for governments to respond to these e-events as fast and as efficiently as possible. The problem is that the number of e-events is usually larger than the number of people (and vehicles) to respond to them. Another challenge is that these vehicles have to cross an impacted city with major traffic jams. The routes have to consider real-time traffic data to avoid streets with heavy traffic. This article proposes an approach named IRONSTONE, which aims at collecting the topology of the city and real-time traffic data to generate optimized routes for teams to respond to e-events. The proposed approach was evaluated with real scenarios of the city of Niteroi and the results are promising. © 2003-2012 IEEE.},

An important problem is the absence of technologies that certify the quality of information for the creation of strategies. In this context, expressive volumes of data are used, requiring great effort to understand their structures, and then access information with the desired quality. This study are designed to provide an initial response to the need for mapping zones in the city of Itajaí (SC), Brazil. The solution proposes to aid object recognition employing object-based classifiers OneR, NaiveBayes, J48, IBk, and Hoeffding Tree algorithms used together with GeoDMA, and a first approach in the use of Region-based Convolutional Neural Network (R-CNN) and the YOLO algorithm. All this is to characterize vegetation zones, exposed soil zones, asphalt, and buildings within an urban and rural area. Through the implemented model for active identification of geospatial objects with similarity levels, it was possible to apply the data crossover after detecting the best classifier with accuracy (85%) and the kappa agreement coefficient (76%). The case study presents the dynamics of urban and rural expansion, where expressive volumes of data are obtained and submitted to different methods of cataloging and preparation to subsidize rapid control actions. Finally, the research describes a practical and systematic approach, evaluating the extraction of information to the recommendation of knowledge with greater scientific relevance.

 abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is a key technology to interconnect the real and digital worlds, enabling the development of smart cities and services. The timely collection of data is essential for IoT services. In scenarios such as agriculture, industry, transportation, public safety, and health, wireless sensor networks (WSNs) play a fundamental role in fulfilling this task. However, WSNs are commonly deployed in sensitive and remote environments, thus facing the challenge of jamming attacks. Therefore, these networks need to have the ability to detect such attacks and adopt countermeasures to guarantee connectivity and operation. In this work, we propose a novel clustering-based self-healing strategy to overcome jamming attacks, in which we denominate fairness cooperation with power allocation (FCPA). The proposed strategy, aware of the presence of the jammer, clusters the network and designates a cluster head that acts as a sink node to collect information from its cluster. Then, the most convenient routes to overcome the jamming are identified and the transmit power is adjusted to the minimum value required to guarantee the reliability of each link. Finally, through the weighted use of the relays, the lifetime of each subnetwork is extended. To show the impact of each capability of FCPA, we compare it with multiple benchmarks that only partially possess these capabilities. In the proposal evaluation, we consider a WSN composed of 64 static nodes distributed in a square area. Meanwhile, to assess the impact of the jamming attack, we consider seven different locations of the attacker. All experiments started with each node’s battery full and stopped after one of these batteries was depleted. In these scenarios, FCPA outperforms all other strategies by more than (Formula presented.) of the information transmitted, due to the efficient use of relay power, through the weighted balance of cooperative routes. On average, FCPA permits 967,961 kb of information transmitted and (Formula presented.) of residual energy, as energy efficiency, from all the analyzed scenarios. Additionally, the proposed clustering-based self-healing strategy adapts to the change of jammer location, outperforming the rest of the strategies in terms of information transmitted and energy efficiency in all evaluated scenarios. © 2023 by the authors.},

In this sense, this research aims to develop a maturity model that ranks the “smartness” of a city based on social and technological indicators. The Smart Cities Maturity Model (MMSC) variables were extracted from ISO’s 37153:2017, 37120:2018, 37107:2019. The MMSC is structured on a hybrid TOPSIS multicriteria decision-making method. In this paper, we modified TOPSIS and used it to generate a synthetic indicator, called smart index, that designates the level of maturity of a real city. For this change to be possible, we fixed some alternatives and changed the positive ideal and negative ideal solution. The methodology is proven to be very efficient in measuring the smart city maturity level, and it can be easily adapted for the upcoming ISOs. © 2023 by the authors.},

Thus, this article describes the joint use of the SmartCitySysML, a profile proposed by the authors, with TCPN (Timed Coloured Petri Nets) to refine and formally model SysML diagrams specifying the internal behaviour, and then verify the developed model to prove behavioural properties of an urban traffic signal control system. © 2023, IICM.

 abstract = {Smart city platforms provide several services to facilitate the development of applications. Such platforms typically manage several applications, deal with a large volume of data, and serve many devices and users that generate a high volume of requests. The large number of requests to handle and the complex operations to perform often cause overloads on the platform, degrading the quality of service provided to users and applications. In this context, monitoring the underlying computational infrastructure in which smart city platforms and applications are deployed and the platform operations is essential. The monitoring process can allow for examining fluctuations in the behavior of the platform’s components to detect performance degradation and overloads (including unforeseen ones), contribute to avoiding interruptions in the platform’s services, and increase its scalability to assimilate significant amounts of requests, devices, and users. This paper presents a strategy and architecture to enable the nonintrusive monitoring of operations on smart city platforms and their underlying infrastructure. The proposal covers monitoring at multiple levels and is based on the aspect-oriented programming (AOP) paradigm so that it is possible to monitor the platform’s operations without intervening in the platform’s implementation or generating coupling regarding monitoring. This paper presents the implementation of the monitoring architecture and its instantiation in the context of Smart Geo Layers (SGeoL), a platform that has been used in several real-world smart city applications. This paper also reports the results of computational experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed monitoring architecture for response time to requests, CPU usage, and RAM utilization. The obtained results show an evident increase in response time with the number of simultaneous requests and a significant correlation between the response time and the CPU utilization in the deployment of the monitoring architecture. © 2023, Brazilian Computing Society.

Mainly because this new mobile technology offers massive connections in densely populated areas in smart cities, thus playing a crucial role for numerous subscribers anytime and anywhere. Indeed, all the most important infrastructure to promote a connected world is being related to next generation networks. Specifically, the small cells transmitters is one of the 5G technologies more relevant to provide more connections and to attend the high demand in smart cities. In this article, a smart small cell positioning is proposed in the context of a smart city. The work proposal aims to do this through the development of a hybrid clustering algorithm with meta-heuristic optimizations to serve users, with real data, of a region satisfying coverage criteria. Furthermore, the problem to be solved will be the best location of the small cells, with the minimization of attenuation between the base stations and its users. The possibilities of using multi-objective optimization algorithms based on bioinspired computing, such as Flower Pollination and Cuckoo Search, will be verified. It will also be analyzed by simulation which power values would allow the continuity of the service with emphasis on three 5G spectrums used around the world: 700 MHz, 2.3 GHz and 3.5 GHz. © 2023 Ferreira et al., All Rights Reserved},

The Concept of Smart Cities consider the Drone use for power line asset monitoring, homeland security, delivery of medicine and logistics, epidemiological control and environmental monitoring. Due the modular design of the aerial platform and the wireless charge station, the use of COTS equipment allows more flexibility in all processes and result in cost reduction as well as development process optimization, where the focus is on the system intearation. The wireless Drone charge station is a dedicated structure located at a strategic position within city limits, which is able to be used as communication relay, and to charge the Drones automatically via wireless, according the mission scope, increasing the Drone operation range over urban region. The sensors inside the wireless Drone charge station are loT devices for the collection of meteorological data, images, command / control Drones and data from the other Stations, through a dedicated Command and Control Situation Room. By utilizing a dedicated management software at the Situation room - called by SIGI software - the system can control the drone and the airspace, collect field data from sensors and process them in real time. The situational analysis makes it possible to the administrator to optimize resources (material and human) by improving the efficiency of resource allocation in these areas while providing the real time situational awareness. The Drone design is a quadcopter with Embedded Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision, defined as mission board, totally integrated with autopilot board and navigation sensors. A.I. and Computer vision are used to increase the Drone navigation precision, without a GPS-RTK/PPK device. In terms of mission requirements or customization, the Drone recognizes patterns and makes decisions according to each operational scope, e.g., visual identification of wireless charge stations, mosquito outbreaks, power lines assets in need of maintenance, swarm control for area saturation mapping and others. As described, this system focuses on a new concept of Smart Cities, the Drones as a Service Tool, to be employed in urban regions, helping the population in air mobility.},

 pages = {1--6}, 
 abstract = {Recently, many researchers have tried to answer a question regarding smart cities: how to connect a wide variety of sensors and aggregate the data collected by different technologies related to the Internet of Things (IoT)? Those data are usually gathered and transmitted through WAN (Wide Area Network) or private MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching) connections. However, since WAN based solutions present different resources in terms of data, size, coverage area, latency and capacity requirements, they become inefficient or even prohibitive regarding operating costs on smart city applications. An alternative is the use of SD-WAN (Software-Defined Wide Area Network), which combines hardware and software appliances or is software based only, consisting of the virtualization of WAN connections. The main characteristics of SD-WAN are: the ability to do dynamic path selection, facilitating data flow and increasing system resilience; the support to multiple connection types (ADSL, VDSL, FTTH, 3G/4G or 5G), enlarging the coverage area when compared with traditional WAN; the employment of a simple interface (easy to configure and manage); the capital and operation expenditure reduction; the increase of service agility and flexibility; the implementation of a centralized control and monitoring with lower costs. In this sense, this paper proposes an SD-WAN embedded white-label solution, of low cost and low energy consumption for commercial and academic use employing Ubuntu Linux, Floodlight SDN Controller, Open vSwitch and Raspberry Pi 3b. Then, the Quality of Service (QoS) parameters obtained by the proposed SD-WAN solution are measured and evaluated, through network emulation tests performed with the aid of Distributed Internet Traffic Generator (D-ITG), in order to verify the applicability in smart cities.  © 2023 IEEE.},

 pages = {1--15}, 
 abstract = {With the objective of reducing energy consumption in city environments, there is a need to replace outdated street lighting systems that still rely on the old high-pressure sodium technology for more efficient lighting devices. The inefficiency is caused by the lack of feedback regarding the status of the lamp, the power being drawn from the low-voltage distribution network, and the lack of control over the intensity. The progressive replacement of lighting devices offers a unique opportunity of using individual lighting controllers as access points in a larger smart city IoT backbone infrastructure. Smart metering solutions require a proper network infrastructure, which is normally too costly to deploy from scratch and could even cause a take-back effect, thus nullifying the benefits of energy monitoring. Previously proposed solutions for a smart city's network include using a mesh-type network based on Zigbee or point-to-point LoRAWAN-based solutions, which could not be entirely suitable for a noisy environment like a smart city. This research paper proposes an optimal IoT solution for smart cities that uses IEEE 802.15.4 6LoWPAN mesh networks with a suitable routing proto-col to achieve low latency and high energy efficiency. This solution is ideal for smart metering applications that require near-real-time data processing with a small to moderate data rate. This paper also proposes using an open-source modulation technique to reduce initial deployment costs and increase interoperability. The proposed solution provides a reliable, efficient, and cost-effective approach to modernizing street lighting systems in smart cities and a backbone infrastructure.},

When deploying an IDS in IoT-based smart city environments, the balance between latency and node capacity must be considered, which justifies a distributed IDS with specific classifiers based on the location of the system processing nodes. This paper proposes a two-level classification technique for collaborative anomaly-based IDSs deployed on fog and edge nodes. A Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) is used in the lower layer classifier at the edge, while a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used in the upper layer classifier at the fog. Experimentation has demonstrated that the suggested IDS architecture outperforms previous solutions. For instance, in some scenarios, when comparing our proposal with Random Forest, the former obtained an accuracy equal to 99.1%, while the latter obtained 95.3%. Furthermore, our proposal can better select the most important network traffic features, reducing 76% of the data to be analyzed and improving privacy.  © 2023 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Smart Cities currently utilize computational solutions to enhance the quality of life for their citizens. However, these systems can be complex to integrate as they are often isolated, heterogeneous, and maintained by distinct organizations at different activity levels. The System of System (SoS) concept is one way to promote interoperability. SoS is a collection of several isolated systems that act interoperably as part of a more extensive and intricate system, forming a cohesive and complex entity. Smart cities can benefit by using SoS to integrate services and develop new features. However, SoS has some limitations, such as increased costs, limited collaboration, and mistrust of shared data and functionalities. Blockchain technology can be used to establish a trusted decentralized controller entity through a consensus mechanism among network participants to overcome these challenges. Therefore, this paper presents an architecture that combines Blockchain with SoS theory to enable trusted interoperability among Smart Cities systems.

For that, we exploited the previous concepts of Area of Interest (AoI) and Points of Interest (PoI), extending them to also incorporate the concept of Area of Mitigation (AoM) for any regular or irregular polygonal AoI, considerably enhancing the definition of risk perceptions in a city. Additionally, we have proposed a new algorithm that finds realistic positions for Event Detection Units (EDUs) based on the streets in a city, avoiding prohibited deployment areas, which was in fact a deficiency of previous algorithms for this problem. By potentially reducing the time required to detect and notify emergency events in more critical urban areas, we want to improve the performance of emergency management systems as a whole, bringing important contributions for smart city applications in this area.  © 2023 IEEE.},

 abstract = {The adoption of multi-sensor hardware units to detect different types of emergencies in complex scenarios such as Industry 4.0 and Smart Cities is a recent development trend, which have demanded research efforts to optimize the way these units are assembled, configured, and deployed. However, although their expected advantages, usual multi-sensors emergency-oriented approaches may be constrained by the tight association between physical sensor devices and the emergency detection process. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative approach to concurrently detect multiple emergencies exploiting the concept of soft-sensor modules, which are implemented on Emergency Detection Units (EDUs) as concurrent tasks along with a high-priority emergency alerting task. The soft-sensor concept defines physical sensors as ordinary input data streams, which will be processed according to the defined algorithms by each particular soft-sensor, allowing detection decisions to be performed on the edge. In order to support the practical exploitation of this concept, a formal specification based on Petri Nets is defined, modeling the concurrent operation of the tasks within an EDU. A proof of concept is also designed based on the affordable Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller, demonstrating how the proposed approach would behave when two soft-sensors are implemented in a typical detection unit.  © 2023 IEEE.},

Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) promises to transform manufacturing through Digital Twins while Industry 4.0 advances digitalization with Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), machine learning, big data, and cloud computing. Hence, achieving Ultra-low latency (ULL) is crucial for applications like robotic control. Although 5G powered by Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) have improved the network capacity and reduced the ULL constraints, challenges persist due to wireless signal unpredictability. To address these issues, this research proposes leveraging in-network applications to the network edge to implement ULL solutions for industrial and Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) applications. Furthermore, we propose the hardware-based P7 emulation environment to evaluate data plane applications' performance, feasibility, effectiveness, and impact.  © 2023 IEEE.},

 abstract = {The rapid urbanization of cities has given rise to numerous challenges related to essential services and emergency management. To address these complexities, smart city solutions have emerged, employing advanced technologies to automate and enhance service quality. In this context, wireless sensor networks and the Internet of Things offer promising solutions for monitoring and detecting emergencies in urban environments. However, urban emergency detection is a complex task that requires intelligent data processing and analysis. Many existing approaches utilize artificial intelligence techniques to improve accuracy. Moreover, the time-critical nature of emergency detection necessitates swift and reliable diagnosis to avoid potential economic losses and human risks. To achieve precise and timely detection, a system capable of collecting georeferenced data, analyzing it, and providing reliable diagnoses is essential. In this paper, we propose a novel urban multiple emergency detection system based on hierarchical, collaborative and configurable wireless sensor networks. The hierarchical and collaborative nature of the proposed networks ensures efficient data exchange between sensing units of different categories. Our contributions lie in the implementation of flexible and configurable functionalities, enabling accurate and energy-efficient urban emergency detection adaptable to the unique characteristics of each city or region where it is deployed.  © 2023 IEEE.},

UAVs will densely populate aerial space in smart cities, providing networking and computing to interactive and monitoring services to ground users. FEC is composed of one or a set of UAVs, can cover large areas, and assure the quick deployment of services in 5G/6G systems. FEC will cooperate or even replace edge computing services on the ground network in case of congestion/failure events. However, the efficient selection and orchestration of UAVs to provide Quality of Service (QoS) to mobile users on the ground space is still challenging. This paper proposes a mobility-aware FEC orchestration scheme, called FLYED. FLYED enables UAVs to provide FEC with mobility and QoS support on ground space.

 abstract = {Context: A portion of the users in the São Paulo Metro are people who have physical limitations and need the help of wheelchairs or other similar devices. In this way, the Metro stations have elevators that allow these users to move between the floors of the station. In order, for the elevator to be used, it is necessary for the user to call the operators of the stations, who, in turn, check if the user who is requesting access to the elevator fits the target audience. Problem: This type of request requires manual validation by station operators, causing interruptions in their work routines and delays in passenger travel. Solution: To implement and evaluate artificial intelligence methods for automatic detection of people in wheelchairs or other auxiliary devices. IS Theory: This project was idealized from the perspective of Customer Focus Theory. Method: The You Only Look Once (YOLOv5) neural network was implemented in the Mobility Aids database. Tests were performed considering the original and modified base, composed of a reduced number of images, aiming to assess whether the accuracy of the model remains even with reduced database data. Summary of Results: The results obtained show an average accuracy of more than 92% with the modified database. Contribution: The results corroborated our methodology and we will be able to test in Sao Paulo subway with real images. In a long term, It is expected that by automating such a task, operators will be less overloaded and passengers with reduced mobility will gain more autonomy. © 2023 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

 pages = {245–251}, 
 abstract = {Context: Smart cities are the future in terms of good resource and people management practices. Several resources can be managed by smart cities, among them urban mobility and energy consumption stand out.Problem: The brightness of public roads consume energy resources, but they are not always necessary, as is the case with roads with no use. Thus, energy resources are wasted. This work aimed to explore the economy of energy resources by observing the flow of use of public roads.Solution: Sensors observe the roads, and the costs of the edges are sent to the fog that applies a graph algorithm to determine the paths that have movement and, thus, generate the reductions in energy consumption via switching off lamps or reducing their frequency.Information System Theory: Based on the General Systems Theory, the general system is mapped into independent systems: fog sensors (fog) and algorithm execution nodes (nodes with higher processing power). A general ecosystem is formulated making the information system based on the information generated by the observation of the sensors.Method: A simulated environment was proposed to obtain the representation of a region of interest. For this region, a graph approach based on Dijkstra was applied to consider the paths with the highest flow of accesses and, thus, propose energy consumption reductions.Results Summary: The results obtained point to a possibility of saving energy resources in the range of 60 to 79% depending on the type of lamps used, and the size of observed region. The results reinforce the need to explore intelligent resources for shared use resources management.Contributions and Impact in the IS area: Among the contributions to the area are: a manageable information system for public lighting. Use of fog for path management and energy matrix management. This work also contributes to proposing new approaches to the proposed problem, such as using the social context (via social networks) to define optimal paths.},

 abstract = {Context: With the growth of smart cities, surveillance camera systems have increased their monitoring capacity in different environments. In public Universities, monitoring requires subtle and precise alerts, in order to curb actions that may present a lack of security for the academic community. Problem: Although the detection objects in videos is possible, the high cost of acquiring, installing high-quality cameras and machines capable of executing high-precision models of customized solutions is expensive. In addition, most solutions achieve high precision in controlled environments, with high resolution still images, and focus on objects, which does not portray the reality of surveillance cameras in Universities. Solution: Faced with this problem, the objective is to build a Automatic License Plate Recognition system(ALPR) to control vehicles entering and leaving Universities. It is proposed to interoperate with camera systems in order to alert the competent authorities. Information systems theory: This work was conceived under the General Theory of Systems with regard to interoperate with already existing heterogeneous systems. Furthermore, as part of the theory of socio-technical systems, this approach aims to improve the performance of the organization, offering improvements in the productivity of the task due to the alerts of the offered approach. Method: This research is descriptive and its evaluation is done through proof of concept. Results: The artifact developed showed good performance, allowing to recognize license plates in surveillance cameras with 76.6% accuracy. Contributions and Impact in the area of information systems: Our main contribution is the artifact to detect vehicles. A secondary contribution is our dataset with Old and Mercosul Plaques versions.

 abstract = {The sustainability of cities and the links between the city and its citizens now depend substantially on the availability of digital mechanisms. In order to build the cities of the future we need to discuss ways in which the digital universe can best serve the new cities in terms of producing outcomes in the quality of the responses to citizens´ needs, in the city´s governance and in the transparency and security of public data. In particular, digital government has ushered in significant and enduring changes in the way people live and intend with each other, their environment, and public services. This article examines how digital technologies and innovations are impacting the public sector and changing people´s everyday lives (UN, 2018). A normative tool for smart city operating models is the application of the international standard ISO 37106:2021, which provides guidance to public, private and voluntary sector decision makers in smart cities and communities on how to develop an open, collaborative, citizen-centric and digitally-enabled operating model that coincides with their vision fora future sustainable city (ISO, 2021). The article examines the guidelines and contributions of this ISO 37106:2021 for smart cities, focusing especially on the different ways in which it has impacted Electronic (or Digital) Government in Brazil´s three spheres of government: Federation, State and Municipal (the latter represented here by the municipality of Santo André in the state of São Paulo). As an analysis of city improvements that foreshadow a more sustainable future, this article considers urban sustainability in terms of social, economic, environmental and governance sustain-ability. The city that seeks continuous improvement should ensure environmental and economic sustainability, together with social sustainability, which basically entails ensuring its citizens´ right to thecity. especially through the implementation of social policies. Standardization institutions play an important role in the design of metric standards to measure sustainability-related performance (Negreiros, 2019). The article is based upon: (1) a literature review in the areas of digital government and standardization (2) research and analysis of current legislation in Brazil on the subject; and (3) semi-structured interviews with public sector practitioners from the federal, state and municipal levels.},

 abstract = {When designing smart cities' building blocks, mobility data plays a fundamental role in applications and services. However, mobility data usually comes with unrestricted location of its corresponding entities (e.g., citizens and vehicles) and poses privacy concerns, among them recovering the identity of those entities with linking attacks. To address the privacy of users' identity, Location Privacy Protection Mechanisms (LPPMs) based on anonymization have been proposed, such as mix-zones. Once the data is protected, a comprehensive discussion about the trade-off between privacy and utility happens. However, issues still arise about the application of anonymized data to smart city development: what are the smart cities applications and services that can best leverage mobility data anonymized by mix-zones? To answer this question, we present a methodology that evaluates the utility in many aspects with metrics related to privacy, mobility, and anonymized trajectories produced by mix-zones. The results showed that the proposed methodology identifies application domains of smart cities in which anonymized data can have more or less utility. Additionally, different datasets present different behaviors in terms of utility. These insights can contribute significantly to the utility of both open and private data markets for smart cities.  © 2023 ACM.},

It can be said that smart university campuses are a subdomain of the smart cities domain, with some similar problems, but with specificities. Recommender systems identify and suggest relevant information to the user, recognizing their potential interests through specialized algorithms and presenting resources that align with these interests. In the context of intelligent university campuses, recommender systems have been used to define which systems and technologies should be implemented. From this scenario, the objective of this article is to present a software architecture, called SmartC, structured in different services, to provide the essential infrastructure for the application of several recommender systems and a variety of types of items. The services and layers of the architecture were defined especially for intelligent university campuses and divided into three distinct sections: the access environment, the recommendations management environment and the persistence layer. The recommendation algorithms integrated to this architecture are considered hybrids, since they incorporate two types of filtering: content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. When users request new recommendations, the type of filtering will be switched, ensuring that new features are suggested with each system call and avoiding throttling. The developed prototype was evaluated from real item data and showed significant accuracy in the recommendation process. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

 abstract = {Effective quality management plays a pivotal role in ensuring the smooth operation of smart city systems, which have significant implications for safety, accessibility, affordability, and maintainability. Dependability of autonomous systems is of utmost importance, as achieving satisfactory levels of availability and reliability poses considerable challenges. Smart cities are characterized by interconnected sub-architectures, encompassing vehicle monitoring, sidewalk monitoring, and building monitoring, all of which need to function efficiently. Analytical models such as Petri nets, Markov chains, and fault trees are well-suited for evaluating complex scenarios in the context of smart cities. This paper presents analytical models that utilize fault tree and Markov chain techniques to assess the availability and reliability of smart city monitoring systems. The model is divided into shared and non-shared components, with non-shared components being specific to certain contextual applications, while shared components, such as data processing and electrical power, are essential for all smart city monitoring and management systems. The study underscores the ease with which the fault tree model can enhance availability by modifying failure requirements and resources. Case studies provide concrete examples of how availability improved from 95.3 to 99.8% by varying a configuration known as "KooN" in multiple components. This paper takes a comprehensive approach to evaluating the dependability of smart city architectures and contributes advancements, such as hierarchical modeling, sequential sensitivity analysis, and the "KooN" analytic method. These contributions expand the existing knowledge and methodologies in smart city dependability analysis.

 abstract = {The transformation of cities into smarter and more efficient environments relies on proactive and timely detection and maintenance of city-wide infrastructure, including roadside infrastructure such as road signs and the cleaning of illegally dumped rubbish. Currently, these maintenance tasks rely predominantly on citizen reports or on-site checks by council staff. However, this approach has been shown to be time-consuming and highly costly, resulting in significant delays that negatively impact communities. This paper presents AIoT-CitySense, an AI and IoT-driven city-scale sensing framework, developed and piloted in collaboration with a local government in Australia. AIoT-CitySense has been designed to address the unique requirements of roadside infrastructure maintenance within the local government municipality. A tailored solution of AIoT-CitySense has been deployed on existing waste service trucks that cover a road network of approximately 100 kms in the municipality. Our analysis shows that proactive detection for roadside infrastructure maintenance using our solution reached an impressive 85%, surpassing the timeframes associated with manual reporting processes. AIoT-CitySense can potentially transform various domains, such as efficient detection of potholes and precise line marking for pedestrians. This paper exemplifies the power of leveraging city-wide data using AI and IoT technologies to drive tangible changes and improve the quality of city life. © The Author(s) 2023.},

 abstract = {When designing smart cities’ building blocks, mobility data plays a fundamental role in applications and services. However, mobility data usually comes with unrestricted location of its corresponding entities (e.g., citizens and vehicles) and poses privacy concerns, among them recovering the identity of those entities with linking attacks. Location Privacy Protection Mechanisms (LPPMs) based on anonymization, such as mix-zones, have been proposed to address the privacy of users’ identity. Once the data is protected, a comprehensive discussion about the trade-off between privacy and utility happens. However, issues still arise about the application of anonymized data to smart city development: what are the smart cities applications and services that can best leverage mobility data anonymized by mix-zones? To answer this question, we propose the Utility Analysis Framework of Anonymized Trajectories for Smart Cities-Application Domains (UAFAT). This characterization framework measures the utility through twelve metrics related to privacy, mobility, and social, including mix-zones performance metrics from anonymized trajectories produced by mix-zones. This framework aims to identify applications and services where the anonymized data will provide more or less utility in various aspects. The results evaluated with cabs and privacy cars datasets showed that further characterizing it by distortion level, UAFAT ranked the smart cities application domains that best leverage mobility data anonymized by mix-zones. Also, it identified which one of the four case studies of smart city applications had more utility. Additionally, different datasets present different behaviors in terms of utility. These insights can contribute significantly to the utility of both open and private data markets for smart cities. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

 abstract = {The detection of critical situations through the adoption of multi-sensor Emergency Detection Units (EDUs) can significantly reduce the time between the initial stages of urban emergencies and the actual responses to relieve its negative effects, usually through the rescuing of endangered people, the attending to eventual victims, and the mitigating of its causes. However, although the benefits of such units are well known, their proper positioning in a city is challenging when considering a limited set of available units. In this sense, data-driven approaches can be leveraged to provide a better perception of the urban environments under consideration, allowing emergency management systems to be tailored to the specificities of a target city, thus improving the positioning of EDUs. This article proposes the processing of geospatial data of emergency-related urban infrastructure to support the computing of risk zones in a city, which is retrieved from the OpenStreetMap database together with the map of streets within a defined area. Since risk zones indirectly indicate the proportional number of detection units to be deployed, for each configuration setting of the EDUs, we propose an algorithm that computes the positions for such units only on streets, in a balanced way. Furthermore, considering that EDUs are expected to report detected emergencies through a wireless connection, we have also modelled the coverage area of existing networks in a city, which is also processed according to a suitable dataset. The proposed algorithm performs a fine-grained positioning of EDUs based on the number of active networks, flexibly favouring the EDUs' connectivity requirements such as reliability, throughput, latency, and transmission costs according to the actual demands of any urban emergency management system. Experimental results with real data demonstrated the applicability of the proposed mathematical model and the associated algorithm, reinforcing its practical application for the planning and construction of smart cities.},

 abstract = {Urban forests provide many benefits for municipalities and their residents, including air quality improvement, urban atmosphere cooling, and pluvial flooding reduction. Monitoring the trees is one of the tasks among the several urban forest assessment procedures. Trees with a risk of falling may threaten the locals and the infrastructure of the cities, thereby being an immediate concern for forestry managers. In general, a set of measures and aspects are collected from field survey analysis to estimate whether the trees represent a risk to the safety of the urban spaces. However, gathering the tree's physical measures in fieldwork campaigns is time-consuming and laborious considering the massive number of trees in the cities. Therefore, there is an urge for new computational-based methodologies, especially those related to the latest advances in artificial intelligence, to accelerate the assessment of trees in the municipality areas. In this sense, this work aims at using several machine learning-based methods in the context of tree condition inspection. Particularly, we present the prediction of the tree failure probability by using several aspects collected over time from fieldwork campaigns, with a special focus on external physical measures of the trees. Further, we provide the samples with their respective tree failure probability values as a new open dataset for further investigations on tree status monitoring. We also present a novel dataset composed of images of trees with bounding boxes delineations of the tree, trunk, and crown for automating the tree monitoring tasks. Regarding the tree failure probability estimation, we compared several regression algorithms for estimating the tree failure likelihood. Moreover, we propose a stacking generalization approach to enhance forecast accuracy and minimize prediction errors. The results showed the viability of the proposed method as an auxiliary tool in tree analysis tasks, which attained the lowest average Mean Absolute Error of 5.6901±1.1709 yielded by the stacking generalization model.},

 abstract = {Smart cities and healthcare services have been gaining much attention in recent years, as the benefits offered by this field of research are significant and improve quality of life. Systems can proactively detect health problems by monitoring a person’s vital signs and make automated decisions to prevent these problems from worsening. With this in mind, we highlight two essential requirements that smart city architectures should consider to achieve elevated quality of experience in the healthcare domain. The first is to process high-priority vital signs with short response times, so people with comorbidities can have health problems identified as soon as possible. The second is to employ scalability techniques to deal with high usage peaks resulting from people concentrating in specific city neighborhoods. This paper contributes to this field of research by proposing SmartVSO - a computational model of a hierarchic, scalable, tree-based, fog-cloud architecture that executes healthcare services with reduced response time for urgent vital signs. Fog computing is employed to reduce response times, and cloud computing is used to provide virtually infinite computing resources. Serverless computing is the main technology we consider for deploying and running healthcare services because this allows authorized companies to implement their own services in a distributed and pluggable approach, without recompiling the proposed modules and reducing scalability concerns for engineers. An experiment with 80,000 vital signs indicates that our solution processes 60% of the very critical ones in no more than 5.3 s, while an architecture without fog computing and without prioritization takes up to 231 min (around 3 h and 51 min) to process 60% of very critical vital signs.},

 abstract = {Ubiquitous sensing in smart cities is expected to be one of the key beneficiaries of the high bandwidth and low latency capabilities of 5G. However, current 5G deployments still have low population coverage, and are unlikely to reach global coverage of above 80% before 2028. This means that new smart city applications are likely to experience a combination of 4G and 5G, limiting their data-intensive capabilities. Thus, it is necessary to assess the ability of current 5G deployments to support emerging smart city applications, and how they perform in 5G environments. Existing performance evaluations focus either on the 5G core or use instantaneous speed tests, which do not effectively assess the suitability of 5G deployments for smart city applications. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation and analysis of real-world 5G network performance observed through the outcomes of a pilot smart city application, an innovative mobile 5G Internet of Things (IoT) solution to automatically identify and report road assets requiring maintenance. The pilot smart city application was deployed on 11 waste collection service trucks over a 6 month period (June 2022–Dec 2022). We undertook both application-specific and application independent network performance evaluation to assess the ability of the 5G deployment to support uninterrupted smart city services. Our analysis shows that while 5G is capable of supporting mobile video streaming applications, there are significant variations in network performance, which may make it unsuitable for applications that require higher data intensive or near real-time responsiveness. © 2024 The Author(s)},

After running performance tests on the different configurations, the container orchestrator usage led to enhanced distributed processing, lowering the latency, increasing flexibility, enhancing security, and providing cost-effectiveness and scalability. We introduce the implementation of a modern DSA, developed following state-of-the-art cloud patterns and compliant with the RM for the SB context. Furthermore, we have ensured the reproducibility of this implementation by making the initial tests and overall architecture code available in public repositories. The research follows the Design Science Research (DSR) methodology for elaborating each phase until we get the artifact (DSA) and, with this, contribute to the Knowledge Base.

The concept of a smart campus is derived from the concept of a smart city, which was developed to demonstrate how urban areas were addressing their new and dynamic challenges by integrating technology and data-driven decision-making. Although the concept of the smart campus was initially conceived to study the smart city in a less complex setting, over time, both concepts have evolved into distinct areas of inquiry, exhibiting unique characteristics and impacts. In general, a smart campus is a university campus where information and communication technologies and IoT are applied to some or all the campus processes, thereby making these processes more efficient, cost-effective and environmentally sustainable for the institution, its members and the surrounding community. Additionally to presenting the proposal for a flexible and comprehensive architecture for a smart campus, this paper also demonstrates its interpretation for implementation on a Brazilian campus transitioning to become smart, the Institute of Science and Technology, Sorocaba (ICTS) - campus of the São Paulo State University (Unesp) in Sorocaba, Brazil. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there is a scarcity of existing works which address this level of detail when proposing an IoT architecture for a smart campus. The implementation of this architecture has demonstrated that it can be successfully deployed using only open-source technologies. Furthermore, it has been shown that anyone with access to the campus website can access most of the data collected and stored on the system.},

 abstract = {As delivery companies continue to explore the use of drones, the need for efficient and safe operation in urban environments becomes increasingly critical. Market-wide versions of drone delivery services will necessarily spread many drones, especially in big cities. In this scenario, avoiding collisions with other drones or typical obstacles in urban spaces is fundamental. This paper proposes and evaluates, via simulation and analytical modeling, an aerial delivery service scenario and three autonomous geometric approaches for collision avoidance. We compare our approaches with three simple methods-DoNothing (not detouring), Random, and aviation-like Rightward-and two state-of-The-Art geometric approaches. Simulation experiments consider different fleet sizes with constant and Poisson drone arrival rates and drones randomly choosing one of different altitudes for the cruise flight. Contrary to our expectations, the Random and Rightward approaches increase the collisions compared with DoNothing, making the latter our baseline. Our approaches significantly reduce collisions in all experiments and deal with more drones within the detection radius, showing that collisions are more complex to avoid. Comparing the collision rate, successful trips, and the number of flying drones reveals that the efficiency in avoiding collisions reduces the number of successful trips by increasing the number of active drones. Regardless of the expected reduction in collisions, more altitudes do not eliminate them. These results indicate the need for more sophisticated approaches to reduce or eliminate collisions. The analytical modeling using Markov Chains corroborates the simulation results by shedding some light on and helping explain the simulation results.  © 2000-2011 IEEE.},

Intelligent diagnostic tools through automatic detection in medical images are extremely effective in aiding medical diagnosis. Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) systems are of utmost importance for image-based pre-diagnosis, and the use of artificial intelligence–based tools for monitoring, detection, and segmentation of the pathological region are increasingly used in integrated smart solutions within smart city systems through cloud data processing with the use of edge computing. This study proposes a new approach capable of integrating into computational monitoring and medical diagnostic assistance systems called Health of Things Melanoma Detection System (HTMDS). The method presents a deep learning–based approach using the YOLOv8 network for melanoma detection in dermatoscopic images. The study proposes a workflow through communication between the mobile device, which extracts captured images from the dermatoscopic device and uploads them to the cloud API, and a new approach using deep learning and different fine-tuning models for melanoma detection and segmentation of the region of interest, along with the cloud communication structure and comparison with methods found in the state of the art, addressing local processing. The new approach achieved satisfactory results with over 98% accuracy for detection and over 99% accuracy for skin cancer segmentation, surpassing various state-of-the-art works in different methods, such as manual, semi-automatic, and automatic approaches. The new approach demonstrates effective results in the performance of different intelligent automatic models with real-time processing, which can be used in affiliated institutions or offices in smart cities for population use and medical diagnosis purposes.

 abstract = {Smart cities can improve the quality of life of citizens by optimizing the utilization of resources. In an IoT-connected environment, people’s health can be constantly monitored, which can help identify medical problems before they become serious. However, overcrowded hospitals can lead to long waiting times for patients to receive treatment. The literature presents alternatives to address this problem by adjusting care capacity to demand. However, there is still a need for a solution that can adjust human resources in multiple healthcare settings, which is the reality of cities. This work introduces HealCity, a smart-city-focused model that can monitor patients’ use of healthcare settings and adapt the allocation of health professionals to meet their needs. HealCity uses vital signs (IoT) data in prediction techniques to anticipate when the demand for a given environment will exceed its capacity and suggests actions to allocate health professionals accordingly. Additionally, we introduce the concept of multilevel proactive human resources elasticity in smart cities, thus managing human resources at different levels of a smart city. An algorithm is also devised to automatically manage and identify the appropriate hospital for a possible future patient. Furthermore, some IoT deployment considerations are presented based on a hardware implementation for the proposed model. HealCity was evaluated with four hospital settings and obtained promising results: Compared to hospitals with rigid professional allocations, it reduced waiting time for care by up to 87.62%. © 2024 by the authors.},

 abstract = {The accelerated development of technologies within the Internet of Things landscape has led to an exponential boost in the volume of heterogeneous data generated by interconnected sensors, particularly in scenarios with multiple data sources as in smart cities. Transferring, processing, and storing a vast amount of sensed data poses significant challenges for Internet of Things systems. In this sense, data reduction techniques based on artificial intelligence have emerged as promising solutions to address these challenges, alleviating the burden on the required storage, bandwidth, and computational resources. This article proposes a framework that exploits the concept of data reduction to decrease the amount of heterogeneous data in certain applications. A machine learning model that predicts a distortion rate and its corresponding reduction rate of the imputed data is also proposed, which uses the predicted values to select, among many reduction techniques, the most suitable approach. To support such a decision, the model also considers the context of the data producer that dictates the class of reduction algorithm that is allowed to be applied to the input stream. The achieved results indicate that the Huffman algorithm performed better considering the reduction of time-series data, with significant potential applications for smart city scenarios. © 2024 by the authors.},

 abstract = {The Wi-SUN FAN (Wireless Smart Ubiquitous Network Field Area Network) standard is attracting great interest in various applications such as smart meters, smart cities and Internet of Things (IoT) devices due to the attractive features that the standard offers, such as multihop and mesh topologies, a relatively high data rate, frequency hopping, and interoperability between manufacturers. However, the process of connecting nodes in Wi-SUN FAN networks, which includes discovering, joining, and forming the network, has been shown to be slow, especially in multihop environments, which has motivated research and experimentation to analyze this process. In the existing literature, to measure network formation time, some authors have performed experiments with up to 100 devices, which is a costly and time-consuming methodology. Others have used simulation tools that are difficult to replicate, because little information is available about the methodology used or because they are proprietary. Despite these efforts, there is still a lack of information to adequately assess the formation time of Wi-SUN FAN networks, since the experimental tests reported in the literature are expensive and time-consuming. Therefore, alternatives such as computer simulation have been explored to speed up performance analysis in different scenarios. With this perspective, this paper is focused on the implementation of the Wi-SUN FAN network formation process using the Contiki-NG open source operating system and the Cooja simultor, where a functionality was added that makes it possible to efficiently analyze the network performance, thereby facilitating the implementation of new techniques to reduce network training time. The simulation tool was integrated into Contiki-NG and has been used to estimate the network formation times in various indoor environments. The correspondence between the experimental and numerical results obtained shows that our proposal is efficient to study the formation process of this type of networks. © 2024 by the authors.},

 abstract = {In a LoRaWAN network, the backend is generally distributed as Software as a Service (SaaS) based on container technology, and recently, a containerized version of the LoRaWAN node stack is also available. Exploiting the disaggregation of LoRaWAN components, this paper focuses on the emulation of complex end-to-end architecture and infrastructures for smart city scenarios, leveraging on lightweight virtualization technology. The fundamental metrics to gain insights and evaluate the scaling complexity of the emulated scenario are defined. Then, the methodology is applied to use cases taken from a real LoRaWAN application in a smart city with hundreds of nodes. As a result, the proposed approach based on containers allows for the following: (i) deployments of functionalities on diverse distributed hosts; (ii) the use of the very same SW running on real nodes; (iii) the simple configuration and management of the emulation process; (iv) affordable costs. Both premise and cloud servers are considered as emulation platforms to evaluate the resource request and emulation cost of the proposed approach. For instance, emulating one hour of an entire LoRaWAN network with hundreds of nodes requires very affordable hardware that, if realized with a cloud-based computing platform, may cost less than USD 1. © 2024 by the authors.},

 abstract = {Current technologies could potentially solve many of the urban problems in today’s cities. Many cities already possess cameras, drones, thermometers, pollution air gauges, and other sensors. However, most of these have been designated for use in individual domains within City Hall, creating a maze of individual data domains that cannot connect to each other. This jumble of domains and stakeholders prevents collaboration and transparency. Cities need an integrated system in which data and dashboards can be shared by city administrators to better deal with urban problems that involve several sectors and to improve oversight. This paper presents a model of an integrative system to manage classes of problems within one administrative municipal domain. Our model contains the cyber-physical system’s elements: the physical object, the sensors and electronic devices attached to it, a database of collected problems, code running on the devices or remotely, and the human. We tested the model by using it on the recurring problem of potholes in city streets. An AI model for identifying potholes was integrated into applications available to citizens and operators so that they can feed the municipal system with images and the locations of potholes using their cell phone camera. Preliminary results indicate that these sensors can detect potholes with an accuracy of 91% and 99%, depending on the detection equipment used. In addition, the dashboards provide the manager and the citizen with a transparent view of the problems’ progress and support for their correct address. © 2024 by the authors.},

Practical mechanisms for assessing flood risk have become highly desired, but existing solutions have been devoted to evaluating only specific cities and consider only limited risk perspectives, constraining their general applicability. This article presents an innovative approach for assessing the flood risk of delimited urban areas by exploiting geospatial information from publicly available databases, providing a method that is applicable to any city in the world and requiring minimum configurations. A set of mathematical equations is defined for numerically assessing risk levels based on elevation, slope, and proximity to rivers, while the existence of emergency-related urban infrastructure is considered as a risk reduction factor. Then, computed risk levels are used to classify areas, allowing easy visualisation of flood risk for a city. This smart city approach not only serves as a valuable tool for assessing the expected flood risk based on different parameters but also facilitates the implementation of cutting-edge strategies to effectively mitigate critical situations, ultimately enhancing urban resilience to flood-related disaster. © 2024 by the authors.},

The transportation sector plays a pivotal role in this issue, being a major contributor to CO (Formula presented.) emissions. In light of this situation, this article proposes a methodology that utilizes a supervised learning algorithm to estimate CO (Formula presented.) emissions and compare vehicles fueled with ethanol and gasoline. Additionally, the solution adopts an online, unsupervised machine learning algorithm to identify data outliers and improve the confidence in the results. Furthermore, this work incorporates the concept of digital twins, using virtual models of vehicles to carry out more extensive pollution simulations and allowing the simulation of various types of vehicles and the modeling of realistic traffic scenarios. A supervised machine learning approach was adopted to infer emission data in the model, allowing more comprehensive and meaningful comparisons between real-world and simulated measurements. The performed analyses of pollution emissions for different speeds and sections of routes demonstrate that CO (Formula presented.) emissions from ethanol were significantly lower than those from gasoline, favoring more sustainable fuels even in combustion engine vehicles. Adopting cleaner fuels is perceived as crucial to mitigate the negative effects of climate change, with plant-based fuels like ethanol being crucial during the transition from fossil fuels to a more sustainable vehicular landscape. © 2024 by the authors.},

The digitalization of cities, with its layers of digital governance, alone is insufficient to cover gaps in basic information for populations. With the participants’ insights, it was possible to design and develop a software application (app) under strict requirements with anonymization and geolocations of human rights violations. The tests also highlighted limitations and future improvements.

 abstract = {This study aims to propose an approach for spatiotemporal integration of bus transit, which enables users to change bus lines by paying a single fare. This could increase bus transit efficiency and, consequently, help to make this mode of transit more attractive. Usually, this strategy is allowed for a few hours in a non-restricted area; thus, certain walking distance areas behave like “virtual terminals.” For that, two data-driven algorithms are proposed in this work. First, a new algorithm for detecting itineraries based on bus GPS data and the bus stop location. The proposed algorithm’s results show that 90% of the database detected valid itineraries by excluding invalid markings and adding times at missing bus stops through temporal interpolation. Second, this study proposes a bus stop clustering algorithm to define suitable areas for these virtual terminals where it would be possible to make bus transfers outside the physical terminals. Using real-world origin-destination trips, the bus network, including clusters, can reduce traveled distances by up to 50%, making twice as many connections on average. © 2024, J. Internet Serv.

 abstract = {In smart cities, it is common practice to define a maximum length of stay for a given parking space to increase the space's rotativity and discourage the usage of individual transportation solutions. However, automatically determining individual car dwell times from images faces challenges, such as images collected from low-resolution cameras, lighting variations, and weather effects. In this work, we propose a method that combines two deep neural networks to compute the dwell time of each car in a parking lot. The proposed method first defines the parking space status between occupied and empty using a deep classification network. Then, it uses a Siamese network to check if the parked car is the same as the previous image. Using an experimental protocol that focuses on a cross-dataset scenario, we show that if a perfect classifier is used, the proposed system generates 75% of perfect dwell time predictions, where the predicted value matched exactly the time the car stayed parked. Nevertheless, our experiments show a drop in prediction quality when a real-world classifier is used to predict the parking space statuses, reaching 49% of perfect predictions, showing that the proposed Siamese network is promising but impacted by the quality of the classifier used at the beginning of the pipeline.  © 2024 IEEE.},

 abstract = {This article discusses the main problems of traditional cemeteries in urban centers, including the lack of space due to population growth, environmental contamination from the use of toxic products in burials, public health issues arising from poor management and maintenance, and cultural and religious issues that make the grieving experience more challenging. The goal is to propose a new cemetery model integrated into urban planning that minimizes environmental impacts and offers a more humane experience for families and visitors, contributing to the sustainable development of cities. Additionally, this work highlights the importance of interdisciplinary research and partnerships between government, the private sector, and academia to develop this new cemetery paradigm. The method used was an integrative review on the subject. The article first addresses the current problems of traditional cemeteries; then, it introduces concepts of smart and sustainable cities that can be applied to cemeteries; and finally, it suggests the implementation of a new model for cemeteries, including the addition of green spaces, efficient use of water resources and solar energy, artificial intelligence-based monitoring systems, as well as virtual memorials and other innovations. Certainly, this innovative model has the potential to create a more humane and sustainable environment for urban cemeteries by integrating smart technologies and meeting the cultural and emotional needs of communities.  © 2024 IEEE.},

 abstract = {Several countries have implemented automatic meter readings to bill basic services. It requires smart meters and the deployment of communication networks (wired or wireless). Several companies offering basic services still use analog meters. Regarding smart meter implementation in Peru, we find that only electricity companies are currently in the trial stage. And the most advanced implementation is using Power Line Communication (Wired Network). The water service is in the project stage and the gas service does not present information. We propose a module that takes a picture of the meter's counter, packages the data, and sends it over a LoRa Network to a Gateway. We implement a LoRa multi-packet protocol prototype for image transmission. The Multi-Packet protocol assigns bytes from the LoRa sub-packet to be the header of the packet, this header gives information to improve efficiency. Sending packets in batches improves energy consumption and time transmission because the sender does not have to wait for an ACK response. This work is the first step in a surveillance system, and gives information about image transmission using LoRa. © 2024 IEEE.},

 abstract = {The prevalence of fires in modern urban landscapes continues to be reported as a significant challenge due to their potential negative consequences. This enduring threat heightened by climate changes necessitates the development of innovative approaches for early detection, incorporating a variety of sensor-based technologies across diverse scopes. Although effective, traditional detection methods based on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or camera sensors often encounter cost, scalability, and deployment limitations, particularly for vast areas to be covered. On the other hand, scalar sensors for threshold-based fire detection are limited to the context and require proper calibration for different scenarios. This paper addresses these limitations by introducing a novel approach that leverages a sensor-based decision tree model for fire and smoke detection using micro Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The core of this approach lies in developing an efficient, lightweight model suited for extreme edge devices, where performance and energy efficiency are critical. We validated our model using a public dataset, demonstrating its potential effectiveness in real-world scenarios. By providing a sensor-based solution that is both scalable and cost-effective, the proposed solution emerges as a promising tool for augmenting fire safety measures in urban and wildland areas.  © 2024 IEEE.},

As the global population increases and moves to urban areas, there is a growing need for utilities such as water, electricity, gas, and others. The current Smart City concept is strongly tied to Information and Communication Technology (ICT) towards improving sustainability and ensuring efficient usage of scarce resources in the urban area. This paper intends to evaluate Graph Neural Networks (GNN), a class of graph-based Deep Learning algorithms, to detect and locate water leakage under the data availability restrictions of Low Power Wide-Area Networks (LPWAN), a popular class of wireless sensor networks in IoT/Smart Cities applications. A case study Water Distribution Network (WDN) was developed to obtain data for training and validation. Also, linear regression was employed to minimize the number of sensor nodes, aiming to reduce implementation costs. The results indicate that the graph-based approach tied with linear regression in intermediate nodes can provide up to 80% accuracy, even under the data restrictions of LPWAN. Also, the usage of linear regression improved the mean accuracy of the GNN algorithm by approximately 18% in all three simulated cases in comparison to the situation without data from intermediate (junction) nodes, even with 37% fewer sensor nodes available.  © 2024 IEEE.},

The emergence of Smart Grid (SG) architecture connects Smart Meters (SM) to the Electric Power Company (EPC) using various communication technologies like Power Line Communication (PLC) and wireless networks such as 5G, LoRa, and others. However, the vast amount of data generated by this infrastructure can lead to network overload and storage and processing challenges. To address this, this paper proposes implementing a Big Data Analytics framework under the Hybrid Demand Side Management as a Service (HyDSMaaS) architecture in the Multi Microgrid scenario. This approach divides the SG into Microgrids, creating smaller groups of nodes and transforming the centralized infrastructure into a scalable and decentralized one. Additionally, a monitoring system using Grafana was implemented to manage server usage flow and monitor access and services.

 abstract = {Ensuring data privacy and integrity is imperative in wireless connection. Sensitive information needs to be transmitted through long-distance areas in many scenarios as healthcare, agricultural production and smart cities. Not only security, but also performance in this particular type of communication is not a trivial match. The LoRaWAN protocol is capable of transmitting data between IoT as end devices to application servers where the data can be analyzed and stored. The protocol offers a significant security standard and a recognized performance in long-range communication at low cost. However, the advances in Quantum Computing also bring threats to the current state of cryptographic algorithms, possibly compromising communication privacy. LoRaWAN’s security is based on AES-128 cryptographic algorithm, which is not safe to quantum computers. Thus, this work proposes an enhancement in LoraWAN’s security protocol adding the Kyber KEM-1024 algorithm to reinforce the protocol against quantum-computing attacks. The implementation successfully simulated the communication between an end device and an application server performing the post-quantum algorithm KEM-1024. Despite the results for time of execution can be improved, the proposal presented a safe communication resistant to quantum-computing attacks.},

Two main components of the smart grid architecture are the communication networks for Distribution Automation (DA) and Advanced Metering Infrastructure (AMI), responsible for communicating with the smart meters installed at the user's premises. This work focuses on planning the wireless backhaul network that supports communication networks for DA and AMI. Backhaul networking involves deploying wireless communication devices to establish wireless links for interconnecting routers, gateways, and automation equipment. Planning these wireless links can be quite challenging due to the geographical diversity of deployment environments, inaccuracies in propagation models in heterogeneous areas (rural, suburban, and urban), and the necessity for detailed databases of soil relief and coverage, which are generally paid and high cost. This paper introduces a satellite imagery-assisted algorithm designed to facilitate efficient link budget analysis for wireless links in smart grid backhaul network planning. The satellite-assisted method classifies the terrain and makes it possible to aggregate loss information from various types of obstructions, such as trees, buildings, and the elevation of the terrain itself. The method uses information from open terrain databases for predictions. The algorithm's performance was validated using real link measurements from a smart grid wireless backhaul network. © 2024 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

In these dimensions, there may be many components that require consideration of the innovation aspect. In the innovation context, using recent technologies is mandatory. Constructing SP for cities is one central aspect of the SC concept, mainly if the SP is built considering the participation of the population, which has been the Brazilian case. Considering the Brazilian scenario, many cities have constructed their specific SPs. A SP of a city considers specific local aspects, including local culture and geographical localization. Another reason a Brazilian city aims to be smarter is both being part of Brazilian SC ranks and receiving specific funding from the federal government for city smart projects. There are many cases in Brazil where the construction process of a city SP counts on the participation of undergraduate and graduate programs of Brazilian universities, as they can contribute to innovative technological solutions, which was the case of Niterói City Hall. The city constructed a program with the Fluminense Federal University (UFF) to meet the goals established in Niterói SP and the 2030 agenda of the United Nations (UN).

In this context, the challenges for IoT and Software Engineering arise from the drive to create smart applications in various domains, such as smart cities, homes, and hospitals. Requirements analysis and software modeling are steps in building IoT systems that aim to ensure a good specification of the system. However, the literature lacks a well-established set of practices for these phases of IoT system development, especially regarding requirements analysis and system modeling. This results in a significant gap in knowledge and standardization of processes. Therefore, a solution that supports these stages of the IoT system development lifecycle is needed.

With this solution, the quality of the software can benefit significantly from using ReqM4IoT, as suggested by the initial evaluation conducted in this work. The evaluation involved five participants with different levels of experience but with a common knowledge base in Software Engineering and IoT. The experiment aimed to evaluate the feasibility, usefulness, and ease of use of the tool in the development of IoT applications. The results indicated that the tool is useful and the participants were able to effectively solve the proposed problem.

The design and implementation of SWM provides significant technical and social challenges, but promises to improve efficiency in water control and consumption. The objective of this study is to investigate SWMs, analyzed using the open design methodology to identify problems, questions, solutions and ideas in their implementation. We understand how SWMs can benefit water management and propose more effective and participatory solutions. The methodology adopted involves three stages: analysis of the case of Company X, selection of cases from the literature, and analysis with Open Design. Analysis is performed using Open Design artifacts to identify stakeholders, questions and problems, and solutions and ideas related to SWMs. As a result, it is possible to identify open problems and questions that need to consider a more participatory and inclusive approach in developing SWM solutions. The use of Open Design is promising and makes stakeholder engagement more effective in creating sustainable and affordable solutions. © 2024 by SCITEPRESS Science and Technology Publications, Lda.},

 abstract = {Interdisciplinarity applied to rural transport in Brazil through expert systems is the focus of this paper. Rural school transport is a challenge, considering the size of Brazil, the great diversity of biomes and insufficient infrastructure. Collaboration between areas by interdisciplinarity articulates individual knowledge through the object and by transdisciplinarity requires developing new knowledge, based on an individual area, going beyond and extrapolating with different criteria. The “Transcolar Rural” intelligent transport system has been developed at the UFMG School of Engineering to plan and manage rural school transport by optimizing routes and costs. The system is used in 13 states in Brazil, 500 municipalities and manages the daily transport of more than 400 thousand students in rural areas. Reducing transportation costs allows resources to be reallocated to other educational activities. The project highlights Brazil's limited resources, recognized by the government, to meet the population's health, education and transport priorities. Transparent information helps managers make decisions and supervise citizens, allowing both parties to determine priorities for resource allocation. The Project demonstrates how interdisciplinarity is effective for complex problems. The project comprehensively addresses the challenges of transporting children in Brazil by integrating technology, exact sciences and applied social sciences. © IMCIC 2024. All rights reserved.},
